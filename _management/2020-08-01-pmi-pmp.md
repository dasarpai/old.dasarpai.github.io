**PMI PMP Course**

## About Course

PMP® stands for Project Management Professional. The Project Management Professional certification is a globally reputed and recognized certification in the field of Project Management, and it is provided to project management professionals, who clear the PMP certification examination. The PMP certification is issued by the Project Management Institute (PMI), which is the world’s leading association of Project Management Professionals.

To write your PMP exam it is mandatory for every applicant to attend 35 contact hours training certificate on Project Management. This training is one of the mandatory requirement for your PMP application.

I have conducted PMI-PMP (Project Management Professional) for hundred of batches and thousands of students across India and APEC region. It is 35 hours workshop. If you cannot stretch in class for more than 9.5 hours every day then I recommend this training for 5 days else 7 hours study every day in four days you will not be enough to get the kind of exposure needed before you start preparing for PMP.
