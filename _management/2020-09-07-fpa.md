**About Course**

Measurement is the basis of Management. It is easy to measure physical things because of their scale for measurement, unit of measurement, the technique of measurement exists and people know them either intuitively or there is a training available. But measuring the size of the software is always a challenge for anybody including project sponsors, project managers, project team, vendors, and regulators. In the last 6 decades, many techniques have been developed but each technique has its own limitation and complexity. Function Point Analysis (FPA) is one of the widely known, accepted, and used techniques for software size measurement. This two days workshop helps participants in understanding different components of software estimation, techniques of estimation, and how to apply this technique to various types of software projects like new product development, supporting a legacy application, enhancing new features in an n-tier architecture banking application, etc.

Based on the organizationâ€™s need other function point techniques like COSMIC FP can be included and the duration of training can be negotiated.

This training is based on Counting Practice Manual 4.2 of The International Function Point Users Group (IFPUG)

## Why this Course

This question always puzzles software project stakeholders that how to estimate the size of a software project. What estimation technique should be used for product revamp or enhancement or support or new-development project? This workshop helps you get answers to these questions and learn how to apply those techniques.

## Prerequisite

Although there is no prerequisite for this course. But if you have 2-3 experience in at least one business domain and finishing a project from start to end you will be able to appreciate every concept in the workshop.
