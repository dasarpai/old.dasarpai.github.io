**PMI-ACP Prep Course**

## About Course

PMI-ACP® Exam Prep course prepares each participant with all the knowledge required to pass the PMI-ACP® in the first attempt. In the course, we will explain to you the agile terminologies, processes, and skills to pass the course with the minimal post-course study. This course is based upon the PMI®-recommended reference materials on Agile, Scrum, XP, Lean, and other Agile methodologies.

As per PMI guidelines you need to have in depth understanding of following topics for passing PMI-ACP exam

There are **63 tasks** (roughly equivalent to major agile practices and major concepts) which are grouped in **7 domains**, for study/improvement purpose, which align the project management philosophy to agile project management philosophy.

**70+ Tools and Techniques** which are grouped in **10 groups of tools and techniques**. These tools and techniques are required to perform 62 tasks of 7 domains.

**33 Knowledge and skills** to master the art of agile project management.

To learn all this, PMI recommends 11 books. In three days training we discuss all the above topics and several other important topics from exam perspective. But we understand that 3 days are not sufficient to digest the concepts from 11 books nor you have too much time to read all the 11 books. Therefore we give our compiled book, which has extract from these 11 books, for the study after training is over.
