**About Course**

Microsoft Project (MSP) is one of the extensive tools used by project managers to prepare project schedules, track project work, optimize resources, and report project progress on day to day basis. Generally, every 2-3 years Microsoft change this product and adds some new feature, modify look and feel, extends some existing features, etc. By 2016 four majorly used versions of this product in the market are MSP 2007, MSP 2010, MSP2013, MSP2016. Depending upon licensing and cost involved organization uses these various versions. The core of all the versions is the same, except for some advanced reporting, view, and analysis functionalities in newer versions. This course helps you understand how to use MSP for your project’s planning.

I am an extensive user of MSP since 1998. Conducted many dozens of training on MSP 2007, 2010, 2013, 2016. The general content outline is as below but based on the organizational need and experience of the audience it can be customized. The duration of the training depends upon the experience level of the audience and the organization’s needs.

## Why this Course

Project scheduling is the core of project planning. When project size is large or involves multiple teams or various types of resources or many external dependencies in that case it is extremely difficult to manage resources, schedule activities, define dependencies, and change dependencies on paper or excel sheet and manage any project successfully. In this situation, you need a reliable tool which can do all the calculation and schedule resources, optimize resources, automatically change-related dependent activities with minimum inputs from project managers.
