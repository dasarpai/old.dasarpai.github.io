**ISO 9001:2008 Consulting**

## About ISO 9001 Certification

ISO (International Organization for Standardization) has hundreds of standards for various business types and various purposes. There are many certification bodies that help individual organizations in getting audited against the requirements documented in standards. ISO 9001 is a quality standard of ISO and one of the highly sought standards in the business world.

Although commonly referred to as ‘ISO 9000’ certification, the actual standard to which an organization’s quality management system can be certified is ISO 9001:2000, 2008, 2017. Every organization which applies for ISO 9001 certification should be audited based on an extensive sample of its sites, functions, products, services, and processes. The auditor presents a list of problems (defined as “nonconformities”, “observations” or “opportunities for improvement”) to management. If there are no major problems/nonconformities, the certification body will issue a certificate. Where major problems/ nonconformities are identified, the organization will present an improvement plan to the audit body; once the audit body is satisfied that the organization has carried out sufficient corrective action, it will issue a certificate. An ISO 9001 certificate is not a once-and-for-all award but must be renewed at regular intervals recommended by the certification body, usually once every three years. There are no grades of competence within ISO 9001: either a company is certified or it is not. In this respect, ISO 9001 certification contrasts with measurement-based quality systems.
