## FAQ

**When can I take this exam?**

Anytime, post training. But before 6 months of course purchase.

**Is this certificate valid for life long?**

No. As with any professional certificate if you are not practicing for a longer period of time or not updating yourself will expire. You need to renew this certificate every 2 years. To renew your certificate you need to earn 40 RCU (recertification units).

**Why Recertification?**

A SCRUMstudy™ certificate should be renewed within **three calendar years** of its issue date. As the Scrum/Agile field is maturing, it is important for practitioners to be abreast of current and latest innovations in the field. For example, the current version of the SBOK™ Guide includes details on Scaling Scrum for Large Projects and Scaling Scrum for the Enterprise. Sections on improving the Scrum Guidance Body and Planning in Scrum have also been updated. Maintaining a certificate enables a student to demonstrate his/her commitment to continuing learning. It also demonstrates the student’s knowledge of Scrum/Agile to employers, peers and colleagues.

Recertification examination: A Recertification course is not as extensive as the Certification course and consists of only half the exam questions. A student can pass the Recertification exam with just a few hours of study. A student passing the Recertification exam implies that the student has reviewed the latest concepts from the SBOK™ Guide. As such, all previous certifications of the student get renewed for 3 years from the date of passing this certification exam.
