# Free SFC™ Certification

Free Scrum Webinar and Virtual Instructor-led Training for SFC™ Scrum Fundamentals Certification.

dasarpAI & SCRUMstudy conducts free 1-hour Scrum webinar followed by 4-hour Virtual Instructor-led training to prepare students for the Scrum Fundamentals Certified (SFC™) certification exam. The training is highly rated by the students and effectively introduces the SCRUMstudy Scrum framework and training methodology to prospective students.

After each topic, participants attempt multiple choice questions using the SCRUMstudy training portal. Participants also get to experience the innovative and interactive Scrum case study tool, where they can discuss and practice scrum concepts in a real-life scenario and learn how scrum helps deliver projects successfully.

After attending this class, participants can take the SFC™ certification exam (which is a one-hour unproctored exam with forty multiple-choice questions), and get the highly valued SFC™ credential.
