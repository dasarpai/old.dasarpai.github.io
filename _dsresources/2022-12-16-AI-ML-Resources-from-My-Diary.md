![AI ML Resources from My Diary](/assets/images/dspost/dsr121-AI-ML-Resources-from-My-Diary.jpg)

This is my personal diary which contains resources, which I know, learned or people have told me
to experiment with. I started writing this diary in Mar’ 2019. This diary is related to my work/learning
in data science, AI, ML, NLP, DL, GNN, GAN, Statistics, etc. A few links related to Software
Development, People Management, Project Management are also kept in this diary. The resources
here are python/R library link, blog articles, YouTube video links, article links, AI products links,
architecture, images etc. The Table of Content and Content of this diary is not any specific order.
Whatever I was/am getting I keep adding into this, mostly towards the end but not always.

This is a 390 page personal learning diary and it contains approx 1000 resources. List of the resources available in this file are mentioned below.
