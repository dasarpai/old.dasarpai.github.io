       " 1: '## SECTION I.\\n \\n On the Rākshasas having been slain, all the ascetics, for the purpose of\\n congratulating Rāghava, came to Rāma as he gained (back) his kingdom.\\n Kauçika, and Yavakrita, and Gārgya, and Gālava, and Kanva—son unto\\n Mādhālithi,—who dwelt in the east, (came thither); and the reverend\\n Swastyāstreya, and Namuchi, and Pramuchi, and Agastya, and the\\n worshipful Atri, and Sumukha, and Vimukha,—who dwelt in the south,—came\\n in company with Agastya.¹ And Nrishadgu, and Kahashi, and Dhaumya, and\\n that mighty sage—Kauçeya—who abode in the western quarter, came there\\n accompanied by their disciples. And Vasishtha and Kaçyapa and Atri and\\n Viçwamitra with Gautama and Jamadagni and Bharadwaja and also the seven\\n sages,² who for aye resided in the northern quarter, (came there). And\\n on arriving at the residence of Rāghava, those high-souled ones,\\n resembling the fire in radiance, stopped at the gate, with the intention\\n of communicating their arrival (to Rāma) through the warder. And that\\n foremost of ascetics—the righteous Agastya—versed in various branches of\\n learning and cognizant of the Vedas along with their branches,—addressed\\n the warder, saying,—\"Do thou say unto Daçaratha’s son that we—the\\n sages—have come (here).\" Then at the words of Agastya, the gate-keeper\\n quick³ and swift presented himself with celerity before the high-souled\\n Rāghava. And that one versed in polity and emotional expressions, of\\n worthy ways, possessed of ability and endowed with patience, swiftly\\n seeing Rāma resembling the full moon in brightness, communicated unto\\n him the arrival of that supreme of saints—Agastya. Hearing of the\\n arrival of the anchorets, possessed of the effulgence of the sun\\n new-risen, he answered the warder, saying,—\"Do thou usher them in,\\n having regard to their comfort.\" And seeing the ascetics before him,\\n Rāma with joined hands worshipped their feet with _arghyas_, and with\\n regard consecrated a cow unto each, and saluting them with a collected\\n mind, he ordered seats (for the saints). And having, according to their\\n rank, seated themselves on gorgeous and superb seats of Kuça or\\n deer-skins embroidered with gold, those foremost of sages—those mighty\\n saints, versed in the Vedas,—along with their disciples and leaders,\\n having (previously) been asked as to their welfare, addressed Rāma,\\n saying,—\"O son of Raghu. O mighty-armed one, complete welfare is ours.\\n By good luck it is that we see thee fortunate, with all thy foes\\n finished. By good luck it is that, O king, Rāvana—destroyer of\\n creatures—hath been slain by thee. Sure, O Rāma, it was no great matter\\n for thee (to slay) Rāvana along with his sons and grandsons. Furnished\\n with thy bow, thou canst, without doubt, destroy the three worlds\\n themselves. By good fortune it is, O Rāma, that Rāvana along with his\\n sons and grandsons hath been slain by thee. By good fortune it is that\\n to-day we see thee victorious along with Sitā, and, O righteous-souled\\n one, with thy brother, Lakshmana, (ever) compassing thy profit. (By good\\n fortune it is) that, O king, to-day we behold (thee) in company with thy\\n mothers and thy brothers. By good fortune it is that those\\n night-rangers, Prahasta, and Vikata, and Virupāksha, and Mahodara, and\\n the unconquerable Akampana, have all been slain (by thee). By good\\n fortune it is, O Rāma, that he than whose proportions there are no\\n other’s greater on earth,—even Kumbhakarna, was brought down (by thee).\\n By good luck it is, O Rāma, that those highly powerful night-rangers.\\n Triçiras and Atikāya and Devāntaka and Narāntaka, have been slain by\\n thee. By good luck it is that thou hadst been encountered in a\\n hand-to-hand combat with that foremost of Rākshasas, incapable of being\\n slain by the celestials themselves; and achieved victory (ultimately).\\n To defeat Rāvana in battle was (for thee) a small matter; but it is a\\n piece of good fortune that Rāvana’s son, who had confronted thee for\\n combat, hath been slain (by thee) in battle. By good fortune it is that\\n thou, O mighty-armed one, hadst been liberated from (the bonds of) that\\n foe of the celestials whose course resembled that of Time⁴;—and that\\n thou also hadst secured victory. Hearing of the destruction of Indrajit,\\n we congratulate thee (on thy success). He was incapable of being slain\\n by all creatures, and in battle possessed mighty powers of illusion.\\n Hearing that Indrajit slain, amazement hath seized us all. Having\\n conferred on us this holy freedom from fear, O Kākutstha, O repressor of\\n enemies, thou through good fortune, wilt grow in victory.\" Hearing the\\n speech of the ascetics of sacred souls, Rāma, coming under the influence\\n of a mighty wonder, said with joined hands,—\"Ye worshipful ones,\\n wherefore, passing by those exceedingly powerful ones Kumbhakarna and\\n the night-ranger, Rāvana—do ye praise Rāvana’s son? Wherefore, passing\\n by Mahodara, and Prahasta, and the Rākshasa—Virupaksha—and Matta, and\\n Unmatta, and the irrepressible Devāntaka and Narāntaka—redoubtable\\n heroes all—do ye extoll Rāvana’s son? And wherefore, passing by Atikāya\\n and Triçiras and Dhumrāksha,—that night-ranger—all endowed with\\n exceeding prowess,—do you extoll Rāvana’s son? What was his prowess? And\\n what his strength? And what his might? And by virtue of what cause did\\n he surpass Rāvana? If I can well hear the same, (do ye tell it me). I by\\n no means command you. If the thing can bear disclosure, I would hear it.\\n Pray, speak out. How was Sakra vanquished by him, and how also did he\\n obtain the boon? And how was the son powerful,—and not his sire—Rāvana?\\n How could that Rākshasa, surpassing his sire, conquer Sakra in mighty\\n encounter, and how did he obtain the boon? O foremost of anchorets, do\\n thou to-day unfold all this unto me, who ask (for the same).\"\\n \\n     ¹ The name of Agastya had before been just specified among the\\n       incomers; but so it is in the text.—T.\\n \\n     ² _Ursa Major_, or the great bear, the seven stars of which are the\\n       souls of as many saints,—Marichi, Atrai, Angiras, Pulastya,\\n       Pulaha, Kratu and Vasistha.—T\\n \\n     ³ _Turnam_—according to the commentator, is _mental celerity_, and\\n       _drutam—physical_. This distinction, however, is seldom, if ever,\\n       observed by Sanskrit authors.—T.\\n \\n     ⁴ _i.e._ surpassing perception.—T.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 2: '## SECTION II.\\n \\n \\n Hearing those words of his, the exceedingly energetic Kumbhayoni spoke\\n as follows,—\"Having regard to his (Indrajit’s) energy and might, I shall\\n relate unto thee the history of his race, in the light of which thou\\n wilt perceive why Rāvana’s son had been capable of slaying his enemies,\\n but could not himself be slain by them. I shall, O Rāghava, describe\\n unto thee Rāvana’s race and birth, as well as the boon that had been\\n conferred on him.\\n \\n \"Formerly in the Krita age, O Rāma, there was a Brahmarshi—lord (of\\n creatures)—son unto Prajāpati, and like unto the very self of the\\n great-father. His virtues, springing from righteousness and excellency\\n of character, are past all delineation; I can only say that, forsooth,\\n he went by the name of Prajāpati’s son. Verily on account of his being\\n the son of Prajāpati, he was the darling of the deities; as by virtue of\\n his spotless perfections, that magnanimous one was loved of all\\n creatures. And on a religious mission that foremost of ascetics,\\n repairing to the asylum of Trinavindu at the side of the mighty\\n mountain, Meru, took up his abode there. And with his senses centered on\\n the study of the Vedas, that righteous-souled one, going to the\\n hermitage, carried on austerities; but his religious rites were\\n disturbed by certain girls. And daughters of sages and Pannagas and\\n those of Rājarshis,—as well as those of Apsarās, sporting, arrived at\\n that quarter. And on account of every season being genial at that spot\\n and also of the loveliness of the wood, the damsels, repairing to this\\n place, ever disport there. And on account of the beauty of that region,\\n those wenches, coming to where that twice-born one, Pulastya was, used\\n to sing, to play on instruments, and to dance; and thus those blameless\\n beauties disturbed the rites of that anchoret practising austerities.\\n Thereat, the mighty ascetic, waxing wroth, said,—’She that comes within\\n my kin, shall conceive.’ Hearing the words of the high-souled one, (the\\n damsels), afraid of a Brāhmana’s curse, ceased to haunt that place. But\\n Trinavindu’s daughter had not heard anything of all this; and, going to\\n the asylum, she ranged it fearlessly. And she did not see there any of\\n her associates come to that spot. And at that time that exceedingly\\n energetic and mighty sage, Prajāpati’s son, with his soul sanctified\\n through asceticism, was engaged in the study of the Veda. And, hearing\\n the sounds of Vaidika recitation, and seeing that storehouse of\\n asceticism, she had her body turned pale, and signs of pregnancy\\n displayed themselves. And, seeing that evil befall her, she was wrought\\n up with anxiety; and, understanding matters, she said,—’What is this?’\\n And, going to her father’s hermitage, stayed there. And, seeing her in\\n this condition, Trinavindu said,—’Wherefore is the person that thou\\n bearest unlike what it used to be?’ Thereat, in woe-begone guise, with\\n joined hands, his daughter replied unto that one having asceticism for\\n his riches,—’O father, cause know I none whereby I have come by this\\n appearance. But, searching for my associates, I had ere this alone\\n repaired to the noble asylum of the Maharshi Pulastya of a purified\\n spirit. But associate found there I none, that had come thither. And\\n seeing this change for the worse of my form, I from fear have come\\n hither.’ Thereat the Rajarshi, Trinavindu, having a live effulgence\\n through asceticism, entered into contemplation, and saw the consequence\\n of the sage’s act. And coming to know that curse of the Maharshi of a\\n purified spirit, he, taking his daughter, went to Pulastya and said,—’O\\n worshipful one, O mighty sage, do thou accept this daughter of mine,\\n adorned with her native perfections, who of herself hath come to thee as\\n alms.⁵ She will, without doubt, constantly tend thee, practising\\n asceticism, and having thy senses fatigued.’ When that virtuous (sage)\\n had said this, the twice-born Rajarshi, desirous of accepting the girl\\n (after due nuptial rites), said unto the former,—’Well!’ Having given\\n away his daughter, the king went (back) to his asylum; and the girl\\n stayed there, gratifying her husband with her virtues. And that best of\\n ascetics was gratified with her character and behavior. And well pleased\\n (with her), that highly energetic one said,—’O thou of shapely hips,\\n well-pleased am I with thee with thy wealth of worth, and therefore, O\\n exalted one, I will to-day confer on thee a son like unto thyself, who\\n will perpetuate both the lines⁶—being celebrated as Paulastya. And as\\n thou hadst heard the Veda recited by me, so, without doubt, he shall be\\n named _Viçravā_.’⁷ Thus addressed, that noble damsel with her soul\\n wrought up with delight, in a short time brought forth her son _Viçravā_\\n famed over the three worlds and furnished with virtue and fame; versed\\n in the Vedas, of an impartial spirit, and ever engaged in observing\\n vows. And the ascetic, _Viçravā_, was furnished with asceticism even\\n like his sire.\"\\n \\n     ⁵ Compare Lear:—’Let your study be to content your lord who hath\\n       received you at fortune’s _alms_.’—Act I., Scene I., lines 67—69.\\n \\n     ⁶ _i.e._ maternal and paternal lines.\\n \\n     ⁷ From the root, _Sru—to hear_.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 3: '## SECTION III.\\n \\n \\n \"And Pulastya’s son—that prime of ascetics—Viçravā—in a short time was\\n engaged in asceticism like his father. And he was truthful, and of\\n excellent character and controlled senses; was ever engaged in the study\\n of the Vedas; and was of a sanctified spirit; and he was not addicted to\\n any of the pleasures of life, and was always studious of religion.\\n Learning of his ways, that mighty ascetic, Bharadwāja, gave unto Viçravā\\n for his wife, his own daughter, Devavarnini. And having religiously wed\\n Bharadwāja’s daughter, that foremost of ascetics, Viçravā, conceiving\\n the highest delight, began to reflect on the welfare of his offspring\\n with an intelligence concentrated on them. And on her that one cognizant\\n of righteousness begot a child, exceedingly wonderful, endowed with\\n energy, and adorned with all Brahmā⁸ qualities. On his having been born,\\n his grand-father was rejoiced, and, marking the profitable intelligence\\n (of the boy, he thought that) he would be the lord of riches. And\\n well-pleased, (Pulastya) in company with the Devarshis\\n (thought),—’Inasmuch as this is Viçravā’s offspring, and as he resembles\\n Viçravā himself, so he should be known by the name of Vaiçravana. And\\n then the exceedingly energetic Vaiçravana, repairing to the wood of\\n asceticism, increased (in power) like unto a fire fed by sacrificial\\n oblations. And as he was staying in the hermitage, that high-souled one\\n thought,—’I shall practise prime righteousness: verily virtue is the\\n supreme way.’ And for a thousand years, he, having his senses\\n controlled, practised rigid austerities in that mighty forest, observing\\n (all the while) the most rigorous restrictions. And on a thousand years\\n having been numbered, he by turns observed the rules relative to each\\n term; (at first) living on water, (then) on air, and (last) going\\n absolutely without any fare. Thus passed away a thousand years like one.\\n And then the highly energetic Brahmā along with Indra and the\\n celestials, coming to that asylum, addressed (Vaiçravana), saying,—’O\\n child, I am well-pleased with thee for this act of thine, O thou of\\n excellent vows. Do thou, good betide thee, ask for the boon (that thou\\n wouldst have), for, O magnanimous one, thou art worthy of a boon. 9 Then\\n Vaiçravana said unto the great-father, who was present,—’O reverend one,\\n I crave for the power of maintaining and protecting people.’ Thereat,\\n Brahmā along with the deities gladly said in a gratified spirit,—’Very\\n well! I am about to create the fourth of the Protectors of\\n creatures—Yama, Indra and Varuna,—the position which is sought for by\\n thee. Do thou, O thou cognizant of righteousness, attain the same; do\\n thou receive the position of the lord of riches. Thou shalt be the\\n fourth among Sakra, the lord of waters, etc. And do thou take for thy\\n vehicle this car, named Pushpaka, resembling the Sun himself, and thus\\n raise thyself to an equality with the celestials. Good betide thee! We\\n shall (now) go whither we had come, having, my child, done my duty and\\n bestowed on thee the couple of boons.’ Having said this, Brahmā along\\n with the celestials went to his own quarters. On the deities with Brahmā\\n at their head, having departed for the heavenly regions, the\\n self-possessed lord of wealth of subdued senses with joined hands spoke\\n unto his sire, saying,—’O reverend one, I have received the wished-for\\n boon from the great-father, but the exalted lord of creatures hath not\\n fixed any abode for me. Therefore, O lord, do thou seek out some\\n dwelling for me, where no creature whatever can come by misfortune.’\\n Thus accosted by his son, that best of ascetics, Viçravā, spoke, O\\n righteous one,—’Listen! O excellent one. On the shore of the Southern\\n sea there is a mount named Trikuta. On its brow is a beautiful and broad\\n city built by Viçwakarmā, named Lankā, resembling the city itself of\\n Indra the great, designed for the abode of Rākshasas,—like unto the\\n Amaravati of Indra. There in Lankā, do thou, forsooth, reside. That\\n romantic city is surrounded with a golden wall and a moat, and is\\n furnished with engines and weapons; and hath gateways of gold and\\n lapises. Formerly she was renounced by the Rākshasas afflicted with the\\n fear of Vishnu; and was empty of swarms of Rakshas, who had gone to the\\n nethermost regions. Now Lankā is vacant,—and there is no one that lords\\n it over her. Do thou, my child, for abode, at thine ease repair thither.\\n Thy stay there shall meet with no rub, and no manner of disturbance\\n shall occur there.’ Hearing the righteous speech of his sire, that\\n virtuous-souled one along with thousands of delighted and joyous\\n Rākshasas, began to reside in Lankā stationed on the top of the mount.\\n In a short time (Lankā), through his sway, abounded (in wealth). And\\n that foremost of Nairitas, the righteous son of Viçravā, well-pleased,\\n abode in Lankā having the Ocean for her entrenchment. At times the\\n righteous-souled lord of riches, mounted on Pushpaka, in humble guise\\n visited his father and mother. And hymned by hosts of deities and\\n Gandharvas, having his mansion graced with the dancing of Apsarās, and\\n floating on rays like the sun himself, that ruler of riches went to his\\n sire.\"\\n \\n     ⁸ Such as self-control, asceticism, purity, etc.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 4: '## SECTION IV.\\n \\n \\n Hearing the words uttered by Agastya, Rāma wondered as to how formerly\\n Rākshasas were generated in Lankā. And then shaking his head, he, struck\\n with wonder, momentarily eying Agastya, addressed Agastya resembling\\n fire, saying,—\"O worshipful one, hearing thy words that formerly Lankā\\n had been in the possession of the flesh-eaters, I have been seized with\\n great amazement. We had heard that the Rākshasas had sprung in the race\\n of Pulastya. But now thou hast said that they owe their origin to a\\n different source. But were they more powerful than Rāvana and\\n Kumbhakarna and Prahasta and Vikata and the sons of Rāvana? Who was\\n their progenitor? And what was the name of that one of terrific\\n strength? And through what transgression were they driven out by Vishnu?\\n All this, O sinless one, do thou tell me in detail, and do thou dispell\\n my curiosity even as the sun dispells darkness.\"\\n \\n Hearing Rāghava’s words, fair and fraught with polished phrase and\\n period, Agastya, struck with surprise, said unto Rāghava,—\"The lord of\\n creatures sprung from water, first created water. And the lotus-born one\\n generated creatures for protecting that element. And thereupon those\\n creatures humbly presented themselves before the creator, saying,—’What\\n shall we do? We are sore tried by hunger and thirst.’ The lord of\\n creatures, laughing, addressed them, saying,—’Ye men, do ye carefully\\n guard this (water).’ Thereat some said ’Rakshāma,’⁹ and others\\n ’Yakshāma.’¹⁰ Thus accosted by those afflicted with hunger and thirst,\\n the creator said,—’Those among you who have said ’Rakshāma,’ shall be\\n Rākshasas; and those among you who have said ‘Yakshāma,’ shall be\\n Yakshas. And there sprang the brothers—repressors of foes—Heti and\\n Praheti—lords of Rākshasas, resembling Madhu Kaitava himself. Praheti,\\n who was righteous, went to the wood of asceticism. And Heti exerted\\n himself to the utmost to get himself wived. And that magnanimous one of\\n immeasurable soul married the exceedingly terrific sister of Kāla, named\\n Bhaya.¹¹ And on her Heti—foremost of Rākshasas and best of those having\\n sons—begat a son, known as Vidyutkeça. And Heti’s son, the exceedingly\\n energetic Vidyutkeça, possessed of the splendour of the sun, grew up\\n even like a lotus in water. And when that night-ranger arrived at proper\\n youth, his sire turned his attention towards his marriage. And that best\\n of Rākshasas—Heti—in the interests of his son asked for the hand of\\n Sandhyā’s daughter, like unto Sandhyā¹² herself in potency. Sandhyā,\\n reflecting that she needs must have to be given away by her, bestowed\\n her on Vidyutkeça, O Rāghava. Having obtained Sandhyā’s daughter, the\\n night-ranger, Vidyutkeça, sports with her even as Maghavān doth with the\\n daughter of Pulomā. And it came to pass that after a length of time, O\\n Rāma, Sāla Katankatā was filled with child by Vidyutkeça, as the clouds\\n are furnished with water by the Ocean. And then repairing to Mandara,\\n the Rākshasi brought forth her child, having the splendour of\\n rain-charged clouds; even as Gangā had delivered herself of the child\\n begotten by Fire.¹³ And having delivered herself of her offspring, she\\n again became bent on disporting with Vidyutkeça. And then forsaking her\\n son, she began to sport with her husband; and the child having sounds\\n resembling the rumbling of clouds, was renounced (by his mother). And\\n forsaken by them both, the infant furnished with the brightness of the\\n autumnal sun, entering his clenched fist into his mouth, began to cry\\n slowly. And it so fell that, journeying with Pārvati, Siva, riding his\\n bull through the aerial regions, heard the sounds of weeping. And along\\n with Umā, he saw the Rākshasa’s son, as he was crying. And sent by\\n Pārvati, whose heart was moved by compassion, Bhava—destroyer of\\n Tripurā—made that Rākshasa’s offspring attain the age of his mother, and\\n conferred on him immortality. And for compassing Pārvati’s pleasure,\\n Mahādeva, indestructible and undeteriorating, granted (the Rākshasa) the\\n power of ranging the air. And, O son of the king, Umā also bestowed a\\n boon: ’Henceforth the Rākshasis shall conceive in a day, bring forth\\n (child) in a day, and the child shall in a day be furnished with the age\\n of its mother.’ And then the great and magnanimous Sukeça, puffed up\\n with the receipt of the boons, having obtained auspiciousness at the\\n hands of the lord, Hara, began to range everywhere, even as Purandara\\n did on having obtained heaven.\"\\n \\n     ⁹ _i.e._ _We shall protect._\\n \\n    ¹⁰ _We shall worship._\\n \\n    ¹¹ _Fear._\\n \\n    ¹² The evening Twilight, spouse of the Sun.\\n \\n    ¹³ Maheçwara.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 5: '## SECTION V.\\n \\n \\n \"Seeing Sukeça righteous and furnished with the boon, a virtuous\\n Gandharva, named Grāmani, of the effulgence of fire, who had a daughter,\\n called Devavati, like unto a second Sri herself, famed over the three\\n worlds, and endowed with beauty and youth,—bestowed her on Sukega as if\\n he had bestowed the goddess of fortune of the Rakshas. And like an\\n indigent person on obtaining wealth, Devavati, on obtaining her beloved\\n husband, affluent in consequence of having received the boon, was\\n (greatly) delighted. And in her company, that night-ranger appeared\\n graceful, even as a mighly elephant sprung from Anjana¹⁴ doth in the\\n company of a she-elephant. In good time Sukeça, O Rāghava, begot (on\\n her) three sons, resembling the three Fires, And that lord of Rākshasas\\n begot (on her) three sons, resembling his three eyes—the Rākshasas\\n Malyavān, Sumāli and that foremost of the strong—Māli; all resembling\\n the three worlds possessing themselves in calmness; like unto the three\\n Fires established; fierce like unto the three vinntras,—dreadful like\\n three diseases springing respectively from morbid Air, Bile and\\n Phlegm.¹⁵ And the sons of Sukeça, having the energy of the three Fires,\\n grew up like a disease which hath been disregarded. And learning that\\n their father had received a boon by virtue of his power proceeding from\\n asceticism, the brothers, firmly resolved, went to Meru for practising\\n penances. And adopting rigid restrictions, the Rākshasas, O best of\\n kings, entered upon austerities, terrible, and capable of arousing the\\n fear of all beings. And practising penances rare on earth with truth and\\n candour and self-control, they afflicted the three worlds with gods,\\n Asuras and human beings. Then that lord—the four-faced one—stationed on\\n a superb car, addressed Sukeça’s sons, saying,—’I am for conferring\\n boons (on you).’ Knowing that Brahmā surrounded by Indra and the other\\n celestials was ready to bestow boons, they, with joined hands, said,\\n trembling like trees, ‘O god that hast been adored through asceticism,\\n if thou dost intend to confer on us a boon, let us be invincible,\\n capable of slaying foes, immortal, lordly, and ever devoted to each\\n other.’ Thereat, saying ‘So be it,’ unto the sons of Sukeça, the lord\\n Brahmā, (ever) cherishing Brāhmanas with affection, went to the Brahmā\\n regions. O Rāma, having obtained the boons, those night-rangers,\\n rendered intrepid in consequence of having the boon conferred on them,\\n began to disturb celestials and Asuras. And like unto men abiding in\\n hell, the celestials, Charanas and hosts of sages, being harassed (by\\n Rakshasas), did not find any deliverer. And then, O foremost of the\\n Raghus, the Rakshasas, assembled together, joyfully said unto the\\n undeteriorating Viçwakarmā—prince of artists,—‘Thou by thy own energy\\n art the architect of the great gods, endowed with energy and prowess and\\n strength. Do thou, O magnanimous one, construct a fabric for us after\\n our heart hard by Himavān, or Meru, or Mandara. And do thou erect a\\n magnificent mansion for us resembling the mansion itself of Maheçwara.’\\n Thereat Viçwakarmā—the mighty-arm of the Rakshasas—spoke of a building\\n like the Amarāvati of Sakra, ‘On the shore of the Southern sea is a\\n mountain named Trikuta. A second also is there called Suvela, ye lords\\n of Rākshasas. On the midmost peak of that mountain resembling clouds,\\n inaccessible even to the fowls of the air, all the four quarters have\\n been hewn with bones.¹⁶ If I am desired by you, I can construct the city\\n of Lankā (there), having an area of thirty Yojanas, and measuring an\\n hundred in length; surrounded with a golden wall and furnished with\\n golden gateways. In her do ye dwell, ye irrepressible ones, ye foremost\\n of Rākshasas; even as do the celestials with Indra, approaching\\n Amarāvati, And occupying the citadel of Lankā, backed by innumerable\\n Rākshasas, ye will be invincible to foes and capable of destroying\\n them.’ Hearing Viçwakarmā’s speech, those foremost of Rakshasas,\\n accompanied by thousands of followers, went to the palace and set up in\\n the same, having a strong wall and a moat, abounding in hundreds of\\n golden edifices. And obtaining Lankā, the night-rangers, exceedingly\\n delighted, began to dwell therein. At this time, O Rāghava, there lived\\n at her pleasure a Gandharvi, named Narmadā. O son of Raghu, she had\\n three daughters, resembling Sri, Hri, and Kirti in splendour. And albeit\\n no Rākshasi herself, she, beginning with the eldest, gladly married to\\n the Rākshasas her daughters having faces resembling the full moon. And\\n under the influence of the star, Bhagadaivata, those three exalted\\n daughters of a Gandharvi were respectively conferred by their mother on\\n the three several Rākshasas of eminence. And having wedded, O Rāma,\\n Sukeça’s sons began to sport with their wives, like celestials sporting\\n with Apsarās. Malyavān’s beautiful spouse was named Sundari. On her he\\n begot, do thou understand, whom;—Vajramusthi, and Virupāksha, and the\\n Rākshasa—Burmukha,—and Suptaghna, and Yajnakopa, and Matta and Unmatta;\\n and, O Rāma, there was also born a lovely daughter of Sundari, Analā.\\n And Sumāli’s wife, of face like the full Moon, named Ketumati, was\\n dearer to him than his life itself. O mighty king, do thou, gradually,\\n know the offspring that were begot by Sumāli on Ketumati,—Prahasta, and\\n Kampana, and Vikata, and Kālikāmukha, and Dhumrāksha, and Danda, and the\\n redoubtable Supārcwa, and Sanhrādi, and Praghasa, and the Rākshasa,\\n Bhāsakarna, and Rākā, and Pashpotkatā, and Kaikasi of luminous smiles,\\n and Kumbhinasi—these are known as the offspring of Sumāli. Māli had for\\n wife a graceful Gandharvi, having eyes resembling lotus-petals, of a\\n lovely look, and like unto the most magnificent Yakshi of them all. Do\\n thou, O master, listen to me as I mention to thee, O Rāghava, the\\n offspring that Sumāli’s younger brother begat on her,—Anala, and Nila,\\n and Sampāti. These night-rangers—sons unto Māli—were the courtiers of\\n Bibhisana. And those three foremost of Rākshasas, accompanied by\\n hundreds of sons—night-rangers all—elated on account of their\\n measureless prowess, began to worry the sages and serpents and Yakshas,\\n and celestials with Indra (at their head). And incapable of being\\n confronted (in battle), these resembling Death himself in\\n energy,—wondrous elated in consequence of the boon having been conferred\\n on them, ranging the world like unto the Wind, were ever engaged in\\n disturbing the sacrifices (of the sages).\"\\n \\n    ¹⁴ The designation of an elephant.\\n \\n    ¹⁵ The entire edifice of Hindu Pathology is based on the three-fold\\n       division of the morbid humours into Air, Bile and Phlegm. This\\n       division, albeit it may appear crude and unscientific to\\n       Europeans, taken all, in all, wonderfully answers its purpose. The\\n       tact displayed by Hindu physicians in diagnosing diseases on this\\n       method is wonderful. From feeling the Pulse alone, a Hindu\\n       physician, getting at the predominance of one or more morbid\\n       humours of the system, can accurately ascertain a patient’s\\n       health. The infallibility with which predictions of death are\\n       generally made, attests the scientific soundness of the division\\n       in question, and renders superfluous any elaborate argument in its\\n       defense.—T.\\n \\n    ¹⁶ Tanka—may also mean a hatchet or a sword.—T,\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",

Therefore, god, it\\n behoveth thee to liberate us from fear, who have been greatly tormented\\n by it. Do thou, assuming thy terrific form, slay the thorns of the\\n celestials.\" Thus addressed by the immortals in a body, that lord,\\n Kaparddi of red-blue hue, reflecting that it would be wrong for him to\\n destroy Sukeça (with his own hands), spoke unto the gods:—\"I shall not\\n slay them, ye gods; they are incapable of being slain by me. But I shall\\n unfold unto you the way in which they will be destroyed. Do ye, ye\\n Maharshis, in the heat of this affair, seek the shelter of Vishnu. That\\n lord will slay them.\" Thereat, saluting Maheçwara with the sounds of\\n _Jaya_, (the celestials) afflicted with the fear of the night-rangers,\\n presented themselves before Vishnu. And bowing down unto the god holding\\n the conch, discus and mace, and paying him high homage, they, greatly\\n flurried, addressed him about the sons of Sukeça, saying,—\"O god, by\\n virtue of the boon (that hath been bestowed on them), resembling the\\n three fires, Sukeça’s three sons, assailing us, have deprived us of our\\n abode. There is a city named Lankā, stationed on the top of Trikuta,\\n (extremely) difficult of entrance. Taking up their station at that\\n place, the night-rangers in a body pursue us. Do thou, O slayer of\\n Madhu, destroy them for our welfare. We have sought thy shelter. Become\\n our refuge, O foremost of celestials. Do thou dedicate to Yama the\\n lotuses of their faces, severed (in pieces) with thy discus. Save thee,\\n we have none who can, while tormented with fright, inspire us with\\n courage. Slay in encounter the elated Rākshasas along with their\\n adherents; and even as the sun drieth up dew, do thou dispell this fear\\n of ours.\" Thus accosted by the deities, that god of gods—Janārddana—who\\n bringeth fear unto foes—cheering up the celestials, said unto them,—\"I\\n know the Rākshasa, Sukeça, as flushed with the boon bestowed by Içāna.\\n And I also know his sons, of whom Malyavān is the eldest. Those worst of\\n Rākshasas that have over-riden your dignity will I, wrought up with\\n wrath, slay (in battle); therefore, ye gods, be of good cheer.\" Thus\\n addressed by the mighty Vishnu, the gods, highly rejoiced, went to their\\n respective quarters, extolling Janārdana.\\n \\n \"And hearing of the activity of the celestials, the\\n night-ranger—Malyavān—addressed his heroic brothers, saying,—’The\\n immortals and sages, going to Sankara, spake these words, desirous of\\n our destruction,—The terrific sons of Sukeça, puffed up, and swollen on\\n account of their strength flowing from the boon, are crossing us at\\n every step. We have been overpowered by the Rākshasas. And, O lord of\\n creatures, from fear of those wicked-minded ones, we cannot remain in\\n our own homes. Therefore, to do us good, do thou, O three-eyed one,\\n destroy them; and, O best of consuming ones, do thou with thy roars,\\n burn them up.—Thus addressed by the deities, the slayer of Andhaka,\\n hearing their speech, said, shaking his head and hands,—Ye gods,\\n Sukeça’s sons are incapable of being slain by me in battle. But I shall\\n tell you the means whereby they may be slain. Do ye seek the shelter of\\n him who holdeth the discus and mace in his hands, and who is clad in a\\n yellow attire,—of Janārdana, Hari, even of the auspicious\\n Nārāyana.—Having received this counsel of Hara, they, rendering\\n reverence unto that enemy of Kāma, came to the abode of Nārāyana and\\n communicated everything unto him. Then Nārāyana spoke unto the\\n celestials with Indra at their head,—I will slay those foes of the\\n celestials. Ye gods, cast off all fear!—O foremost of Rākshasas, Hari\\n promised unto the frightened celestials that he would slay us. Therefore\\n do ye think as to what is fit. Hiranyakaçipu hath met with death (at the\\n hands of Hari), as also other enemies of the immortals.

It is a sore task to defeat Nārāyana, who wisheth to slay us.’\\n Thereat Sumāli and Māli, hearing the words of Mālyavān, said unto their\\n eldest brother, like the Acwins addressing Vāsava,—’We have studied,\\n performed sacrifices, practised charity, and obtained riches; and\\n attaining long health and long life, we have established sterling\\n righteousness in our path. And with arms plunging into the sea of\\n celestials, we have conquered our unrivalled enemies. Therefore, we have\\n no fear touching death. Even Nārāyana and Rudra, Sakra and Yama, ever\\n fear to stay before us (in the field). And, O lord of Rākshasas, there\\n is no occasion for Vishnu’s displeasure of us. The mind of Vishnu hath\\n wavered in consequence of the evil caused by the celestials. Therefore\\n will we even avenge ourselves on the gods, from whom hath sprung this\\n wrong.’ Having taken counsel together, those powerful ones conciliated\\n their forces. And proclaiming (their order) that preparations were to be\\n made, all the foremost Nairitas sallied forth for battle, like unto\\n those led by Jamva and Vritra. And, O Rāma, having thus taken counsel\\n together, with all the preparations complete, those huge-bodied and\\n redoubtable Rakshas marched forth for conflict, mounted on cars, and\\n elephants, and horses resembling elephants, and mules, and kine, and\\n camels, and purpoises,¹⁸ and serpents, _makaras_, and tortoises, and\\n fishes, and fowls resembling Garuda himself, lions and tigers and boars\\n and _Srimaras_¹⁹ and _Chāmaras_.²⁰ And puffed up with pride of prowess,\\n the Rakshas march, leaving Lankā, and the enemies of the celestials went\\n to the heavenly regions for battle. And perceiving the destruction of\\n Lankā at hand, those deities that had taken up their quarters there,\\n everywhere were struck with fear and felt their spirits depressed. And\\n mounting the best of cars, the Rākshasas by hundreds and thousands with\\n intent minds swiftly sallied forth for the celestial regions. And the\\n deities (aforementioned) followed the tract of the Rākshasas. And at the\\n command of Kāla, terrible evil omens foreshadowing the destruction of\\n the Rākshasa-chiefs began to arise on the earth well as in the sky. The\\n clouds showered down bones and hot blood. The oceans overleapt their\\n continents;²¹ and the mountains shook. And jackals of terrific forms,\\n having voices resembling the roaring of clouds,—bursting out into a\\n horse-laugh, began to emit cries frightfully. Creatures were one after\\n another seen to drop down; and mighty swarms of vultures, with mouths\\n belching forth flames, began to wheel over the Rākshasa, like unto Kāla\\n himself. And blood-footed pigeons and Sārikās²² darted off (around). And\\n crows and two-legged cats began to cry in loud accents. But fast bound\\n with the noose of Death, the Rākshasas, proud of their strength,\\n disregarding these omens, march on, and do not stay their\\n course,—Mālyavān and Sumāli possessed of prodigious strength, going\\n before the Rākshasas, like flaming fires. And even as the gods take\\n refuge under Dhata, the night-rangers take refuge under Malyavān\\n resembling the mountain, Malyavān. And under the command of Māli, that\\n host of Rākshasas, roaring like mighty clouds, inspired with the desire\\n of victory, went to the celestial regions.

And Vishnu of a bright brown-blue hue, being\\n surrounded by the flower of the night-rangers with dark visages,\\n resembled the mountain, Anjana, on which the clouds pour down. And as\\n locusts (flood) a field, gnats (throng) about a flame, gad-flies\\n (cluster) around a pot of honey, or _makaras_ (range) the deep, so the\\n shafts shot by the bows of the Rakhas, having (the energy of) the\\n thunder-bolt and endowed with (the velocity of) the wind or thought,\\n pierce Hari as if at the universal dissolution. And those mounted on\\n cars (assailed him) with their cars, and those mounted on the backs of\\n elephants (assailed him) with their elephants, and those riding horses\\n (assailed him) with their horses, and the foot-soldiers attacked him,\\n stationed in the sky; and the foremost of Rākshasas resembling\\n mountains, by means of darts, _rishtis_ and _tomaras_, suspended the\\n respiration of Hari even as the _prānāyāma_²⁷ doth that of a twice-born\\n one. On being sore tried by the night-rangers, like the great Ocean by\\n the fishes (residing in it), that invincible one, taking his _Sārnga_,\\n showered shafts among the Rākshasas. And with sharpened arrows\\n resembling the thunder, and endowed with the velocity of the wind, shot\\n from his bow drawn to its fullest stretch, Vishnu cut off (Rākshasas) by\\n hundreds and by thousands. And dashing away (the Rākshasa ranks) with\\n his arrowy shower, even as the wind aroused dasheth away a downpour,\\n that best of male beings blew his mighty conch—Pānchajanya. And winded\\n by Hari with his utmost might, that water-sprung king of conchs, endowed\\n with terrific blares, roared, as if afflicting the three worlds. And the\\n sounds of that king of conchs struck terror into the Rākshasas, even as\\n in a mighty forest a lion (strikes terror into the hearts of) elephants\\n in rut. And thereat the horses could not keep their ground, and the\\n elephants were reft of their temporal flow, and shorn of their virtue at\\n the roars of the conch, heroes began to topple down from their cars. And\\n dight with dainty feathered parts having heads, the shafts discharged\\n from the _Sārnga_, resembling thunder-bolts, riving those Rakshas,\\n entered the earth. And in that conflict, pierced by the arrows\\n discharged from Nārāyana’s arm, the Rākshasas began to drop to the\\n ground like mountains struck with the thunder-bolt. And the wounds on\\n the persons of the foes inflicted by the discus of Vishnu discharge\\n blood in streams, like mountains discharging streams of red chalk. And\\n the sounds of that king of conchs, as well as those of the _Sārnga_,\\n combined with the roars emitted by Vishnu himself, swallowed up the\\n roars of the Rākshasas. And Hari by means of his shafts cut off their\\n necks, and arrows, and standards, and bows, and cars, and ensigns, and\\n quivers. And like fierce rays streaming about from the sun, like\\n torrents dashing from the ocean, like elephants coming down a mountain,\\n or like showers descending from clouds, the shafts shot by Nārāyana\\n pursue (the foes) by hundreds and by thousands.

Then, having despatched thousands of Rākshasas, the destroyer of\\n Madhu blew his water-sprung (conch), even as the sovereign of the\\n celestials filleth clouds (with rain). And agitated by the arrows of\\n Nārāyana, with their senses bewildered by the blares of the conch, the\\n broken Rākshasa forces made for Lankā. And on the Rākshasa army having\\n been broken in consequence of the beating it got at the hands of\\n Nārāyana, Sumāli with showers of shafts resisted Hari in the encounter;\\n and as a mist envelopes the Sun, he enveloped him (with his arrows).\\n Thereat, the Rākshasas again summoned up their fortitude. And fired with\\n rage, that Rākshasa, inflated with insolence on account of his strength,\\n setting up a tremendous roar, darted at his antagonist in the conflict,\\n thereby seeming to revive the Rākshasas. And as an elephant flourishes\\n its trunk, that Rākshasa, lifting up his arm adorned with ornaments,\\n began to roar from rapture, like a mass of clouds lighted up with\\n lightning. And (Vishnu) cut off the head flaming with ear-rings of the\\n charioteer of the shouting Sumāli; and thereat the horses of that\\n Rākshasa aimlessly strayed hither and thither. And with his bewildered\\n steeds Sumāli wanders like a person deprived of patience, whose senses\\n are under a hallucination. And on Sumāli’s car being drawn at random by\\n his steeds, Māli, taking his bow and equipped therewith, darted at\\n Vishnu’s car and assailed that mighty-armed one as he was descending on\\n the field of fight. And like birds entering the Krauncha,²⁸ the arrows\\n discharged from Māli’s bow, graced with gold, hit Hari and entered (into\\n his body). And thereat, as a person holding his senses under subjection\\n is not thrown out of his mental balance, Vishnu, assailed in that\\n encounter with thousands of arrows shot by Māli, was not disturbed ever\\n so little. And then that creator of all beings, the reverend\\n Gadādhara,²⁹ twanging his bow-string, showered vollies of shafts on\\n Māli. And getting at Māli’s body, the arrows furnished with the\\n luminousness of lightning, drink his blood, like unto serpents drinking\\n nectar. And baffling Māli, the holder of the conch, discus, and mace,\\n brought down Māli’s crown, standard, bow and steeds. And then that\\n foremost of night-rangers, on being deprived of his car, sprang forward,\\n mace in hand, even as a lion bounds up from the brow of a hillock. And\\n he with his mace smote at the forehead of that lord of birds, even as\\n the Destroyer had smitten Içāna,³⁰ or as Indra smiteth a mountain with\\n his thunder-bolt. On being severely struck by Māli with his mace,\\n Garuda, writhing in torments, moved the god away from the field of\\n battle. On the god having been removed from the field by Māli as well as\\n Garuda, there arose a mighty din of Rakshas roaring (in chorus). And\\n hearing the cheers of the Rakshas, Indra’s younger brother, the reverend\\n Hari, sitting awry on that lord of birds, albeit moved off from the\\n scene of conflict, waxing enraged, from a desire of slaying (Māli)\\n hurled his disc at him. And thereat the disc, possessed of the splendour\\n of the solar disc, and resembling the wheel³¹ itself of Kāla, flooding\\n all the heavens with radiance, brought down Māli’s head to the ground.\\n And that head of the lord of Rākshasas, terrific to behold, on being cut\\n off (by Vishnu), vomitting blood, fell down before (the Rākshasas), as\\n formerly Rāhu’s head’ had fallen. And then the deities experiencing\\n excess of joy set up leonine cheers with might and main,\\n crying,—’Excellent, O god.’ Seeing Māli slain, Sumāli and Malyavān,\\n burning in grief, fled precipitately towards Lankā along with their\\n forces. And Garuda, being cheered, turned round, and growing enraged, as\\n before drove the Rākshasas with the wind of his wings. And (some) with\\n their lotus-faces cut by the discus, (some) with their chests crushed\\n with the mace, (some) with their necks torn off by the plough, (some)\\n with their heads riven by the club, and some hewn by the sword, and\\n others pierced by arrows, the Rākshasas began to drop fast from the sky\\n into the waters of the ocean. And as the thunder-bolt with lightning\\n (riveth) a mighty mass of clouds, Nārāyana by means of the thunder-bolts\\n of his arrows discharged from his bow, rived the night-rangers with\\n their hair dishevelled and streaming (in the wind). And the forces\\n having their umbrellas rent, their arms falling off, their goodly\\n garments scattered, their entrails coming out and their eyes\\n rolling,—became incapable of distinguishing their own party from that of\\n the foe. And even like (the roars and the vehemence) displayed by\\n elephants on being attacked by lions, the roars and the vehemence of the\\n night-rangers and their elephants, sore assailed by the Primaeval\\n Lion,³² were equal. And driven by Hari’s networks of arrows, and\\n discharging (all the while) their own showers of shafts, those\\n night-rangers resembling the clouds of doom, are driven like the\\n veritable clouds of the universal dissolution drifted by the wind. And\\n hewn in twain with swords, the foremost Rākshasas fell like unto hills\\n (toppling headlong). And the Earth was seen to be (covered) with\\n night-rangers resembling dark clouds, adorned with jewelled necklaces\\n and ear-rings,—falling down,—as if covered with dark mountains dropping\\n down.\"\\n \\n    ²⁷ The practice of regulating respiration and finally suspending the\\n       same.

And with\\n his eyes reddened, that night-ranger waxing wroth, shaking his head,\\n addressed that prime of male persons—Padmanābha,—saying,—’O Nārāyana,\\n thou art ignorant of the time-honored morality of Kshatriyas; and\\n therefore like a base wight thou slayest us, desisting from fight and\\n exercised with fear. O lord of the celestials, he that commits the crime\\n of slaying one that desists from fight, cannot go to the celestial\\n regions as the fruit of meritorious acts. If thou art bent upon battle,\\n O holder of the conch, the discus and the mace, taking up my post\\n (here), I shall see (thy strength). Do thou show (me) the same.’ Seeing\\n Mālyavān resembling the mountain, Mālyavān, stay, the powerful younger\\n brother of the sovereign of the celestials spoke unto him,—’I have\\n removed the fear of the deities, affrighted at you, by promising that I\\n will make root and branch work with the Rākshasas; and that same promise\\n I am now fulfilling. I should always lay down my life for serving the\\n celestials; and you I will slay even if ye should go to the nethermost\\n regions.’ As that god of gods having eyes resembling red lotuses was\\n speaking thus, the lord of Rākshasas in high wrath pierced his breast\\n with a dart. And hurled by the hand of Mālyavān, the dart resonant with\\n bells, appeared graceful on Hari’s breast like lightning embosomed in\\n clouds. Thereat drawing out the same dart, that one dear unto the\\n Wielder of the Dart,³⁴ having eyes resembling red lotuses, aiming at\\n Mālyavān, hurled it at him. Thereat the dart discharged by the hand of\\n Govinda like unto the Dart discharged by the hand of Skanda, rushing\\n towards the Rākshasa like a meteor coursing towards the Anjana mountain,\\n descended on the spacious chest of the lord of Rākshasas decked with the\\n weight of a chain, even as the thunder-clap bursts at the summit of a\\n mountain. And on having his mail rent, Mālyavān was utterly deprived of\\n his senses; but (anon) reposing for a while, he again stood like a\\n moveless hill. Then taking up a javelin made of black iron girt with\\n many a thorn, he furiously smote that deity on the chest. And that\\n night-ranger delighting in battle, dealing a box at Vāsava’s younger\\n brother, moved away to a distance measuring a bow’s length. And now\\n there arose a mighty tumult in the sky of ’Excellent!’ ’Excellent!’ And\\n having struck Vishnu, the Rākshasa also hit Garuda. Thereat Vinatā’s\\n son, growing enraged, drove the Rākshasas away with the wind of his\\n wings, even as a lusty wind bloweth about sere leaves. And seeing his\\n elder brother driven by the wind produced by the wing’s of that bird,\\n Sumāli along with his forces, made for Lankā. And pushed off by the\\n violence of the wind of (Garuda’s) wings, the Rākshasa Mālyavān also,\\n joined by his own forces, departed for Lankā, covered with shame. Thus,\\n O Rāma, O lotus-eyed one, (the Rākshasas) had innumerable warriors\\n beaten down and their foremost leaders slain. And albeit inflated with\\n pride, they, incapable of coping with Vishnu, leaving Lankā, went to the\\n nether regions with their wives for dwelling there. O best of the\\n Raghus, these Rākshasas of celebrated prowess, related to the race of\\n Sālakantankatā, remained under the leadership of the Rākshasa Sumāli.\\n All those exalted Rākshasas going under the name of Paulastya that had\\n been headed by Sumāli, Malyavān and Māli, were stronger than Rāvana. No\\n other than the god Nārāyana, holding the conch, the discus and the mace,\\n could slay those Rākshasas—foes to the celestials and thorns in the side\\n of the deities. And thou art that eternal god—the four armed\\n Nārāyana,—the lord, undeteriorating and unconquerable, sprung to\\n exterminate Rākshasas. The creator of beings—that one ever cherishing\\n those seeking his refuge—appeareth at times to compass the destruction\\n of marauders, bringing the religion of people to rack and ruin.³⁵ Thus,\\n O lord of men, to-day I have truly related unto thee at length the\\n origin of the Rākshasas. Again, foremost of the Raghus, do thou\\n understand the matchless birth and potency of Rāvana and his sons\\n related in detail.

       " 9: '## SECTION IX.\\n \\n \\n \"After a while the Rākshasa named Sumāli, coming up from the nether\\n regions, began to range all over the earth. And resembling dark clouds,\\n that lord of Rākshasas decked in ear-rings of burnished gold, taking his\\n daughter like unto Sree herself without her lotus, and wandering over\\n the earth, saw the lord of riches journeying in his Pushpaka, going to\\n see his sire—that lord, the son of Pulastya. And seeing that one\\n resembling an immortal and like unto fire, journeying on, (Sumāli)\\n struck with amazement, entered the nether regions from the earth. And\\n that mighty-minded one reflected thus,—’By adopting what measure may the\\n welfare of the Rākshasas be brought about, and how can we increase (in\\n power)?’ And that great-minded lord of Rākshasas, resembling dark\\n clouds, decked in burnished ear-rings of gold, then began to reflect.\\n And then the Raksha addressed his daughter, named Kaikasi, saying,—’O\\n daughter, the time hath come when I should give thee away. Thy youth is\\n about to be passed. (Kept back) by the fear of refusal, no suitor hath\\n sought thee (up to this time). But desirous of acquiring religious\\n merit, we are striving our best in thy interests. My daughter, thou art\\n furnished with every perfection like unto Sree herself. The being father\\n to a daughter is misery to every one that seeketh honor. O daughter, one\\n doth not know who shall ask for one’s daughter. Wherever may a daughter\\n be conferred, a daughter stayeth, placing in uncertainty the three\\n races³⁶ to which she is related. Do thou, my daughter, seek for thy\\n husband that best and foremost of ascetics sprung in the line of\\n Prajapati—Pulastya’s son,—Viçrava, and of thyself accept him (for thy\\n lord). And then, O daughter, even as is this lord of riches, so thou\\n wilt, without doubt, have sons resembling the Sun himself in energy.’\\n Hearing that speech of his, the daughter for the sake of the dignity of\\n her sire, going to where Viçrava was practising penances, stood there.\\n In the meanwhile, O Rāma, that twice-born one—Pulastya’s son—was\\n performing the Agnihotra, like the fourth Fire itself. And without\\n minding that terrific time, (Kaikasi), having regard to the dignity of\\n her sire, coming up before him, stood (there) hanging her head down\\n towards his feet and throwing up the earth with her great foe. And\\n seeing that one of shapely hips, having a face fair as the full Moon,\\n (that exceedingly high-minded ascetic) flaming in energy accosted her\\n thus,—’O gentle on, whose daughter art thou? And whence dost thou come\\n hither? And what is thy errand? And for whom (dost thou come)? O\\n beauteous (damsel), truly tell me this.’ Thus addressed, the girl, with\\n joined hands, said,—’O ascetic, thou art competent to get at my intent\\n by virtue of thy own power. Yet, O Brahmarshi, know me as having come\\n here at the mandate of my sire. My name is Kaikasi. The rest do thou\\n read thyself.’ And thereupon, the ascetic, entering into contemplation,\\n said these words,—’O gentle lady, I have learnt the purpose that is in\\n thy heart. O thou having the gait of a mad elephant, there reigns a\\n powerful desire in thee for having offspring. Inasmuch as thou hast come\\n to me at this fierce hour, hearken, thou amiable one, as to the kind of\\n offspring that thou shalt bring forth. Thou shalt, O thou of graceful\\n hips, bring forth terrible and grim-visaged Rākshasas delighting in\\n frightful friends, and of cruel deeds.’ Hearing his speech, she, bowing\\n down, said,—’O reverend (ascetic), such sons of terrific ways seek I not\\n from thee that followest the Veda. Therefore it behoveth thee to favor\\n me.’ On being thus besought by the girl, Viçrava—best of ascetics—again\\n addressed Kaikasi, like the full Moon addressing Rohini,³⁷—’O fair-faced\\n one, the son that thou bringest forth last, shall be like unto my\\n line,—he shall, without doubt—be righteous-souled.’ Having been thus\\n accosted, the girl, O Rāma, after a length of time brought forth a very\\n terrible and hideous offspring having the form of a Raksha,—having ten\\n necks, furnished with large teeth, and resembling a heap of collyrium,\\n with coppery lips, twenty arms, huge faces, and flaming hair. On his\\n having been born, jackals with flaming mouths and other ferocious beasts\\n began to gyrate on the left. And that god showered down blood; and the\\n clouds uttered forth harsh sounds. And the Sun was deprived of his\\n splendour; and meteors began to dart to the earth. And the earth shook;\\n and the wind swept away violently. And that lord of streams—the ocean,\\n which was calm before, became agitated. And his sire resembling his\\n grand-father named him, (saying),—’As this one hath been born with ten\\n necks, he shall be called Ten-necked.’ After him was born Kumbhakarna\\n endowed with prodigious strength, than whose proportions there are none\\n other’s on earth. Then was born she that, having a frightful visage,\\n goeth under the name of Surpanakhā; the righteous Bibhishana is the\\n youngest son of Kaikasi. On that one endowed with great strength having\\n been born, blossoms were showered down from heaven; and celestial\\n kettle-drums were sounded in the heavenly regions. And then there arose\\n the sounds of ’Excellent!’ ’Excellent!’ And in that extensive forest\\n those exceedingly energetic ones—Kumbhakarna and the Ten-necked one grew\\n up,—and became the sources of anxiety to people. And Kumbhakarna,\\n maddened to the height, devouring mighty saints devoted to religion,\\n constantly ranged the triune world in a dissatisfied spirit. But the\\n righteous Bibhishana, ever intent on piety, dwelt there, studying the\\n Veda, restraining his fare, and controlling his senses. And it came to\\n pass that after a length of time the god, Vaiçravana—lord of riches—came\\n to see his sire, mounted on Pushpaka. Seeing him, the\\n Rākshasi—Kaikasi—flaming up in energy, coming to the Ten-necked one,\\n represented to him,—’O son, behold thy brother, Vaiçravana, enfolded in\\n effulgence; and, albeit of equal fraternity, behold thee in this plight!\\n Therefore, O Ten-necked one, O thou of measureless prowess, do thou so\\n strive that thou also, my son, may be like Vaiçravana himself. Hearing\\n that speech of his mother, the powerful Ten-necked one was wrought up\\n with exceeding great ill-will, and he vowed then,—’I truly promise unto\\n thee that I will be equal to my brother (in energy), or excel him in it.\\n Therefore do thou cast off this sorrow that is in thy heart.’ And\\n influenced by that passion, the Ten-necked one with his younger brother\\n began to perform rigid acts, with his mind fixed on asceticism. ’I must\\n through austerities have my wish,’ thus fixed and resolved, he for\\n compassing his end, came to the sacred asylum of Gokarna. And there the\\n Rākshasa of unrivalled prowess along with his younger brother carried on\\n austerities and thus gratified that lord—the great-father. And beings\\n gratified (with him), he conferred on him boons bringing on victory.\"\\n \\n    ³⁶ The races respectively of her father, mother and husband.\\n \\n    ³⁷ Hesperus.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 10: '## SECTION X.\\n \\n \\n Then Rāma spoke unto the ascetic,—\"O Brāhmana, how did those exceedingly\\n mighty brothers carry on austerities in that forest; and what kind of\\n penances were theirs?\" Thereat there Agastya said unto Rāma of a\\n complacent mind,—\"The brothers severally observed the morality proper to\\n each. And Kumbhakarna, putting forth his best energies, constantly abode\\n in the path of righteousness. And remaining in the midst of five fires\\n in summer, he practised austerities, and in the rainy season, soaked in\\n water (poured down) by clouds, he sat in the heroic attitude.³⁸ And in\\n winter he always remained in the water. Thus passed away ten thousand\\n years of that one putting forth exertions in behalf of religion, and\\n established in the path of honesty. And the virtuous Bibhishana, ever\\n intent on virtue and pure of spirit, remained standing on one leg for\\n five thousand years. And when he had completed (his term of\\n restriction), swarms of Apsarās danced, and blossoms showered, and the\\n deities hymned (him). And for five thousand years, he adored the Sun,\\n and with his mind concentrated in the study of the Veda, remained with\\n his head and hands raised up. In this wise Bibhishana like a deity in\\n Nandana passed away ten thousand years, observing restrictions. And the\\n Ten-necked one passed ten thousand years without fare. On a thousand\\n years being complete, he offered his own head as a sacrifice to Fire. In\\n this way he passed away nine thousand years; and nine of his heads\\n entered into Fire. And as in the tenth year he intended to strike off\\n his tenth head, the Great-father presented himself at that place. And\\n well-pleased, the Great-father came there along with the celestials. ’O\\n Ten-necked one,’ said (the Great-father), ’I am well-pleased with thee.\\n Do thou, O thou cognizant of righteousness, at once ask for the boon\\n that thou wishest to have. What wish of thine shall I realize? Thy toil\\n must not go for nothing.’ Thereat, the Ten-necked one, bowing down his\\n head unto the deity, said with a delighted heart,—his words faltering\\n with ecstacy,—’O Reverend one, creatures have no other fear than (that\\n of) death; and enemy there is none that is like unto death. Therefore\\n immortality is even what I crave for.’ Thus accosted, Brahmā spoke unto\\n the Ten-necked one,—Thou canst not be immortal. Do thou therefore ask of\\n me some other boon.’ Thus addressed by the creator, Brahmā, the\\n Ten-necked one, O Rāma, standing before him with joined hands, said,—’O\\n lord of creatures, I would, O eternal one, be incapable of being slain\\n by birds and serpents, Yakshas, Daityas, Dānavas and Rākshasas, and the\\n deities; for, O thou that art worshipped by the immortals, anxiety I\\n have none from any other beings. Indeed, I deem as straw creatures such\\n as men _etc._’ Thus accosted by the Raksha—the Ten-necked one—that\\n righteous-souled one, the Great-father, along with the celestials,\\n said,—’O foremost of Rākshasas, what thou sayest shall come to pass.’\\n Having, O Rāma, said this unto the Ten-necked one, the Great-father\\n (again spoke),—’Hear! I, having been gratified, will confer on thee a\\n fresh boon. O Rākshasa, O sinless one, those heads of thine which have\\n been offered as sacrifices and which have sunk into the fire, shall\\n again be thine. And, O placid one, I shall also confer on thee another\\n boon difficult of being obtained,—The form that thou shalt wish to wear,\\n shall instantly be thine. As soon as the Ten-necked Raksha had spoken\\n thus, the heads that had been offered as sacrifices into the fire, rose\\n up again. Having said this unto the Ten-necked one, the Great-sire of\\n all creatures addressed Bibhishana, saying,—’O Bibhishana, gratified\\n have I been by thee, whose intelligence is established in righteousness.\\n Therefore, my child, O righteous-souled one, O thou of excellent vows,\\n ask for the boon that thou wouldst have.’ Thereat the virtuous\\n Bibhishana spoke with joined hands,—’O reverend one, since the spiritual\\n preceptor of all creatures himself (is pleased) with me,—I (deem myself)\\n as furnished with every perfection, even as the Moon is environed with\\n rays. If thou wilt bestow on me a boon with pleasure, then, thou of\\n excellent vows, hear of the boon that I would have. May my mind remain\\n fast fixed on righteousness, even when I shall happen to fall into high\\n peril; and may I attain Brahmā knowledge without any instructions! And\\n may every sense of mine sprung during the observance of particular modes\\n of life, be in unison with righteousness,—so that I may practise the\\n form of religion (in harmony with any particular mode of life!) O\\n exceedingly noble one, this best of boons, is even what is sought for by\\n me, for nothing in this world is incapable of being attained by those\\n attached to righteousness.’ Then the lord of creatures, being again\\n delighted, spoke unto Bibhishana,—’As thou art virtuous, so all this\\n shall come to pass on thy behalf. And inasmuch as in spite of thy having\\n been born in the Rākshasa race, thy thoughts, O destroyer of enemies, do\\n not originate in sin, I confer on thee immortality.’ Having said this,\\n he intended to grant boons unto Kumbhakarna. Thereat the celestials in a\\n body represented to the lord of creatures with joined hands,—’On\\n Kumbhakarna thou shouldst confer no boons, since thou knowest in what\\n manner doth this wicked-minded one frighten people. And, O Brahman,\\n seven Apsarās in Nandana, ten attendants of Mahendra, as well as sages\\n and human beings, have been devoured by this one. Considering what this\\n Rākshasa did when he had not obtained any boon whatever, if he obtain\\n one now he shall eat up the three worlds. Do thou then, O lord having\\n immeasurable prowess, pretending to give him a boon, give stupifaction\\n (instead). Thereby the welfare of people would be secured, and the honor\\n of this one too shall be maintained.’ Thus addressed by the celestials,\\n Brahmā, the Lotus-sprung one, pondered. The goddess, Saraswati, who was\\n by his side was also agitated with anxiety. And remaining by him,\\n Saraswati with joined hands observed,—‘O god, I have come here. What\\n work shall I accomplish?’ And the lord of creatures, on having her,\\n spake unto ’Saraswati,—‘O Vāni!³⁹ be thou the goddess of speech of this\\n foremost of Rākshasas,⁴⁰ favorable unto the deities. Having said,—‘So be\\n it,’ she entered (within Kumbhakarna’s throat); and Prajāpati said,—‘O\\n Kumbhakarna, O mighty-armed one, do thou ask for the boon that thou\\n wouldst have. Hearing those words, Kumbhakarna said,—‘O god of gods, my\\n wish is that I may sleep for a good many years.’ Thereupon, saying,—‘So\\n be it,’ Brahmā along with the celestials went away; and the goddess,\\n Saraswati, also again left the Rākshasa. And on Brahmā accompanied by\\n the deities going to the celestial regions, he was renounced by\\n Saraswati, and then he regained his consciousness. And then the\\n wicked-minded Kumbhakarna sorrowfully thought,—‘What is this speech that\\n has to-day come out from my lips? Meseems I had then been stupified by\\n the deities that had come.’ Having thus obtained the boons, the brothers\\n endowed with flaming energy, going to the Sleshmātaka wood, began to\\n dwell there peacefully.\"\\n \\n    ³⁸ Hindu Yogis practise various attitudes, which are favorable to the\\n       regulation of respiration.—T.\\n \\n    ³⁹ Lit. word, a designation of Saraswati.\\n \\n    ⁴⁰ i.e. preside over Kumbhakarna’s speech while asking for the\\n       boon,—and let him, through thy power, ask for such a gift as may\\n       turn out profitable to the gods.—T.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",

And arriving at Trikuta, that one\\n skilled in speech—the night-ranger, Rāvana—sent Prahasta in the capacity\\n of an ambassador: ‘O Prahasta, hie thee; and tell the foremost of\\n Nairitas—the lord of riches—in my words informed with mildness,—This\\n city of Lankā, O king, belongs to the high-souled Rakshasas; but thou\\n hast established thyself in her.

Therefore, O thou of unrivalled prowess, if thou shouldst render\\n the same (back), I shall be highly gratified; and righteousness also\\n thou wilt maintain.—’ Thereupon, repairing to Lankā, well-protected by\\n the giver of riches, Prahasta communicated these words unto the highly\\n generous ruler of riches,—‘O thou of excellent vows, I have been sent to\\n thee by thy brother, the Ten-necked one, O long-armed one, O foremost of\\n those versed in all branches of learning, do thou listen to my words, O\\n lord of wealth,—and what the Ten-faced one says,—This beautiful city, O\\n thou furnished with expansive eyes, was formerly inhabited by Rākshasas\\n of dreadful prowess headed by Sumāli; and for that reason, O son of\\n Viçrava, he asks thee this. Do thou, my child, grant this unto him, who\\n is humbly begging for it.’—Hearing these words from Prahasta, the god\\n Vaiçravana, best of those skilled in speech, answered the former,\\n saying,—‘My father had given this unto me, when it had been emptied of\\n night-rangers; and, O Raksha, I have inhabited this place, furnished\\n with charity, honor, and other virtues. Go and tell the Ten-necked one,\\n as this city and this kingdom are mine, so they are thine, O\\n mighty-armed one. Do thou enjoy this kingdom without a foe.

The mighty-armed Ten-necked one had (once) spoken in my presence\\n (to that effect). Thereat I greatly rebuked that wicked-minded one; and\\n I said again and again in anger,—Thou disregardest (thy religion and\\n honor). Do thou listen to my words fraught with religion and profit. Of\\n a wicked heart, thou, with thy understanding spoilt in consequence of\\n the granting of the boon, canst not distinguish between those deserving\\n honor and those not; and, further, through my curse, thou hast come by a\\n fierce nature. Therefore, O mighty-armed one, go to the mountain,\\n Kailaça. Do thou, along with thy retainers, for the purpose of dwelling\\n there, take up thy quarters (there). There floweth the Mandākini—best of\\n streams, with her water covered with golden lotuses resembling suns, as\\n also with lilies and blue lotuses and various other fragrant flowers.\\n And coming there frequently, celestials with Gandharvas and Apsarās and\\n serpents and Kinnaras, ever sport there, O lord of riches, thou ought\\n not to enter into hostilities with that Raksha. Thou knowest how he hath\\n obtained a great boon.’ Thus addressed, Viçravana, for the sake of his\\n father’s dignity, with his wives and sons, with his counsellors and his\\n vehicles and wealth went (to Kailaça). And Prahasta, going (back),\\n joyfully spoke unto the high-souled Ten-necked one, (seated) with his\\n counsellors and his younger brothers,—’The city of Lankā is (now) empty.\\n Renouncing her, the bestower of riches hath gone out of her. (Now)\\n entering into her, along with us, do thou there maintain thine own\\n religion.’ Thus addressed by Prahasta, the redoubtable Ten-necked one\\n entered the city of Lankā with his brothers and forces and followers.\\n And then even as the lord of the celestials ascends heaven, that foe of\\n the immortals ascended Lankā well-divided by highways,—which had been\\n forsaken by the lord of wealth. And having been installed, that\\n night-ranger—the Ten-faced one—dwelt in that city; and that city teemed\\n with night-rangers resembling dark clouds.

Then\\n that Rākshasa bestowed his sister, the Rākshasi Surpanakhā, on that lord\\n of the Dānavas and king of the Kālakas—Vidyujjibha. And having given her\\n away, the Raksha was wandering about for the purpose of hunting, when,\\n Rāma, he happened to see Diti’s son, named Maya. And seeing him\\n accompanied by his daughter, that night-ranger—the Ten-necked one—asked\\n him, saying,—’Who art thou that (wanderest) alone in this forest devoid\\n of men as well as deer? And art thou accompanied by this one having the\\n eyes of a young deer?’ Thereat Maya, O Rāma, answered that night-ranger,\\n when he had asked this,—’Listen. I shall tell thee all about this. Thou\\n mayst ere this have heard of an Apsarā named Hemā. She like unto the\\n Paulomi of Satakratu was bestowed on me by the gods. And I passed a\\n thousand years, being devoted to her. Thirteen years have passed away\\n since she had gone on a business of the celestials, as also the\\n fourteenth year. Then I through my extraordinary skill constructed a\\n golden palace, adorned with diamonds and lapises. There I dwelt,\\n aggrieved and sorrowful on account of her separation. From thence,\\n taking my daughter, I have come to this wood. This, O king, is my\\n daughter, grown in her womb. I have come hither with her, seeking for\\n her husband. Verily being father to a daughter is misery to every one\\n that seeketh one’s honour. A daughter, forsooth, stayeth, ever placing\\n the two lines⁴¹ in uncertainty. And on this wife of mine I have also\\n begat two sons;—the first is Māyāvi and the next Dundubhi. Thus have I\\n truly related everything unto thee that hadst asked for it. But, my\\n child, how can I know thee now? Who art thou?’ Thus addressed, the\\n Raksha humbly said,—Ten-necked by name, I am the son of the ascetic,\\n Paulastya, who was born as the third son of Brahmā.’ Thus accosted, O\\n Rāma, by that lord of Rākshasas, that Dānava and foremost of Dānavas,\\n Maya, learning that he was the son of the Maharshi, Paulastya, there\\n desired in his heart to give away his daughter to him.

And lighting a\\n fire, he took her hand. Maya, O Rāma, knew the curse of the sage\\n touching him.⁴² Knowing this, he gave away his daughter, having regard\\n to the race of Rāvana’s paternal grand-father; and he also conferred on\\n him an exceedingly wonderful dart acquired through the most rigid\\n austerities,—by which he wounded Lakshmana. Having thus wedded, that\\n master—Lankā’s lord—going (back) to that city, married his brothers. And\\n Rāvana married the grand-daughter of Virochana (on the maternal side)\\n named Vajrajwālā, to Kumbhakarna.—And Bibhishana obtained for his wife\\n the righteous (damsel) named Saramā—daughter unto the\\n high-souled—Sailusha—sovereign of the Gandharvas.

And while the lake, Mānasa, was swollen\\n with water on the arrival of the rains, her mother, hearing her cries,\\n affectionately said,—_Saromāvarddhata_—’O lake, do not swell,’ and from\\n this circumstance, her name became Saramā. Having thus wedded, those\\n Rākshasas, taking each his wife, set about sporting there, like unto\\n Gandharvas sporting in Nandana. And then was born Mandodari’s\\n son—Meghanāda. Him ye call Indrajit. As soon as he was born, Rāvana’s\\n son, formerly crying, emitted a tremendous roar resembling the rumbling\\n of clouds. And, O Rāghava, Lankā was petrified at his voice; and\\n (accordingly) his sire himself kept his name, Meghanāda.

Then I, going to another\\n spacious peak of the mountain, became engaged in silently observing a\\n mighty vow. On my term of restraint having been complete, that lord of\\n the gods—Maheçwara—with a gratified heart addressed me, saying,—O\\n righteous one, O thou of fair vows, I am well-pleased with this\\n asceticism of thine. I also had observed this vow; and thou also, O lord\\n of riches, hast done the same, A third person there is none that\\n practiseth such a vow.

And this thy left eye hath\\n been burnt through the energy of the goddess, and hath turned tawny in\\n consequence of having seen the grace of the goddess; so thy name shall\\n ever be Ekākshipingali.—Then at Sankara’s command I have obtained the\\n privilege of companionship (with him).

And no room\\n was left (in the sky) in consequence of its being thronged by hosts of\\n sages; and warriors, wounded and rushing for conflict, and (finally)\\n ascending heaven.⁴⁷ And finding the foremost Yakshas endowed with great\\n strength give way, the mighty-armed lord of riches dispatched (other)\\n Yakshas.

I have already obtained a boon, bestowing on me immunity from death\\n at the hands of gods, Gandharvas and Dānavas; and Rākshasas and Guyhakas\\n and Nagas; and others also that are of more than ordinary strength. Man\\n count I not O god: they, I deem, are insignificant. I have also, O\\n destroyer of Tripura, received a long lease of life from Brahmā. Now I\\n wish to pass the remainder of my days in peace: and do thou grant me a\\n weapon.’ Thus addressed by him, (Rāvana,) Sankara gave him an\\n exceedingly effulgent sword, famed as Chandrahasa; and the master of\\n spectres then also granted him peace for the rest of his life. And\\n making (the sword) over to him, Sambhu said,—’Thou must not disregard\\n this. If disregarded, it will for certain come (back) to me?’ Having\\n thus received his name from Maheçwara, Rāvana, saluting Mahadeva,\\n ascended Pushpaka. And then, O Rāma, Rāvana, began to go round the\\n earth. And opposed at places, by the heroic Kshatriyas endowed with\\n energy and irrepressible in fight, who refused submission, he\\n exterminated them along with their retainers; while other men of wisdom,\\n knowing the Raksha to be invincible, said unto the Rākshasa elated with\\n strength,—’We have been conquered?’\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",

And it came to pass that there he saw\\n a damsel wearing a dark deer-skin and matted locks, leading the life of\\n a saint, and flaming like a celestial. And seeing the girl observing\\n high vows, endowed with beauty, he, with his soul overwhelmed with lust\\n asked her, laughing, ’How is it, O amiable one that thou actest thus\\n contrary to thy youth? This course of life surely doth not befit thy\\n beauty. Thy loveliness, O timid one, is peerless, capable of maddening\\n folk with desire. It doth not behove thee to lead an ascetic mode of\\n life,—this would suit an old person. Whose daughter art thou, O gentle\\n lady? And what is this (vow) that thou practisest? And O fair faced\\n wrench, who is thy husband? He who hath thee for his wife, is, O\\n timorous one, hath religious merit on earth. Tell all about this to me\\n who ask for it. For whom dost thou put thyself to trouble?’ Thus\\n accosted by Rāvana, that illustrious girl, having asceticism for wealth,\\n having received him hospitably in due form, said, ’My sire is named\\n Kuçodwaja—a Brahmarshi of immeasurable energy, son unto Vrihaspati,\\n endowed with grace, and like unto Vrihaspati himself in intelligence.\\n And while that high-souled one was engaged in the daily study of the\\n Vedas, I was born as his word-impregnated daughter, named Vedavati. When\\n the gods and the Gandharvas and the Yakshas, Rākshasas, and Pannagas,\\n coming to my sire asked for me, O foremost of Rākshasas, my father did\\n not bestow me on any one of them. And I shall tell thee the reason\\n thereof; listen, O long-armed one. My father’s intended son-in-law was\\n even Vishnu—sovereign of the celestials, and the lord of the triune\\n world; and my father would not bestow me on any other. And hearing this,\\n a certain king of the Daityas, named Sumbhu—proud, of his prowess was\\n wrought up with wrath, and one night as my sire was on bed, that wicked\\n one slew him. Thereat my forlorn mother, of exalted righteousness,\\n embracing my father’s body entered into fire. Then wishing to realize my\\n father’s wish touching Nārāyana, I have fixed my heart even upon him.\\n Having made this promise, I have been carrying on rigid austerities.\\n Thus, O foremost of Rākshasas. I have related unto thee everything.\\n Nārāyana is my husband, and not any one else than that best of male\\n beings; and desirous of having Nārāyana I have adopted severe\\n restraints. I know thee, O king. Go thou O son of Paulastya. By virtue\\n of my asceticism I know all that takes place in these three regions.’\\n Thereat descending from the front of his car, Rāvana, afflicted with the\\n shafts of Kandarpa, again addressed that girl, observant of a mighty\\n vow, ’O thou of shapely hips, in as much as such is thy intent, thou\\n must be very proud. O thou having the eyes of a young antelope,\\n accumulation of religious merit suits old people. Thou, furnished with\\n every perfection, should not talk thus. Thou art the paragon in these\\n three worlds. Thy youth waxeth away. I am the lord of Lankā, O gentle\\n lady, known as Daçagriva. Be thou my wife, and enjoy pleasures according\\n to thy desire. Who is he whom thou callest Vishnu? O mild one, neither\\n in prowess, nor in asceticism, nor in enjoyment, nor in strength, is he\\n my equal, whom, O damsel, thou seekest.’ Thus accosted, Vedavati said\\n unto the night-ranger ’Do not say so’ in respect of Vishnu, lord of this\\n triune sphere, bowed down unto by all creatures. Save and except thee\\n alone, who, that is intelligent, crieth down (Nārāyana), O King of\\n Rākshasas.’ Thus addressed there by Vedavati, the night-ranger seized\\n the girl by the hair. Thereat Vedavati, wroth, cut off her hair with her\\n hand transformed into a sword. And then, flaming up in ire and as if\\n consuming the night-ranger, she, preparing a funeral pyre, hastened to\\n make away with herself. ’Thou abject, having been outraged by thee I\\n wish not to live. Therefore, O Raksha, I will enter into fire in thy\\n very presence. And as I have in this world been dishonored by thee thou\\n art nefarious. I shall again be born to compass thy destruction. It\\n lieth not in a female to slay a male intent on sin; and if I utter a\\n curse, it shall cost my asceticism. But if I have done anything, given\\n away any thing, offered oblations unto the fire, then I shall be the\\n chaste daughter of some virtuous person, albeit unborn of any female\\n vessel.’ Having delivered herself thus, she entered into the flaming\\n fire; and thereat a celestial shower of blossoms rained all around from\\n heaven. O Lord, this is she that hath been born as the daughter of king\\n Janaka,—thy wife, O mighty-armed one. Thou art the eternal Vishnu. The\\n enemy, endowed with the splendour of a hill, formerly that had been\\n slain through the wrath (of Vedavati), hath now been slain by her, by\\n help of thine superhuman prowess. And this one of eminent righteousnesss\\n would again spring up on earth like a flame from a field furrowed by the\\n plough. This one named Vedavati was born in the Krita age; and in the\\n Tretā age, for compassing the destruction of that Raksha, she was born\\n in the Maithila line of the high-souled Janaka.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 18: '## SECTION XVIII.\\n \\n \\n \"When Vedavati had entered into fire, Rāvana, ascending Pushpaka, began\\n to range the earth. And coming to Uçiraviga, Rāvana saw a king (named)\\n Marutta, sacrificing along with the deities. And a righteous Brahmarshi\\n named Samvartta, the very brother of Vrihashpati, officiated at the\\n sacrifice accompanied by the deities. And seeing that Raksha invincible\\n by reason of the boon he had received, the deities, apprehensive of\\n being worsted by him, assumed the forms of beasts. And Indra became a\\n peacock and the king of righteousness, a crow, and the bestower of\\n riches a lizard, and Varuna a swan; and, O slayer of foes, others also\\n became other beasts. And then Rāvana entered into that sacrifice like an\\n unclean dog. And then coming up to the king, Rāvana—lord of\\n Rākshasas—said: ’Give me battle, or say,—_I am defeated._’ Whereat king\\n Marutta asked, him—’Who art thou?’ And Rāvana laughing in contempt\\n said,—’O king, I am delighted, that lacking curiosity, thou dost not\\n dishonour Rāvana, younger brother unto the bestower of riches. What\\n other man is there in these three regions that knoweth not the might of\\n me, who, conquering my brother, has got possession of this car.’ Thereat\\n Marutta spoke unto Rāvana, saying,—’Blessed for sooth art thou, by whom\\n thy elder brother hath been vanquished in fight; and a person so\\n praiseworthy there is not in the three worlds. An act, that is divorced\\n from righteousness and that is reprehended by people, can never be\\n praiseworthy. Having committed a foul act, plumest thou upon thy having\\n vanquished thy brother? And practising what piety hadst thou a-fortune\\n received the boon? I had never before heard the like of what thou\\n sayest. But O perverse one, stay now. Living thou shalt not back. To-day\\n with my sharpened shafts shall I despatch thee to the abode of Yama.’\\n Then taking up his bow and arrows, that king of men went out for\\n encounter; but Samavartta stood in the way. And that great sage said\\n unto Marutta words informed with affection ’If thou hear my speech, thou\\n shouldst not fight. If this Maheçwara-sacrifice should remain\\n incomplete, it will burn up thy dynasty. Where is the fight of one\\n initiated in a sacrifice? And where is the passion of one initiated in a\\n sacrifice? And victory is ever uncertain; and the Rākshasa is difficult\\n to vanquish. And thereupon, the lord of Earth—Marutta—desisted in\\n consonance with the instructions of his spiritual preceptor; and\\n composed addressed himself to completing the sacrifice, giving up his\\n bow with the arrow set. And thereat considering him as defeated, Suka\\n proclaimed this all round; and from delight cried aloud, ’Victory unto\\n Rāvana!’ And then devouring the Maharshis that were present at the place\\n of sacrifice, Rāvana, satiated with their blood, again went to the\\n earth. On Rāvana having departed, the deities, inhabiting the etherial\\n regions—Indra etc.—assuming their proper forms, addressed those\\n creatures. And from joy Indra spoke unto the purple-plumed\\n peacock,—’Pleased am I with thee thou righteous one. No fear shall\\n spring to thee from serpents; and thy plumage shall be furnished with an\\n hundred eyes. And when I shall shower, thou shalt be filled with glee as\\n a token of my satisfaction with thee.’ Thus did Indra—chief of\\n celestials, confer a boon on the peacock. Formerly, O king, the\\n peacock’s wings had one unvaried blue. Having received the boon, the\\n peacock departed. Then O Rāma, the king of righteousness said unto the\\n crow, seated in front of the sacrificial apartment ’O bird, I am well\\n pleased with thee. Listen to my words as I utter them. As I have been\\n pleased with thee, thou shalt without doubt, enjoy immunity from the\\n various ailments to which the birds are subject. And O bird, from my\\n curse fear of death shall not approach thee; and thou shalt exist so\\n long as people do not slay thee. And those men residing in my dominion,\\n being smitten with hunger, shall be refreshed along with thy relations,\\n when thou hast eaten and been refreshed.’ Then Varuna addressed that\\n lord of birds the swan ranging the waters of the Gangā,—’Listen to my\\n words fraught with joy, thy hue shall be charming, mild, and like unto\\n the lunar disc; and it shall be beautiful, resembling the sheen of\\n spotless foam. And approaching my person thou shalt ever be beautiful to\\n behold; and thou shalt, as a sign of my gratification, attain\\n unparalleled complacence.’ Formerly, O Rāma, swans had not a hue of one\\n unvaried whiteness. Their wings ended in blue, and their breasts wore\\n the spotless hue of tender grass. And then Vaiçravana addressed the\\n chameleon as it was stationed at the mountain: ’Thy hue shall be\\n gold-gleaming. Pleased am I with thee. Thy undeteriorating head shall be\\n ever gold-hued. And this golden hue of thine shall proceed from my\\n gratification?’ Having thus conferred boons on them at that festal\\n place, the celestials, along with the king, (on the sacrifice) having\\n ended, went to their abode.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",

This I am resolved\\n upon. Otherewise there is no escape for you?’ Thereat those wise kings,\\n possessed of great strength, and ever abiding by righteousness, being\\n frightened (at Rāvana’s intimidation), took counsel of each other. And\\n knowing the superior strength of the foe, they said,—’We have been\\n defeated.’ Dushkanta, O child, and Suratha, and Gādhi, and Gaya and king\\n Pururavā—all these kings said: ’We have been defeated.’ And then\\n Rāvana—sovereign of the Rākshasas—presented himself before Ayodhyā,\\n governed by Anaranya, like Amarāvati ruled by Sakra.

At\\n once prepare for fight, and I also shall go and prepare myself.’ And\\n when he had heard everything (regarding Rāvana), the forces of that\\n foremost of kings that had been intended for conquering (Rāvana),\\n sallied forth ready for bringing about the destruction of the\\n Raksha,—ten thousand elephants, a _niyuta_ horse, and many thousands of\\n cars and infantry, O best of men; and, that host consisting of infantry\\n and cars, marched for encounter, covering up the earth. And then, O thou\\n proficient in fight, there took place a mighty and wonderful encounter\\n between king Anaranya and that lord of Rākshasas. And that host of the\\n king encountering the forces of Rāvana, were extinguished like unto\\n clarified butter thrown into the (sacrificial) fire. And having fought\\n valorously for a long time, the remnant of the royal forces, suddenly\\n coming in contact with the flaming Rākshasa ranks, were destroyed like\\n unto swarms of locusts entering into fire.

And then himself drawing his\\n bow resembling the bow itself of Sakra, that foremost of sovereigns,\\n beside himself with wrath, approached Rāvana. And brought down by\\n Anaranya, his (Rāvana’s) councillors—Māricha, Suka, and Sārana with\\n Prahasta,—took to their heels like unto dear. And then that son of the\\n Ikshwāku race discharged eight hundred arrows at Rāvana’s head. And like\\n unto showers pouring down on the top of a mountain, his shafts did not\\n inflict any wound (on Rāvana). And then the king, smitten on the head\\n with a slap by the enraged king of Rākshasas, dropped down from his car.\\n And the king, deprived of his senses, fell down on the earth, with his\\n body trembling all over; as falls in a forest a _sāla_ scathed with\\n heaven’s fire. And thereat the Raksha, laughing, spoke unto that\\n Ikshwāku, lord of the earth,—’What is this that thou hast gathered as\\n the fruit of thy encounter with me. O king, there is none in this triune\\n sphere that can combat with me. Having hitherto been sunk in lunacy thou\\n hast not heard of my strength.’ As he was speaking thus, the king, whose\\n sounds were fast running out said: ’What can I do in this matter. Verily\\n time is incapable of being controlled. I have been overcome by Time;\\n thou art merely an instrument. What can I do now, when I am going to\\n lose my life? I never turned away from fight; I have been slain\\n fighting. But, O Rākshasa, I shall tell thee something in consequence of\\n the disgrace that the Ikshwāku race has met with (to-day).

And in front (of his car)\\n stood death, equipped with _praças_ and maces in his hands, who makes\\n nothing of this entire triune world; incapable of deterioration. And\\n beside (him) was the rod of Time in its native from—the divine\\n instrument of Yama like unto a flaming fire on account of its own\\n energy. And then on beholding Time, infuriated, tending to strike terror\\n into all creatures, was agitated the triune universe, and trembling over\\n took the denizens of heaven. And the charioteer urged on the steeds\\n possessed of graceful splendour; and arrived where the lord of Rākshasas\\n was posted. And in a moment those horses like unto thought (in\\n celerity,) and resembling the steeds themselves of Hari, took Yama where\\n the warfare had already begun. And seeing the frightful car in that\\n aspect with Death present in it, the ministers of the Rākshasa monarch\\n at once took to their heels. And in consequence of their being\\n comparatively inferior in point of strength they were deprived of their\\n senses, and afflicted with fear; and saying, ’Here we are not equal to\\n fighting’ they went their way. But seeing that car capable of striking\\n terror into folks, the Ten-necked did not experience any agitation, nor\\n did fear enter his heart. And approaching Rāvana, Yama, enraged,\\n discharged spears and _tomaras_, and began to pierce Rāvana’s marrow.\\n But Rāvana, without at all feeling any smart, began to shower arrows on\\n Vaivaswata’s vehicle, resembling a downpour caused by clouds. And again\\n at his spacious breast, that Rākshasa who had undergone slender injury,\\n could not resist, (Yama’s arms) with hundreds of mighty darts hurled.\\n And in this way that destroyer of foes—Yama fought for seven nights with\\n various arms; until at length his enemy was driven back and deprived of\\n his senses. And then, O hero, there took place mighty onset between Yama\\n and the Rākshasa both eager for victory and both never tiring of fight.\\n And celestials and Gandharvas and Siddhas, and the supreme saints,\\n placing Prajapati at their head, presented themselves at the fight. And\\n the encounter that then took place between that foremost of of Rākshasas\\n and the lord of the Dead was like the universal upheaval. And stretching\\n his bow resembling in spleandour the thunderbolt of Indra, he discharged\\n arrows covering up the sky. And he smote Death with four, the (Yama’s)\\n charioteer with seven, and swiftly struck Yama in the marrow with\\n hundreds and thousands of shafts. And then from forth Yama’s mouth there\\n issued darted flames with his teeth mixed with smoke, the fire of his\\n fury. And witnessing this wonder in the presence of the deities and\\n Dānavas, both Death and Time were fired with wrath and were filled with\\n delight. And the Death, growing still more wroth, addressed Vaivaswata\\n saying;—’Let me go. I shall slay this sinful Rākshasa. Even this is my\\n native might this Rākshasa will be no more. Hiranyakaçipu, the graceful\\n Nemuchi, and Shamvara, Nishandi and Dhumaketu and Virochana’s offspring\\n Vāli, and the Daitya Shamvu that mighty monarchs, Vritra and Bāna; and\\n Kājarshis versed in all branches of learnings and Grandharvas, and\\n mighty serpents, and sages, and Pannagas and Yakshas, and swarms of\\n Apsarās and the Earth herself containing vasty oceans and mountains and\\n rivers and trees, at the unrolling of a Yuga—all these, O mighty monarch\\n have I brought to dissolution. All these and many more endowed with\\n strength and incapable of being overcome, were at the very sight of me\\n compassed with peril,—and what is this ranger of the night? Let me go. O\\n thou cognizant of righteousness,—I shall slay this one. There is none\\n that, albeit strong, can survive after having been seen by me. Verily\\n this is not mine strength,—this might pertaineth to me by nature. O\\n Time, if seen by me, he won’t live for a moment.’ Hearing these words of\\n his, the puissant king of righteousness spake there unto death,—’Do thou\\n stay. I myself shall slay him.’ Then with his eyes reddened that lord,\\n Vaivaswata, wielded with his hand the infallible dart of time; while by\\n him lay the redoubtable noose of time and the mace in its native shape\\n resembling fire and the thunderbolt. He, who by his very sight draweth\\n away the lives of creatures,—what should be said of its touching and\\n being hurled at people? And touched by that powerful one, that mighty\\n weapon, _engist_ with flames, attained access of energy, and seemed to\\n consume the Rākshasa. And in the field of battle, every one afflicted\\n with fear, ran away from it. And beholding Yama with his rod uplifted,\\n the celestials were agitated. And on Yama being desirous of slaying\\n Rāvana, the great-father manifesting himself spake unto Yama: ’O\\n Vaivaswata, O mighty-armed one, O thou of immeasurable prowess, this\\n certainly must not be; Thou shouldst not with thy rod slay the\\n night-ranger; for, O foremost of celestials, I have conferred a boon on\\n him; and thou shouldst not render false the words that I have uttered.\\n Verily he, that, whether a god or a human being, shall falsify my words,\\n shall render this triune universe false. There is no doubt about this.\\n If this terrific weapon, capable of affrighting the three spheres, be\\n discharged alike at friends and foes, it will destroy creatures. This\\n rod of time, of immeasurable might and incapable of being resisted by\\n creatures, was created by me as having the power of compassing the death\\n of all beings. Therefore, O mild one, thou forsooth shouldst not bring\\n it down on Rāvana’s head. If this alights on any one, he doth not live\\n for a moment, Whether on this weapon allighting, the ten-necked does not\\n die, or if he does do either way falsehood is the consequence, therefore\\n do thou keep thy uplifted weapon off Lankā’s lord. If thou have any care\\n for these worlds do thou establish my truth.’ Thus addressed, Yama then\\n answered, ’I restrain this rod. Thou art our Lord. But as I can not slay\\n this one who hath obtained a boon, what then shall I do now in the\\n field? Therefore shall I disappear from the sight of this Raksha.’\\n Having said this, even there did he vanish with his car and horses. And\\n having vanquished him and distinguished his name, he again ascended his\\n Pushpaka and went out of the abode of Yama. And with a delighted heart\\n Vaivaswata along with the deities headed by Brahmā—as well as that\\n mighty ascetic-Nārada, went to the celestial regions.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",

And seeing Rāvana, with his person bathed\\n in blood, bettered by the weapon discharged at him, they were seized\\n with surprise. And hailing him with victory, the councillors headed by\\n Māricha, having been encouraged by Rāvana, ascended Pushpaka. And then\\n the Raksha entered the region of waters—the abode of Daityas and\\n serpents, well protected by Varuna. And arriving at Bhogavati—the city\\n governed by Vāsuki, he brought the serpents under subjection and then,\\n delighted, bent his course to the palace—Manimayi. There dwelt the\\n Nivatakavachas, who had obtained boons. Those Daityas were possessed of\\n prowess and endowed with strength,—carrying various weapons, breathing\\n high spirits and invincible in battle. And the Dānavas and Rākshasas\\n growing enraged fell to raving each other with darts and tridents,\\n Kuliças and axes and _pattiças_. And as they fought one entire year\\n passed away and neither side obtained victory or was worsted. And then\\n that way of the triune sphere, that God, the undeteriorating\\n Great-father, swiftly presented himself on the scene mounted on his\\n excellent car. And making the Nivatakavachas desist from battle the\\n ancient great-father spake in clear words—’Even the celestials and the\\n Asuras are not able to vanquish this Rāvana in battle; nor can the\\n Dānavas backed by the gods can destroy you. Do you therefore turn your\\n minds to making friends with the Rākshasa. All interests are forsooth\\n the common possession of friends.’ Thereat Rāvana made friends with the\\n Nivatakavachas in the presence of Fire; and then rejoiced greatly. And\\n duly honored (by them) Daçānana passed there a year, without any feeling\\n of that place being different from his own home: and spent his time\\n agreeably. And having learnt there an hundred sorts of illusion, he\\n directed his course to Rasatala, searching for the city of the lord of\\n waters. And then going to the city named Açma ruled by the Kalakayas,\\n (Rāvana) slew the Kalakayas endowed with terrific strength; and then\\n with his sword cut off his brother-in-law,⁵⁹ the husband of Surpanakhā,\\n the mighty Vidyutjibha possessed of terrific strength; as that Rākshasa\\n in the encounter was licking (the limbs of Rāvana’s followers).⁶⁰ Having\\n vanquished him, he, in a moment, destroyed four hundred Daityas. And\\n then the lord of Rākshasas saw the grand abode of Varuna resembling a\\n mass of white clouds, and effulgent like unto Kailāça itself;—and also\\n saw the milk-conserving Surabhi stationed there; from the streams of\\n whose milk was produced the ocean named Kshiroda.⁶¹ And there Rāvana saw\\n the mother of kine and the foremost of bulls; from whom springeth that\\n maker of night the mild-beaming-moon; taking refuge under whom subsist\\n the prime saints and those living on froth, the froth⁶² (of milk); and\\n wherefrom sprang ambrosia as well as the Swadha of Swādhā-subsisting\\n ones,⁶³ even her that goeth with human beings under the name of Surabhi.\\n Having gone round this wonderful (cow), Rāvana entered the exceedingly\\n dreadful abode of Varuna guarded by various kinds of forces. And then he\\n beheld Varuna’s splendid mansion, streaming with hundreds of torrents,\\n resembling a mass of autumnal clouds, and always wearing a delightful\\n aspect. And killing the generals of the forces, after having been\\n resisted by them, he addressed the warriors, saying,—’Do you speedily\\n acquaint your king with this. Rāvana hath come here seeking battle. Do\\n thou give him fight, or say with joined hands, \"I have been defeated by\\n thee,\" and then thou hast no fear whatever.’ In the meantime the sons\\n and grandsons of the high-souled Varuna, as well as those of Pushkara\\n issued forth. And they, endowed with every virtue, accompanied by their\\n own forces, yoked cars furnished with the effulgence of the rising Sun,\\n and coursing at the desire of their riders. And then there took place a\\n mighty encounter capable of making people’s down stand on end, between\\n the sons of the lord of waters, and those of the intelligent Rāvana. And\\n in a short while that entire host of Varuna was brought down by the\\n highly powerful councillor of that Rākshasa Daçagriva. And seeing their\\n own forces brought to straits in the conflict and driven back in the\\n fight with networks of shafts, and down on the ground and seeing Rāvana\\n in Pushpaka, Varuna’s sons swiftly shot into the welkin with their\\n fleet-footing cars. And after they had attained a station of equal\\n vantage (with Rāvana) in the sky,⁶⁴ great was the encounter that then\\n took place in the sky, resembling the encounter of the deities and the\\n Dānavas. And turning away Rāvana in the conflict by means of shafts\\n resembling fire, they, exceedingly rejoiced, emitted various shouts. And\\n then Mahodara, enraged on seeing the king sore pressed, casting off\\n fear, and wrought up with rage, began to go around, eager for fight. And\\n smit with his mace by Mahodara, Varuna’s sons coursing at will and\\n resembling the wind (in velocity), dropped down to the ground. And\\n having slain those warriors and also those horses of Varuna’s sons\\n (Mahodara) seeing them lying down deprived of their cars swiftly sent up\\n a tremendous cheer. And destroyed by Mahodara, their cars and horses\\n together with their foremost charioteers, lay low on the earth. And then\\n forsaking their cars, the sons of the high-souled Varuna, stationed in\\n the sky, did not experience any pain⁶⁵ by virtue of their native power.\\n And having stretched their bows they pierced Mahodara, and then, all\\n together they greatly angered prevented Rāvana. As the clouds, with a\\n thousand torrents cleave a mountain, so they, with dreadful shafts,\\n resembling thunderbolts and discharged off the bows, pierced him.\\n Thereupon the Ten-necked (demon), excited with wrath like the fire of\\n dessolution, pierced them to their very vitals with highly dreadful\\n arrows. And stationed above, he showered on them variegated maces,\\n _Vallās_,⁶⁶ _Pātticas_, _saktis_ and huge _Sataghnis_.\\n \\n \"Thereupon with the arrows the infantry were greatly exhausted like unto\\n young elephants six years old, fallen in mire. Beholding Varuna’s sons\\n thus worn out and overwhelmed the highly powerful Rāvana roared in\\n delight like unto clouds. Thereupon emitting loud cries the Rākshaha,\\n like unto a cloud, with a downpour of diverse shafts, destroyed the\\n offspring of Varuna. Thereupon they were all defeated and fell dead on\\n the ground and all their followers fled away from the field of battle to\\n their homes. Rāvana spoke unto them.—’Do ye communicate this to Varuna.’\\n Whereto his minister Prahasta replied unto Rāvana saying—’O great\\n king—Varuna’s sons are slain and the lord of waters, whom thou art\\n inviting for battle, hath gone to the region of Brahmā, to hear songs.\\n While the king is away, what is the use of taking trouble, O hero? And\\n all these heroic sons (of Varuna) have been vanquished.’ Hearing these\\n words and spreading his own name the lord of Rākshasas expressing sign\\n of joy, issued out of Varuna’s abode.

       " 24: '## SECTION XXIV.\\n \\n \\n \"And again journeyed in the city of Açma (the followers of Rāvana)\\n dreadful in fight. There the Ten-necked demon beheld a highly\\n picturesque house—adorned with networks of pearls, having gateways\\n crested with Vaidurjas, golden pillars and abounding in pavements. And\\n the stairs, of that picturesque house resembling the abode of Mahendra,\\n covered with girdles, were made of crystal. Beholding that excellent\\n boost the highly powerful Rāvana thought within himself—’Whose is this\\n beautiful house, resembling the summit of Meru? Go O Prahasta, and learn\\n quickly whose house is this.’ Thus ordered, Prahasta entered that\\n excellent house—and finding none in one appartment he entered another\\n and thus entering seven apartments he at last saw a flame of fire. There\\n was a man in that flame, who, when seen, laughed aloud. Hearing that\\n dreadful laughter Prahasta’s down stood on their end. There was another\\n man in that flame, as if in a swoon, engarlanded with golden lotuses,\\n incapable of being looked at, like the sun, and resembling the Yama’s\\n self. Beholding that the night-ranger speedily issued out of the house\\n and communicated it unto Rāvana. Thereupon, O Rāma, having descended\\n from Pushpaka, the Ten-necked demon, black as collyrium, entered that\\n house. (Immediately) obstructing the door there stood a huge-bodied man,\\n dreadful like Siva—his tongue was all flame, his eyes were red, rows of\\n teeth beautiful, lips like _Bimba_, his form was handsome, nose\\n dreadful, neck like a shell marked with three lines, jaws were spacious,\\n beards thick, bone fleshy, teeth huge and his appearance was all\\n dreadful. And taking up an iron mace he stood at the gate. Beholding\\n him, Daçānana’s hairs stood on their end—his heart and body trembled.\\n And seeing these bad omens, O Rāma, he began to think within himself. He\\n thus meditating that man said—’What art thou thinking, O Rākshasa? Tell\\n me all in confidence. I shall confer upon thee the hospitality of\\n fighting, O hero, O night-ranger.’ Having said this he again spoke unto\\n Rāvana, saying—’Dost thou wish to enter into conflict with Bali, or what\\n else is thy intention?’ Rāvana was so overwhelmed that his hairs stood\\n on their end; but resorting to calmness he said—’O thou foremost of\\n those skilled in speech, who residest in this house? I shall fight with\\n him; speak out what thou wishest.’ He again said (to Rāvana)—’The lord\\n of Dānavas lives here—he is highly generous, heroic, and hath truth for\\n his prowess. He is gifted with many qualities, resplendent like unto\\n Yama with mace in his hand or the newly risen sun and incapable of being\\n defeated in conflict, impetuous, invincible, victorious, powerful, a\\n veritable ocean of accomplishments, sweet-speeched, supporter of the\\n dependants, fond of preceptor and Brahmans, always waiting for opportune\\n hours, gifted with high powers, truthful, of a handsome person, skilful,\\n gifted with all accomplishments, heroic and engaged in the study of the\\n Vedas. He sometimes walks on foot and moves about like the wind—he\\n shines like fire and spreads heat like the sun. He travels with the\\n gods, spirits, serpents and birds. He does not know fear; dost thou wish\\n to fight with him? If thou dost wish to fight with Bali, O lord of\\n Rākshasas, O thou gifted with great energy, do thou speedily enter (this\\n house) and engage in the encounter.’ Being thus addressed the Ten-necked\\n demon entered where Bali was. Beholding the lord of Lankā, the foremost\\n of Dānavas, resembling the flaming fire, and hard to look at like the\\n sun, laughed. And taking that Rākshasa by the hand and placing him on\\n his lap he said. ’O Ten-necked lord of Rākshasas, O thou having long\\n arms, what desire of thine may I satisfy? Do thou tell me what for thou\\n hast come hither.’ Being thus addressed by Bali Rāvana said—’I have\\n heard, O illustrious sir, that formerly thou wast bound by Vishnu.\\n Forsooth I am capable of releasing thee from the bonds.’ Hearing that\\n Bali laughed and said—’Hear, I shall relate to thee what thou hast\\n asked, O Rāvana. The red-hued man, who stands always at the door—by him\\n formerly all the leading Dānavas and other powerful lords were brought\\n into subjection—by him I was also bound. He is invincible like unto\\n death; who is there on this earth that can deceive him? He, who stands\\n at the door, is the destroyer of all beings, creator and preserver and\\n the lord of the three worlds. Thou dost not know him nor do I. He is\\n identical with past, future and present and is the lord. He is Kali and\\n he is Time—the destroyer of all beings. He is the destroyer and the\\n creator of the three worlds—and he slays all beings mobile and immobile.\\n And that lord of all gods again creates the universe without beginning\\n or end. O night-ranger, he governs and preserves all sacrifices, gifts\\n and oblations to fire. Forsooth he is the creator and the preserver of\\n the universe—there is none so wonderful in the three worlds. O son of\\n Pulasta, He hath been guiding the former Dānavas, myself, yourself like\\n so many beasts bound with ropes. Vitra, Danu, Suka, Sambhu, Nishumbha,\\n Sumbha, Kālanemi, Prahlada and others, Kuta, Vairochana, Mridu, Jamala,\\n Arjuna, Kansa, Kaitabha, and Madhu used to impart heat like the sun,\\n appear resplendant like the rays, move about like air and pour showers\\n like Indra. All of them celebrated many a sacrifice and were engaged in\\n austere penances. All of them were high-souled and considered the\\n practice of Yoga as a great virtue. Having got by an immense accession\\n of wealth they enjoyed many pleasures, made many gifts, celebrated many\\n sacrifices, studied (many lores) and governed their subjects. They were\\n all protectors of their own kith and kin and slayers of enemies; and in\\n battle, there was none equal to them in the three worlds. They were all\\n heroic, of a high pedigree, versed in all sacred writings, proficient in\\n all branches of learning and indomitable in warfare. Having defeated\\n thousands of celestials in conflict, the high-souled ones conquered the\\n regions. They were always engaged in those works which were not liked by\\n the celestials and used to maintain their own men. They were all\\n inflated with pride and haughtiness and effulgent like the newly-risen\\n sun. The glorious Hari, the lord Vishnu, knoweth only how to bring about\\n their destruction who perpetually assail the celestials. He creates all\\n these and He, bringing about their destruction, existeth in Himself at\\n the time of dissolution. These highly powerful and high-souled Danava\\n chiefs, assuming shapes at will, have been destroyed by the glorious\\n God. Besides, all these heroes, who have been heard of as being\\n irrepressible and invincible in warfare, have been discomfitted by the\\n wondrous power of Kritānta.’ Having said this the lord of Dānavas again\\n spoke unto the lord of Rākshsas—’O hero, O thou gifted with great\\n strength, take that flaming discus which thou beholdest and come to my\\n side. I shall then relate to thee the means of eternal liberation. Do\\n what I have told thee, O thou having long arms. Delay not Rāvana.’\\n Hearing this the highly powerful Raksha proceeded, laughing, O\\n descendant of Raghu, where that celestial _kundala_ was. Rāvana, proud\\n of his prowess, easily took it up but could not move it by any means.\\n And being ashamed that highly powerful one again attempted. As soon as\\n it was uplifted the Rākshasa dropped down on ground, bathed in a pool of\\n blood, like unto an uprooted Sāla tree. In the meantime there arose a\\n sound from Pushpaka, and the councillors of that lord of Rākshasas cried\\n aloud. Regaining his sense that Raksha rose up in a moment and lowered\\n his head in shame. Bali said to him—’Do thou come, O foremost of\\n Rākshasas and hear my words. O hero, the _kundala_, crested with jewels,\\n which thou didst assay to take up, is an ornament for the ear of one of\\n my forefathers. This fell here on the ground, O thou gifted with great\\n strength; another _kundala_ was thrown on the summit of the mountain.\\n Besides these _kundalas_ his crown was also cast off on the ground\\n before the altar during the encounter. Formerly none bore enmity towards\\n my ancestor Hiranya Kasipu—Time death, or illness. He had no death\\n during the day, night, evening or morning. O foremost of Rākshasas, he\\n did not experience death from any weapon whatsoever. He created a\\n dreadful enmity with Prahlada. This conflict having taken place with the\\n high-souled and heroic Prahlada there rose up a dreadful figure of\\n man-lion—a terror unto all, O foremost of Rākshasas. And that terrible\\n figure casting his looks about, all the worlds were over-whelmed.\\n \\n \"’Thereupon taking him up with his arms he destroyed him with his nails.\\n The person, who is standing at the door, is this supreme Yasudeva, void\\n of passion. I shall now relate to thee the words of that supreme God; do\\n thou hear, if thy heart is filled with spiritual thoughts. The person,\\n who is standing at the door, hath brought into subjection, in thousands\\n of years, a thousand of Indras, an Ayuta of gods and hundreds of great\\n Rishis.’ Hearing these words Rāvana said—’(I have seen) Kritānta, the\\n lord of spirits with Death himself, with hairs standing erect. Serpents\\n and scorpions are his hairs—his tongue is hard as the lightning, his\\n teeth are dreadful—his eyes are red and he is gifted with great velocity\\n and a terror unto all beings. He is incapable of being looked at like\\n unto the sun, unconquerable in battle and is the chastiser of the\\n sinners. He even was defeated by me in conflict. There I did not feel\\n the least pain or fear, O lord of Dānavas. I do not know (this\\n person)—it behoveth thee to give me an account.’\\n \\n \"Hearing the words of Rāvana Bali said—’He is the lord Hari—Nārāyana—the\\n protector of the three worlds. He is Ananta,⁶⁷ Kapila,⁶⁸ Jishnu,⁶⁹ and\\n the highly effulgent Man-lion.⁷⁰ He is Kratudhāma,⁷¹ Sudhāma,⁷² and hath\\n the dreadful mace in his hand. He is like unto the twelve Adityas,\\n Purana and the excellent Purusha; he is like unto the red clouds—the\\n lord of gods and the best god. O thou having long arms, he is encircled\\n by flames, a great devotee and fond of devotees; this lord preserveth\\n the universe and hath created it. And he, gifted with great strength,\\n brought about destruction in the form of Time; and this Hari, with a\\n discus in his hand, is sacrifice and is being worshipped in sacrifices.\\n He is at one with all gods—all beings, all worlds and all knowledge. He\\n is all forms, the great form, Baladeva and hath long arms; he slayeth\\n heroes, hath heroic eyes, is imperishable and the preceptor of the three\\n worlds. All these sages, who long for final liberation, meditate upon\\n him—he, who can know this Purusha, is not sullied with sins. By\\n remembering him, hearing of him and worshipping him, every thing can be\\n obtained.’ Hearing these words of Bali, the highly powerful Rāvana,\\n having his eyes reddened with ire, issued out with uplifted weapon.\\n Beholding him thus excited, the lord Hari, with a club in his hand,\\n thought within himself, O Rāma, ’I shall not slay this sinner for the\\n satisfaction of Brahmā’ and assuming his own shape disappeared.

Does he not perceive his object\\n of fear?’ Being thus addressed by Rāvana, Parvata said—’O my child, O\\n thou gifted with great intellect—Hear I shall describe to thee the\\n truth. By him all the worlds have been conquered and Brahmā hath been\\n propitiated And he is now proceeding to that excellent region full of\\n bliss for obtaining final liberation. As all the worlds have been\\n conquered by thee by virtue of thy asceticism, O lord of Rākshasas, so\\n is he going, undoubtedly performing many pious actions and drinking Soma\\n juice. O foremost of Rākshasas, thou art heroic, and hast truth for thy\\n prowess. The powerful are never offended with the pious.’ Thereupon he\\n espied an excellent, huge car, filled with all radiance and effulgence\\n and the sound of musical instruments and singing. (And Rāvana said)—’O\\n great Rishi, who is that person, gifted with great effulgence, who goeth\\n surrounded by charming songsters, dancing-girls and Kinnaras?’ Hearing\\n his words Parvata, the foremost of saints, again said—’He is heroic and\\n a great warrior—he never returneth unsuccessful from a battle-field.\\n Having performed many heroic feats in battle, and slain many enemies, he\\n hath been assailed with many wounds in fighting and hath renounced his\\n life for his master. Having destroyed many in battle, he hath at last\\n been slain by his enemies and is perhaps now going either to the region\\n of Indra or to some such place. This best of men is now being\\n entertained by these well-versed in the art of singing and dancing.’\\n \\n \"Rāvana again said—’Who goeth there effulgent like unto the sun?’\\n Hearing the words of Rāvana, Parvata said—’The person, resembling the\\n full moon and wearing diverse ornaments and cloths, whom thou beholdest,\\n O great king, in the golden car abounding in Apasaras, distributed gold.\\n He, gifted with great effulgence, is now going in a swift-coursing car.’\\n Hearing the words of Parvata, Rāvana said—’O foremost of Rishis, do thou\\n tell me, who, of these kings going, if prayed for, may offer me the\\n hospitality of a battle? For sooth thou art my father; do thou point out\\n (such a man to me) O thou conversant with piety.’ Being thus addressed,\\n Parvata again said to Rāvana—’O great king, all these kings wish for\\n heaven not for battle. I shall point out such a man, O great one, as\\n shall enter into conflict with thee. There is a highly powerful king—the\\n lord of seven islands, well known by the name of Māndhāta; he shall\\n enter into an encounter with thee.’ Hearing the words of Parvata, Rāvana\\n again said—’Do thou tell me, O thou of great devotion, where this king\\n resides. I shall go where lives this foremost of men.’ Hearing the words\\n of Rāvana, the sage again said—’The son of Yuvanaswha hath conquered the\\n world consisting of seven islands begining with the sea; Māndhāta, the\\n foremost of kings, is just coming to meet him.’ Thereupon (Rāvana)\\n having long arms, proud of the boon conferred upon him in the three\\n worlds, beheld the heroic Māndhāta, the lord of Ayodhyā and the foremost\\n of kings. The king of seven islands proceeded in a golden and\\n well-painted car resplendant like that of Mahendra, shining in his\\n beauty and sprinkled with celestial unguents. The Ten-necked demon said\\n to him—’Do thou give me battle.’ Being thus addressed, he, laughing,\\n said to the ten-necked demon—’If thy life is not dear unto thee, do thou\\n fight with me, O Rākshasa.’ Hearing the words of Māndhāta, Rāvana\\n said—’Rāvana did not experience any affliction from Varuna Kuvera or\\n Yama; why should he experience fear from thee, who art a man?’ Having\\n said this, the lord of Rākshasas as if burning in ire, ordered the\\n Rākshasas irrepressible in battle. Thereupon the ministers of the\\n vicious-souled Rāvana, highly enraged and well-skilled in warfare, began\\n to make a downpour of arrows. Thereupon the highly powerful king\\n Māndhāta, with sharpened shafts, assailed Prahasta, Suka, Sārana,\\n Mahodara, Birupaksha, Akampana and other foremost heroes. Prahasta\\n covered the king with his arrows—but before they had approached him,\\n that foremost of men shattered them into pieces. Like unto fire burning\\n down grass, the host of Rākshasas were burnt down by the king Māndhāta\\n by means of hundreds of _Bhushundis_, _Vallas_, _Vindipālās_ and\\n _Tomaras_. As Kartikeya, the son of fire, sundered the mount Krauncha\\n with his shafts so Māndhāta, enraged, pierced Prahasta with five\\n _Tomaras_ gifted with great velocity. Then hurling his mace again and\\n again resembling that of Yama, he struck, vehemently, Rāvana’s car\\n therewith. That club, resembling the lightning, vehemently descended\\n (upon Rāvana’s car) and Rāvana, like Sakra’s banner, was speedily upset\\n by that. Like unto the rising of the waters of the salt ocean on the\\n full moon, the king Māndhāta’s joy and strength were greatly increased.\\n Thereupon the entire Rākshasa host, emitting loud cries, stood\\n encircling on all sides the lord of Rākshasas. Thereat speedily\\n regaining his sense, Rāvana, a terror unto all people, the lord of\\n Lankā, greatly assailed the person of Māndhāta. And beholding that king\\n in a swoon, the highly powerful night-rangers were greatly delighted and\\n emitted leonine roars. Regaining his sense in a moment the king of\\n Ayodhyā beheld his enemy worshipped by the courtiers and night-rangers.\\n He was instantly worked up with ire; and assuming a person resplendant\\n like that of the sun and the moon he began to slay the Rākshasa host\\n with a dreadful downpour of shafts. With his arrows and the noise\\n thereof the entire Rākshasa army were overwhelmed like the agitated\\n deep. Thereupon there arose a dreadful conflict between men and demons.\\n And those two heroic, high-souled and foremost of men and Rākshasas\\n seated on warriors’ seats and holding bow and daggers entered (the\\n field). And possessed by great anger they began to assail one another\\n with shafts—Māndhāta Rāvana and he again the king. They, being assailed\\n by one another, were both wounded. And setting the Raudra shaft upon his\\n bow Rāvana discharged it and Māndhāta baffled it by means of his fiery\\n shafts. The Ten-necked demon took up the Gandharva weapon and the king\\n Māndhāta the Brahmā-weapon striking terror unto all. Rāvana then took up\\n the celestial Pāsupata weapon, dreadful and increasing the fright of the\\n three worlds, obtained by him from Rudra by virtue of his rigid\\n penances. Seeing this all animals, mobile and immobile, were stricken\\n with terror. Thereupon trembled all the three worlds consisting of\\n mobile and immobile beings—the celestials and all the serpents became\\n inert. Being apprised (of this conflict) by virtue of meditation the two\\n foremost of ascetics Pulastya and Gālava remonstrated with them in many\\n a way and prevented the king (Māndhāta) and the foremost of Rākshasas.\\n Thereupon that man and demon being reconciled with one another went back\\n by the ways they had respectively come.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",

       " 28: '## SECTION XXVIII.\\n \\n \\n \"Having conferred this boon upon Rāvana the father, sprung from lotus,\\n speedily returned to the region of Brahman. And having obtained the boon\\n Rāvana too came back. After a few days that Rākshasa Rāvana, the dread\\n of all people, arrived at the banks of the western Ocean with his\\n councillors. And on the island a person was seen bright as fire under\\n the name of Mahajambunada, seated there alone. He had a dreadful figure\\n and was like unto the fire at dissolution. And beholding that highly\\n powerful person amongst men like unto the chief of gods amongst the\\n celestials, the moon amongst the planets, the lion amongst the\\n Sarabhas,⁸⁰ the Airavata amongst the elephants, the Meru amongst the\\n mountains, and the Pārijāta amongst the trees, the ten-necked demon\\n said—’Give me battle.’ Thereat his eyes became agitated like unto\\n planets and from the clashing of his teeth there arose a sound like the\\n clapping of thunder-bolts. And the highly powerful Dasānana too roared\\n with his councillors. And with darts, _Saktis_, _Rishtis_ and _Patticas_\\n he again and again assailed that highly effulgent person, having long\\n arms, a dreadful appearance, huge teeth, a grim figure, a conch-like\\n neck, spacious breast, a belly like that of a frog, a countenance like\\n that of a lion, legs like the mount Kailāsa, red palms, red hands,\\n emitting dreadful roars, huge-bodied, gifted with the velocity of mind\\n and air, dreadful, carrying quiver, bells and chowries, encircled by a\\n burning flame and emitting a sweet note as a net-work of _Kinkini_ does,\\n having a garland of golden lotuses hung round his neck, appearing\\n graceful like unto the Rig-Veda, be-decked with lotus garlands,\\n resembling the Anjana and golden mountains. As the lion is not moved by\\n the attack of a wolf, the elephant by that of a bull, the Sumeru by the\\n king of serpents and the great Ocean by the current of a river, so that\\n great person was not agitated and said to the ten-necked demon—’O\\n vicious-minded night-ranger, I shall soon remove they desire for a\\n battle.’ O Rāma, the might of that person was a thousand times greater\\n than that of Rāvana which was dreadful unto all the worlds. Piety and\\n asceticism, which are at the root of attaining to every thing in the\\n world, are at his thighs; Cupid is his male organ, the Viswadevas are at\\n his waist and the Maruts are at the sides of his _Basti_; the Vasus are\\n in the middle portion of his body, the oceans are in his belly, the\\n quarters are on his sides, the Maruts are at his joints—the manes are\\n one his back and the grand-father has taken shelter in his heart; the\\n pious acts of making gifts of kine, gold and lands are his downs; the\\n mounts Himalaya, Hemkuta, Mandara, and Meru are his bones; the\\n thunder-bolt is his palm, the sky his body; the evening and watery\\n clouds are on his neck, the creator, the preserver and the Vidyadharas\\n are on his two arms. Ananta, Vasuki, Visalaksha Iravat, Kamvala,\\n Aswatara, Karkotaka, Dhananjaya the venomous Takshaka, and Upatakshaka,\\n have taken shelter under the nails of his hands, in order to vomit forth\\n their venom. The fire is in his mouth, the Rudras are on his shoulders,\\n the fortnights, months, years and seasons are on the rows of his teeth;\\n the lunar half and the dark half of the month are in his nostrils—and\\n the airy currents are in pores of his body. Saraswati, the goddess of\\n words, is his neck, the two Aswins are his ears, the sun and the moon\\n are his two eyes, O Rāma, all the divisions of the Vedas, Yagmas, the\\n whole host of stars, good words, energy, asceticism—all these are being\\n supported by his body, assuming the shape of a man. Thereupon that\\n Purusha easily struck Rāvana with his hands hard as thunder. Being\\n assailed thereby Rāvana immediately fell on the ground. Beholding that\\n Rākshasa fallen and having distressed others that huge person, like unto\\n the Rig-Veda, resembling a mountain and be-decked with lotus garlands,\\n entered the region under the earth. Rāvana addressed his councillors\\n thus—’O Prahasta, O Sukasārana and other ministers, where hath that\\n person suddenly gone? Do ye tell me this.’ Hearing those words of Rāvana\\n the night-rangers said—’That man, who crusheth down the pride of the\\n celestials and demons, hath entered hither.’\\n \\n \"As Garuda goes speedily taking a serpent so that vicious-minded Rāvana\\n arrived quickly at the entrance of the den. And Rāvana, having no fear,\\n entered therein. And having entered there he saw males resembling the\\n red collyrium, wearing _keyuras_,⁸¹ heroic, be-decked with red garlands,\\n pasted with red sandal and adorned with diverse golden ornaments and\\n jewels. He saw there three millions of such high-minded persons, devoid\\n of fear, pure, radiant like fire, dancing being mad after festivities.\\n Beholding them the Ten-necked demon, of dreadful prowess, was not the\\n least terrified, and rather saw their dance, standing at the gate. They\\n were all like the male being he had seen before. They were all of the\\n same colour, same dress, same figure and equally gifted with great\\n energy. They were all gifted with four arms and great energy. Beholding\\n them the down of the Ten-necked demon stood erect though a boon had been\\n conferred upon him by the Self-born and he speedily issued out of that\\n place. And he again saw another huge person lying down on a bed. His\\n house, seat and bed were all white and valuable and he was sleeping\\n enveloped by fire. And there sat gracefully with a fan in her lotus\\n hands, the goddess Laksmi—most beautiful in the three worlds—(as if) the\\n ornament thereof, chaste, adorned with celestial garlands, sprinkled\\n with excellent sandal paste, be-decked with rich ornaments and clad in a\\n precious raiment. Having entered there with out any councillor the\\n vicious Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas, on beholding that chaste damsel\\n with sweet smiles seated on a royal seat, being possessed by desire,\\n grew anxious to hold her by the hand, as one, under the influence of\\n death, catches a sleeping serpent. Beholding that lord of Rākshasas with\\n loose cloth and understanding him as desirous of holding (her) the\\n deity, having huge arms, asleep and enveloped with flames, laughed\\n aloud. And scorched suddenly by his energy, Rāvana, the dread of all\\n people, fell down on earth like unto an up-rooted tree. Beholding that\\n Rākshasa fallen he said the following words:—’Rise up, O foremost of\\n Rākshasas, thou shalt not meet with death today; thou shalt live and be\\n protected, O Rākshasa, by the great Patriarch’s boon. Do thou therefore\\n go away, O Rāvana, with confidence—thou shalt not experience death just\\n now.’ Regaining his sense instantly Rāvana was stricken with fear. And\\n being thus addressed, that enemy, of the celestials, stood up and with\\n his down erect, said to that highly resplendant deity—’Who art thou\\n gifted with great energy and like unto the fire of dissolution? Tell me,\\n who art thou, O deity and whence thou hast come hither.’ Being thus\\n accosted by the vicious-souled Rāvana, the deity, smiling, replied in\\n words deep as the muttering of clouds, saying—’What shalt thou do with\\n me O ten-necked demon? Thou art not to be slain by me now.’ Being thus\\n addressed the Ten-necked demon, with folded palms said—’By the words of\\n the Patriarch (Brahmā) I shall not tread the path of death; there is\\n none born amongst men, or the celestials who can equal me, and\\n disregard; by virtue of his prowess, the great Patriarch’s boon. His\\n words can never be falsified—every great exertion is weak before them; I\\n do not behold any such man in the three worlds who can render that boon\\n useless. O foremost of the deities, I am immortal—I do not fear thee;\\n and even if I meet with death, I may have it from thee and no one else,\\n O Lord. My death from thee is both glorious and praise-worthy.’\\n Thereupon Rāvana, gifted with dreadful prowess, beheld within the body\\n of that deity, all the three worlds with mobile and immobile creations.\\n The Adityas, the Maruts, the Sidhas, the two Aswins, Rudras, the manes,\\n Yama, Kuvera, the oceans, mountains, rivers, all the divisions of the\\n Veda and knowledge, fire, planets, stars, sky, Siddhas, Gandharvas,\\n Chāranas, the ascetics conversant with the knowledge of Vedas, Garuda\\n and the serpents, the other deities, Yakshas, Daityas and Rākshasas,\\n were all seen in their incorporeal forms, on the person of that great\\n Purusha, lying down.\" Thereupon the virtuous-souled Rāma said to\\n Agastya, the foremost of Munis—\"Who is that male being stationed in the\\n island? Who are those three _kotis_ male beings? And who is this person\\n who crusheth down the pride of the Daityās and Dānavas?\" Hearing Rāma’s\\n words Agastya said—\"O thou existing eternally, O god of gods, hearken, I\\n shall relate (it) unto thee. The person stationed in the island is the\\n illustrious Kapila. All those dancing persons are the deities equalling\\n that intelligent Kapila in energy and power. And that Rākshasa, bent on\\n sin, was not seen by him with angry looks, and therefore, Rāma, Rāvana,\\n was not there and then reduced to ashes. And he, resembling a mountain,\\n with his person pierced, fell on the ground. As a wily wight goes\\n through a secret so he pierced (Rāvana’s person) with his shaft-like\\n words. Having regained his sense, however, after a long time, that\\n Rākshasa, of great prowess, returned where his councillors were.\"\\n \\n    ⁸⁰ A fabulous animal supposed to have eight legs.\\n \\n    ⁸¹ A kind of ornament used on arms.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",

And whatever beautiful damsel he saw, married or\\n unmarried, that demon held them captive in his car, having slain all\\n their friends and relatives. In this wise he got on his chariot many a\\n female of the Nagas, Rakshas, Asuras, Yakshas, Dānavas and of men. And\\n they, all afflicted, shed tears, hot as firey flames, caused by fear and\\n fire of grief. As the ocean is filled with the currents of the rivers so\\n that car was flooded with their tears originating from fear and sorrow.\\n And wept there in the chariot, hundreds of the females of Nagas,\\n Gandharvas, of great ascetics, Daityas and of Dānavas. They had long\\n airs, graceful persons, countenances resembling the full-moon, rising\\n breast, slender waist like that of a black-bee and were graceful with\\n back like the pole of a car. They were like the females of the\\n celestials and the burning gold and were all afflicted by grief, sorrow\\n and terror and were young. And the car was ablaze on all sides with the\\n sighings of those damsels and Pushpaka looked like the chamber where\\n fire is kept perpetually. The countenance and eyes, of those beautiful\\n damsels, brought under the subjection of the ten-necked demon, and\\n afflicted with sorrow, looked poorly like a hind attacked by a lion.\\n Some thought—’Will he eat me up?’ and another, stricken with sorrow,\\n thought—’Will he destroy me?’ Thus remembering their mothers, fathers,\\n husbands and brothers, all those females, overwhelmed with grief and\\n sorrow, bewailed, some exclaiming—’What shall befall my son in my\\n absence? Alas! into what ocean of grief my mother or brother is sunk?\\n Alas! what shall my husband do in my absence? Therefore, O death, I\\n propitiate thee, do thou take me, who am subject to miseries. Alas! what\\n an iniquity did I perpetrate in my former birth in another body?\\n Therefore, we all, overwhelmed with grief, are sunk in the ocean of\\n sorrow—and I do not behold the end of my miseries. Oh! fie upon\\n humanity; there is none more vile than a man for they are weak. As the\\n stars disappear with the rising of the sun in time, so our husbands have\\n been destroyed by the powerful Rāvana. Oh! highly powerful is this\\n Raksha and he is mad after devising the means of destruction. Alas!\\n being engaged in such vile actions, he does not consider himself cursed;\\n he is as powerful as he is vicious. And though the ravishment of\\n another’s wife is a greats sin, still that vile Rākshasa is enjoying us\\n who belong to others. Therefore this vicious-minded one shall meet with\\n death, by his own actions.’ As soon as these words were uttered by those\\n chaste damsels, bugles were sounded in heaven and flowery showers fell\\n on earth. Being thus imprecated by those chaste females, devoted to\\n their husbands, he became shorn of energy and effulgence and appeared\\n like one divested of mind. Hearing their lamentations thus and being\\n honored by the night-rangers that foremost of Rākshasas entered his city\\n Lankā. In the interval, Rāvana’s sister, a dreadful and grim-visaged\\n she-demon, suddenly fell down on the ground. And having raised up his\\n sister and consoled her Rāvana said—’Tell me speedily, O good sister,\\n what you wish to say.’ Thereat that she-demon, having blood-red eyes,\\n closed with tears, said:—’O king, by thee, powerful as thou art, I have\\n forcibly been made a widow. Fourteen thousand demons, under the name of\\n Kalakeyas, have been destroyed by thee, O king, in the battle and\\n amongst them was my highly powerful husband—dearer than my life. He has\\n been slain by thee, O dear one, an enemy—a brother only in name. I have\\n been killed by thee, O king, who art my brother. For thee, king, I shall\\n enjoy the word ’widow’!⁸² My husband⁸³ should have been saved by thee in\\n the battle. But he was slain by thy ownself in the battle; art thou not\\n ashamed of this?’ Being thus addressed by his bewailing sister, the\\n Ten-necked demon, consoling her in sweet words, said:—’Of no avail is\\n thy lamentation, dear sister; thou needst not be afraid of any of thy\\n relatives. I shall please thee studiously by gifts, honors and favours.\\n Being mad after war-fare and desirous of acquiring victory, I was\\n continually making a downpour of shafts, so I could not distinguish in\\n the conflict between my own men and enemies,—and thus unwittingly I did\\n hurt thy husband. And thus, sister, thy husband was slain by me in the\\n conflict; I shall now do whatever shall conduce to thy well-being. Do\\n thou ever reside by the side of thy rich brother Khara and he shall be\\n the lord of fourteen thousand Rākshasas. That highly powerful one shall\\n give food and clothes to all those Rākshasas. He is thy cousin and that\\n night-ranger shall always carry out thy orders. Let that hero now\\n speedily go to protect the Dandaka forest and the highly powerful\\n Dushana shall be the commander of his forces.

Being encircled by\\n those grim-visaged Rākshasas, Khara, undaunted, speedily came to the\\n Dandaka forest.

Thereupon that highly powerful lord of Rākshasas with his\\n followers entered an excellent garden in Lankā named Nikumbhilā. And\\n there, he saw, filled with hundreds of sacrificial posts and altars, a\\n sacrifice being celebrated, as if burning in its lustre. And he beheld\\n his fearful son Meghnāda too, clad in an antelope skin and holding\\n _Sikhā_ and _Kamandalu_. Having seen him (there) and embraced him by his\\n arms the lord of Lankā said:—’What are you after, O my child? Tell me\\n the truth.’ Thereupon that foremost of twice-born ones Usanas⁸⁴ of\\n austere penances, wishing the prosperity of the sacrifice, said to\\n Rāvana—the Rākshasa chief:—’Hear, I shall relate to thee everything, O\\n king; thy son hath met with the fruits of many a sacrifice—Agnistoma,⁸⁵\\n Asvamedha,⁸⁶ Bahusubarnaka,⁸⁷ Rajsuya,⁸⁸ Goinedha,⁸⁹ and Baisnaba.⁹⁰ And\\n being engaged in this Mahesvvara sacrifice, which is incapable of being\\n celebrated by men, thy son hath obtained boon from Pasupati⁹¹ himself.\\n \\n \"’He has also obtained illusory powers—which create darkness or\\n ignorance—namely of ranging in the sky, of being eternal, of ascending a\\n celestial car which courses at will and of creating darkness. O lord of\\n Rākshasas, these illusory powers being used in a conflict, even the\\n celestials and Asuras shall not be able to perceive his course. Besides\\n he has obtained a quiver, the arrows whereof shall never be exhausted, a\\n bow, which is hard of being got by and a dreadful weapon which destroys\\n enemies in a conflict. Having obtained these boons thy son, O thou\\n having ten faces, and myself, the sacrifice being finished, have been\\n waiting to behold thee.’ Whereto the Ten-necked demon replied—’You have\\n not done well as you have worshipped, with diverse articles my\\n enemies—Indra and others. However, what is done is done; there is virtue\\n in this—no doubt; come, O gentle one, we shall go to our house.’\\n Thereupon going there with his son and Bibhishana, the Ten-necked demon\\n got down all those damsels, speechless with tears, gifted with\\n auspicious marks, the precious females of the celestials, Dānavas and\\n Raskshasas. Perceiving his vicious desire for those damsels, the\\n virtuous-souled (Bibhishana) said:—’Thou dost (still) follow thy own\\n whims, knowing that people are injured by these actions which destroy\\n piety, wealth and fame. Having slain their kinsmen thou hast brought\\n these beautiful damsels hither, but disregarding thee, O king, Madhu\\n hath carried away Kumbhanasi.’ Rāvana said:—’I do not understand all\\n this. Who is that Madhu, who has been named by thee?’ Worked up with ire\\n Bibhishana said to his brother:—’Hear, the fruit of thy vicious actions\\n hath arrived. There was an old Rākshasa, celebrated for his wisdom,\\n named Malyavān, the elder brother of Sumālin, our maternal grandfather.\\n His grand-daughter is Kumbhanashi and is born of our maternal aunt\\n Analā; so she is virtually our sister. Thy son being engaged in the\\n sacrifice and myself being under waters she was stolen away, O king, by\\n the powerful Rākshasa Madhu. Kumbhakarna, O great king, was then asleep.\\n Having slain all the powerful Rākshasas and thy councillors, he had\\n stolen her away, O king, who was in thy inner apartments. Hearing this\\n even, O great king, we have pardoned and not slain him: an unmarried\\n girl should be given away to her husband by her brothers, but that has\\n not been the case—this is merely the result of thy vicious\\n actions—wicked-minded as thou art, And this thou hast met with\\n instantly—so the people say.’ Hearing the words of Bibhishana, Rāvana,\\n the lord of Rākshasas, became agitated like an ocean, by the\\n recollection of his vicious deeds. And enraged, with blood-red eyes the\\n ten-necked demon said—’Get my chariot ready soon and let all the heroes\\n of our party be prepared. Let my brother Kumbhakarna and other leading\\n night-rangers, armed with various weapons, ascend their conveyances.\\n Having slain today in the encounter that Madhu, who is not afraid of\\n Rāvana, I shall, encircled by my friends, and desirous of battle,\\n proceed to the region of the celestials.’ Thereupon issued out for\\n battle leading Rākshasas four thousand Akshauhini strong taking various\\n weapons. Commanding them Indrajit preceded the army, Rāvana went in the\\n middle and Kumbhakarna was in the rear; the virtuous-souled Bibhisana\\n remained in Lankā, being engaged in pious observances.

And\\n beholding Rāvana proceed, hundreds of Daityas, inimical to the\\n celestials, followed him. Having arrived at the city Of Madhu and\\n entered there the ten-necked demon did not behold Madhu but espied his\\n sister. Thereupon being afraid of the king of Rākshasas, Kumbheenashi,\\n with folded palms, touched his feet with her crown. Having raised her up\\n the Rākshasa-chief Rāvana said ’No fear, what can I do for you?’ Whereto\\n she replied—’O king, O thou having long arms,—if thou art pleased with\\n me, do not slay my husband to-day, O conferrer of honours. It is said\\n there is no other fear like this for damsels of high pedigree. The\\n greatest of fears is that of being a widow. Be thou truthful, O king of\\n kings—do thou look towards me, who am thus begging; Thou hast thyself\\n said, O king; \"No fear.\"’ Being thus addressed Rāvana said to his sister\\n there:—’Do thou tell me speedily where is thy husband.

Out of pity and love\\n for thee I refrain from slaying Madhu.’ Being thus accosted; that\\n Rākshasi, being pleased, got her sleeping husband, the night-ranger, up\\n and said:—’Here is my brother, the highly power Daçagriva.

Do thou therefore proceed to his help, O Rākshasa, with all they\\n friends; It behoves thee to help him, who out of affection for me, hath\\n prayed for thy help.’ Hearing those words Madhu said:—’So be it.’ And\\n approaching a little he beheld that foremost of Rākshasas and duly\\n welcomed Rāvana. Being thus honoured the highly power Daçagriva spent\\n one night in Madhu’s house and then, addressed himself for departure.\\n Thereupon reaching the hill Kailāça, the abode of Baisravan, the lord of\\n Rākshasas, resembling Mahendra, encamped his army.\"\\n \\n    ⁸⁴ Another name of Sukra.

And the\\n clear moon, brilliant as the mountain, having risen, that huge army,\\n armed with diverse weapons, became asleep. And lying down on the summit\\n of the mountain, the highly powerful Rāvana espied the caves beautified\\n with the rays of the moon and the trees. And the interior of the forest\\n was beautified with the brilliant groves of Karnikar, with Kadamba and\\n Vakula trees, groves of full blown lotuses, the waters of Mandākini,\\n with Champaka, Asoka, Punnaga, Mandāra, mangoe, Pātala, Lodra, Pryangu,\\n Arjuna, Ketaka, Tagara, Coconut, Pyāla, Panasa and various other trees.\\n And there sang the Kinnaras, possessed by desire, and having sweet\\n voice, enhancing the delight of the mind. And there danced mirthfully,\\n with their damsels, the Vidyadharas, inebriete and having their eyes\\n reddened with drink. There was audible in the house of the lord of\\n riches, the sweet music of the assembled Apsarās like unto the sound of\\n the bell. And being shaken by the wind the nectar-smelling trees made\\n the hill fragrance with the shower of flowers. And carrying the\\n fragrance rendered salutary with honey and filaments of flowers, the\\n excellent wind blew enhancing Rāvana’s desire. Being possessed by desire\\n through songs, richness of flowers, coldness of air, beauty of the\\n hills, and the rising of the moon in night, the highly powerful Rāvana\\n espied again and again the moon with heavy sighs. At this time passed by\\n that way the foremost of Apsarās, Rambhā, adorned with excellent\\n ornaments and having a countenance like the full moon. Her person was\\n sprinkled with excellent sandal paste—her hairs were decked with Mandāra\\n flowers—her body was beautified with other flowers and her movements\\n tended to increase desire. Her eyes were beautiful and her waist was\\n high, adorned with Mekhala⁹² and was as if the refuge of Rati⁹³. Her\\n forehead and other parts of the countenance were painted with the marks\\n of red sandal and adorned with ornaments of flowers growing in six\\n seasons. Rambhā appeared like second Sree, in grace and beauty, natural\\n and artificial. She wore green clothes resembling the clouds; her face\\n was like the moon, eye brows like excellent bows, thighs like the trunks\\n of elephants and palms soft as leaves. She was seen by Rāvana as\\n proceeding in the midst of soldiers. Having got up and been influenced\\n by lust he took her, shameful as she was, by the hand and smiling\\n said:—’Where art thou going, O beautiful damsel? Whom art thou going of\\n thy own accord to satisfy? Whose prosperous time hath appeared, with\\n whom thou shalt enjoy? Who shall be satisfied with drinking the nectar\\n of thy mouth smelling like lotus? Whose breast, O fair damsel, thy\\n rising breast beautiful like two golden pots closely placed, shall\\n touch? Who is there so beautiful as I—Indra, Vishnu, or two Aswins that\\n thou art passing by me? Do thou take rest upon this excellent rock, O\\n thou having charming waist. There is no other lord, save me, in the\\n three worlds. And Daçānana, the lord of the lords of the three worlds,\\n thus begs thee, with folded palms. Do thou therefore seek me.’ Being\\n thus addressed, Rambhā, trembling, with folded palms, said:—’Be thou\\n propitiated; it doth not behove thee to speak thus, who art my superior.\\n Rather shouldst thou protect me if any body else trieth to oppress me.\\n Virtually I am thy daughter-in-law.

Thy brother Vaisrabana hath a son, dearer\\n than his life, celebrated in the three worlds under the name of\\n Nalakuvara, In virtue he is unto a Brahmin, in prowess he equals a\\n Kshatriya, in anger he is very fire and in patience he is like the\\n earth.

Thou art worthy of being revered by me and I am an object of\\n thy protection.’ Being thus addressed Daçagriva humbly replied:—’\"I am\\n daughter-in-law,\" as thou hast said, is worthy of being said by one who\\n is the only wife. This is the everlasting law of the celestials that the\\n Apsarās have no husband; they cannot be the wife of one husband.’ Having\\n said this, the Raksha ravished her. Being released from his grasp Rambhā\\n became divested of her ornaments and garland and became like the river\\n agitated by the elephants. Her hairs were dishevelled and her hands were\\n trembling. Like unto a blossoming creeper shaken by the wind, she,\\n trembling and bashful and with folded hands, went to Nalakuvara and fell\\n down at his feet. Having seen her in that plight the high-souled\\n Nalakuvara said—’O fair one, what is this? Why hast thou placed thyself\\n at my feet?’ Sighing heavily and trembling she, with folded palms,\\n related to him everything from the beginning to the end. ’O lord, on his\\n way to heaven, Daçagriva hath arrived here and hath spent the night with\\n his army. While I was coming to thee, O slayer of foes, I was seen by\\n him. Then holding me he said—\"Where art thou going?\" I related to him\\n everything truly. But being possessed by lust he did not pay heed to my\\n words. He was again prayed by me, O lord, saying \"I am thy\\n daughter-in-law.\" But neglecting that he ravished me. O thou of firm\\n vows, it behoveh thee to forgive me for this folly. O gentle one, a\\n woman’s strength can never equal that of a man.’ Hearing of this\\n ravishment Vaisravana’s son was greatly enraged and entered into\\n meditation. Having ascertained the truth within a moment Vaisravana’s\\n son, with eyes reddened with ire, took water in his palms. Having taken\\n this and rinsed his mouth duly, he imprecated a dreadful curse upon that\\n lord of Rākshasas. ’O fair one, since thou hast been ravished by him\\n despite thy unwillingness he shall never be able to get by an unwilling\\n damsel. Whenever he shall, stricken by lust, ravish a reluctant damsel,\\n his head shall be sundered into seven pieces’. As soon as this curse,\\n like unto a burning flame, was uttered, the celestial bugles were\\n sounded and a shower of flowers fell from heavens.

The highly powerful Rākshasa hath come\\n here for battle. It is by virtue of the boon that he is powerful, not\\n for anything else. It is proper to make the words uttered by Brahmā,\\n truthful.

He is invincible by virtue of the boon, and that\\n vicious-souled one is incapable of being vanquished even by the\\n celestials and Asuras. Irrepressible by virtue of his prowess, that\\n Rākshasa, with his son, shall accomplish a mighty object. O lord of\\n celestials, even if I am requested by thee, I shall not withstand the\\n Rākshasa, Rāvana in the conflict. Without slaying the enemies in the\\n encounter, Vishnu doth never go back—but it is hard to fulfill my desire\\n from Rāvana, well protected by the boon.

And the\\n two Adityas, the highly powerful Tushthā, and Pushā united and\\n undaunted, entered the arena. Thereupon there arose with Rākshasas a\\n terrible encounter of the celestials unable to bear their fame in\\n battle.

Ascending his car, gifted with the\\n velocity of the wind, the highly powerful one is proceeding amongst the\\n army like unto the deep with waves rising during Parva. It is not\\n possible to slay him now—for he shall not meet with death in consequence\\n of the boon. So let us make him captive—and we should all exert to that\\n end. Bali being held captive I am enjoying the three worlds—and I think\\n proper to obstruct the course of this vicious-souled one.’ Having said\\n this and left aside Rāvana, Sakra went to another side, O King, and\\n fought terrifying the Rākshasas in the conflict. Dacagriva, incapable of\\n being thwarted, entered by the northern route and the performer of\\n hundred sacrifices by the southern. Thereupon having entered into the\\n army up to a hundred leagues—the lord of Rākshasas overpowered the\\n celestial host with a downpour of shafts. Thereupon beholding his own\\n army slain, Sakra returned fearlessly and obstructed the Ten-necked\\n demon. In the interim beholding Rāvana brought under his grasp by Sakra\\n the demons and Rākshasas cried aloud. ’Alas we are slain.’ Thereupon\\n ascending his car Rāvana’s son, beside himself with rage, entered the\\n dreadful flank. And having resorted to the illusory powers, conferred\\n upon him in yore by Paçupati he entered into the enemies’ camp and\\n belaboured them. Having left behind all other deities he pursued Indra\\n and the highly effulgent Mahendra too espied his enemy’s son. And albeit\\n assailed by the highly powerful deities, Rāvana’s son, divested of mail,\\n entertained no fear. Having overpowered the approaching charioteer with\\n many excellent arrows he covered Mahendra with a downpour of shafts.\\n Thereat having left his car and charioteer Indra mounted his elephant\\n Airavat and ran about in search of Rāvana’s son. Being invisible in the\\n welkin by virtue of his illusory powers and having brought Indra under\\n the influence thereof he struck him with hundreds of arrows. When\\n Rāvana’s son came to know that Indra was exhausted he, having bound him\\n up by virtue of illusion, proceeded towards his army. And having seen\\n Mahendra carried away by force from the battle field the deities thought\\n ’What is this?’ That conqueror of Sakra and subduer of enemies,\\n conversant with illusory powers, was not visible, by whom, Indra,\\n although master of many illusions, was carried away by force. In the\\n meantime, the celestials, all enraged, covered Rāvana with a downpour of\\n shafts and belaboured him. And being worn out in the encounter with the\\n Adityas and Vasus he was not capable of fighting any more. Beholding his\\n father thus distressed and assailed in warfare with strokes, Rāvana’s\\n son, although invisible, said—’Do thou come O father, our work in the\\n battle field is finished; know, we have achieved victory; be thou\\n consoled and divested of agonies. By virtue of my illusory powers I have\\n made Mahendra captive—the lord of the three worlds and of the celestial\\n host and have crushed down the pride of the deities. Having subdued thy\\n enemy by virtue of thy prowess do thou enjoy the three worlds at thy\\n pleasure. What is the use of labouring again? And useless it is to fight\\n again.’ Hearing the words of Rāvana’s son the deities retired from the\\n battle field, and went away without Sakra. And hearing the sweet words\\n of his son, the lord of the night-rangers, the enemy of the celestials,\\n having great prowess and wide spread fame, desisted from fighting and\\n affectionately said to his son—’Thou hast enhanced the glory of our race\\n displaying thy prowess like a highly powerful man. Thou hast vanquished\\n the celestials and their king of unequalled might. Do thou set out hence\\n for the city, taking Indra on thy chariot and surrounded by soldiers. I\\n shall, soon, delighted, follow thee with my councillors.’ Thereupon\\n having returned home with his army and chariots and taking the king of\\n the celestials, the powerful son of Rāvana dismissed the victorious\\n warriors.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 35: '## SECTION XXXV.\\n \\n \\n \"The highly powerful Mahendra being thus defeated by Rāvana’s son, all\\n the celestials, taking the patriarch Brahmā before them, went to Lankā.\\n Having obtained Rāvana encircled by his sons and brothers the Patriarch,\\n stationed in the welkin, calmly said—’My son, Rāvana, I have been\\n pleased with thy son in the conflict. Oh! what wonderful prowess, what\\n strength—equal or greater than thine. Thou hast, by thy own prowess,\\n conquered the three worlds—thy promise hath borne fruits—I have been\\n pleased with you—both the father and son. O Rāvana, this thy son is\\n highly powerful and gifted with great strength and he shall be\\n celebrated in the world under the appellation of ’Indrajit’ or the\\n conqueror of Indra. And that Rākshasa shall be powerful and\\n irrepressible, by whose help, O king, the celestials have been brought\\n under thy subjection. Do thou therefore, O thou having long arms,\\n release Mahendra, the chastiser of Paka and for setting him free what do\\n thou want from the celestials?’ Thereupon the highly powerful\\n Indrajit—the subduer of enemies, said:—’If dost thou say so, O god, I\\n pray for immortality.’ Thereat the highly powerful patriarch said to\\n Meghanada—’There is none perfectly immortal on earth amongst created\\n beings—birds, quadrupeds and other highly powerful beings.’ Hearing the\\n words uttered by the grand-father—the highly powerful Meghanāda said to\\n the eternal lord—’Hear, then, what I want in exchange for releasing\\n Sakra. May a chariot with horses rise up from fire when I shall offer\\n sacrifices unto it, being desirous of vanquishing my enemies in the\\n conflict. And may I be immortal as long as I shall remain on that car.\\n This is the boon I have resolved upon praying for. May I meet with\\n destruction, O deity, whenever I shall engage in fight without finishing\\n my offerings unto fire. All others, O god, attain to immortality by\\n virtue of devout penances but I shall acquire that by dint of my own\\n prowess.’ Whereto the grand-father replied saying ’So be it.’ Thereupon\\n Meghanāda released Indra and the celestials returned to their own abode.\\n In the interval, O Rāma, Indra became poorly, divested of his immortal\\n brilliance, stricken with anxiety and pensive. Beholding him in that\\n plight the grand-father of the deities said:—’O performer of hundred\\n sacrifices, why didst thou formerly perpetrate that mighty iniquity? O\\n Chief of the immortals! O lord! Some creatures were created by me by\\n dint of my understanding—they were all of the same colour, same speech,\\n and same appearance. There was no difference visible in their appearance\\n or marks. Thereupon, with whole-minded-ness, I began to think of these\\n created beings. And I created a female distinct from them. Collecting\\n all those limbs that were most excellent amongst the created, I made a\\n female under the name of Ahalyā. _Hal_ means ugliness—one born from\\n _Hal_ is called _Halya_. That female was known as _Ahalyā_ because she\\n had nothing blameable in her. I gave her that name. Having created that\\n female I was thinking, O king of the celestials! O foremost of the\\n deities! On whom I should confer her. Being proud of dignity, O Sakra, O\\n lord, O Purandara thou didst regard her in thy mind as thy spouse. I\\n placed her under the care of the high-souled Gautama and he rendered her\\n back after many long years. Thereupon considering the patience and\\n accomplished asceticism of Gautama I married her with him. And that\\n virtuous-souled, great ascetic enjoyed her company; and for my thus\\n conferring her upon Gautama all the celestials were disappointed. But\\n being enraged and possessed by lust thou didst repair to the hermitage\\n of the ascetic and see her resplendant like the flaming fire. Maddened\\n with lust and ire thou didst ravish her and thou wast seen in that\\n hermitage by the great ascetic. Thou wast then imprecated by him,\\n enraged and gifted with great effulgence saying, \"O lord of the\\n celestials, thou hast attained to a change of circumstances—for which, O\\n Vasava, thou hast fearlessly ravished my spouse. Thou shalt, therefore,\\n O Sakra, go under the arms of the enemies, in conflict. And this vile\\n desire, O thou having a vicious intellect, which thou hast first\\n created, shall undoubtedly spread in the world of mortals. Whoever shall\\n commit this crime, shall be half responsible for it and the other half\\n shall descend upon thee; and forsooth thy position shall not be\\n permanent. And whoever shall be the lord of the celestials, shall not\\n have his position secure. This is the curse I give, which I have\\n communicated to thee.\" And having remonstrated with his wife that one of\\n devout penances said to her—\"O vicious one, let thy beauty be spoiled in\\n the vicinity of the hermitage. Thou art gifted with beauty and youth but\\n thy mind is fickle; so thou shalt not continue as the single beautiful\\n damsel in the world. All created beings shall participate thy beauty;\\n thy matchless beauty has brought about this mischief.\" Thenceforward all\\n created beings were gifted with beauty. Thereupon she propitiated the\\n ascetic Gautama saying, \"O twice-born one, I was unwittingly ravished by\\n Indra, assuming thy form. I have not committed this willingly, O\\n ascetic—so do thou be propitiated with me.\" Ahalyā having said this,\\n Gautama replied:—\"In the race of Ikshwākus, there shall be born a highly\\n effulgent and mighty car-warrior, known in the world as Rāma; for\\n performing the rites of a Brahman, the mighty-armed Vishnu, assuming a\\n human form, shall repair to the forest. Thou shalt be purified when thou\\n shalt behold him, O fair damsel. He shall be able to purify thee from\\n the iniquity perpetrated. Having treated him as a guest when thou shalt\\n come to me again, thou shalt live with me, O thou having a fair\\n countenance.\" Having said this that ascetic returned to his hermitage.\\n And thenceforward the wife, of that ascetic chanting the themes of\\n Brahman, engaged in austere penances. Thou hast met with all this in\\n consequence of the imprecation of that ascetic. Therefore, O thou having\\n long arms, do thou think of thy past iniquity. For that curse and\\n nothing else, O Vasava, thou hast been brought under the grasp of\\n enemies. Having controlled thy senses, do thou soon undertake a\\n sacrifice in honor of Vishnu. Thou shalt be purified by that sacrifice\\n and go to heaven; and thy son, O lord of celestials, hath not been\\n destroyed in the conflict. He hath been taken into the ocean by his\\n grand father.’ Hearing this and having celebrated the sacrifice in honor\\n of Vishnu he again went to the region of celestials and reigned there as\\n their king. I have thus described to thee the strength of Indrajit—what\\n to speak of others he vanquished even Indra—the king of the celestials.\"\\n Hearing the words of Agastya, Rāma, Lakshmana, Vānaras and Rākshasas all\\n said \"Wonderful it is,\" and Bibhishana, who was by the side of Rāma,\\n said:—\"After a long time, the old recollections have come to my mind.\"\\n Thereupon Rāma said to Agastya—\"All, thou hast said, is true.\" And\\n Agastya said \"Rāma, Rāvana, the thorn of people, then grew in power, by\\n whom, in the company of his son, Indra, the lord of the celestials, was\\n defeated.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 36: '## SECTION XXXVI.\\n \\n \\n Thereupon having bowed unto Agastya the foremost of ascetics, the highly\\n effulgent Rāma again surprisingly said:—\"O Brahman, O foremost of\\n twice-born ones, when that cruel Rāvana journeyed over the earth, was it\\n void of people? Was there no king, or prince on earth to administer\\n punishment unto him? Were all the kings then shorn of their strength and\\n prowess? And many kings I (hear) were vanquished and driven out by him\\n with various excellent weapons.\" Hearing the words of Rāghava, the\\n ascetic Agastya, having six sorts of wealth, laughing said, like unto\\n Brahmā, speaking to Rudra—\"O Rāma, O lord of earth, traversing the\\n earth, Rāvana arrived at the city of Mahismati, resembling the city of\\n the celestials, where lived perpetually the deity of fire. There reigned\\n a king named Arjuna, effulgent like fire which was kept perpetually in a\\n well covered with _Sara_. One day the highly powerful Arjuna, the king\\n of _Haihayas_, repaired to the river Nerbuda, with his wives to sport.\\n At the very same day, Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas, arrived there and\\n asked his councillors saying. ’Where is the king Arjuna? Do ye speedily\\n tell me; I am Rāvana, I have come to fight with your king. Do ye, at\\n first, communicate unto him the news of my arrival.’ Being thus\\n addressed by Rāvana, the learned ministers informed the lord of\\n Rākshasas, of the absence of the king. Hearing of the absence of the\\n king from the citizens Visrasraba’s son came out of the city and reached\\n the Vindhya mountain resembling the Himalayas. He espied the mountain\\n extending over the welkin like unto clouds and rising up as if riving\\n the earth and obstructing the sky. The mountain had a thousand summits\\n and the lions were residing in the caves and hundreds of fountains were\\n falling from it; the mountain was as if laughing aloud and the\\n celestials, Gandharvas, Apsarās and Kinsaras were sporting there with\\n their females; and it appeared (in consequence thereof) like the region\\n of celestials; and rivers, with waters transparent like crystal, were\\n flowing. And it therefore appeared like a thousand serpents having\\n trembling tongues. And casting his looks upon Vindhya mountain,\\n resembling the Himalayas and having huge caves, Rāvana, the king of\\n Rākshasas, reached the river Nerbuda, of holy waters and going rapidly\\n to the western ocean. Her waters were being agitated by buffaloes, deer,\\n tigers, lions, bears and elephants distressed by heat. Having covered\\n her, Chakrabakas, Kārandavas, swans, water-cocks and Sārasas, maddened,\\n were emitting notes. The charming Nerbuda appeared like a beautiful\\n damsel—having blossoming trees for her ornaments, Chakrabakas for her\\n breast, wide spread forest for her waist, the row of swans for Mekhala,\\n filaments of flowers for paste, watery foams for white silken cloth, the\\n pleasure of descending into water for the pleasure of touch and\\n full-blown lotuses for white eyes. Having descended from his car and\\n bathed in the waters of Nerbuda, the foremost of streams, resembling a\\n fair one, Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas, with this councilors, sat on\\n her coast resided by many an ascetic. Delighted at her beauty and having\\n spoken highly of Nerbuda like unto Ganges he addressed his ministers\\n Suka and Sārana with gestures, saying:—’Behold, having rendered the\\n earth pale, with his many rays, the sun, emitting parching heat, is in\\n the sky. But seeing me here seated, his rays have become cool like those\\n of the moon. At my fear, even the wind is blowing carefully, being cold\\n and fragrant by the touch of the waters of the Nerbuda and removing our\\n toil. This charming Nerbuda, abounding in crocodiles, fishes and birds,\\n though a natural stream, is standing still like a terrified damsel.\\n Being wounded in conflicts with many a king your persons have been\\n pasted with blood. Therefore like unto Sarvabhauma and other infuriated\\n elephants going down into the water of the Ganges, do ye descend into\\n the water of Nerbuda conferring auspiciousness and health. Bathing in\\n this stream you shall be cleansed from sins. I shall, also on the coast\\n of this river, like the rays of the autumnal moon, reverentially worship\\n with flowers Mahādeva, holding Pināka in his hands.’ Hearing the words\\n of Rāvana, Prahasta, Suka, Sārana, Mahodara, Dhrumākshya and other\\n councillors descended into the waters of Nerbuda. And she was agitated\\n by those elephant-like leading Rākshasas like unto the Ganges by Vamana,\\n Anjana, Padma and other elephants, Thereupon having got up from the\\n waters the highly powerful Rākshasas culled flowers for Rāvana’s\\n offerings. And in a moment the Rākshasas collected heaps of flowers on\\n the picturesque banks of Nerbuda, resembling the white clouds. Flowers\\n being thus collected, Rāvana, the king of Rākshasas descended, into the\\n Nerbuda for bathing like a huge elephant into the Ganges. And having\\n bathed he got up, reciting excellent incantations. Thereupon having left\\n off his wet cloth he put on a white one. And to find out place for\\n worshipping, he, with folded hands, proceeded towards the banks. And the\\n Rākshasas too, like unto so many moving mountains, followed him. And\\n wherever Rāvana went the golden _Siva Linga_ was brought. Thereupon\\n Rāvana placed that upon a heap of sands and began to worship it with\\n various nectar-smelling flowers and sandal. And having finished the\\n worship of Siva, the foremost of deities, having the moon on his crown,\\n the conferrer of boons and the remover of miseries, the night-ranger\\n danced with uplifted hands and sang before it.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 37: '## SECTION XXXVII.\\n \\n \\n \"At no distance from where on the banks of the river Nerbuda, that\\n dreadful lord of Rākshasas collected the flowers, Arjuna, the King of\\n Mahismati, and the foremost of the victorous, was sporting with his\\n wives in the water. And being encircled by them the king Arjuna appeared\\n like a leading elephant surrounded by a thousands of she elephants. In\\n order to measure the strength of his thousand arms the King of\\n _Haihayas_ obstructed the course of Nerbuda. Being obstructed by the\\n arms of Kārtavirjarjuna and having flooded the banks with her pure\\n waters, Nerbuda flowed in an opposite direction. And the currents,\\n rising high as during the rainy season flowed with fishes, and\\n crocodiles. And that stream, as if driven against Rāvana by\\n Kārtavirjarjuna, carried away his collection of flowers. And having\\n given up his worship which was half-finished Rāvana looked towards\\n Nerbuda looking like an unwilling damsel and saw that she, with rising\\n currents, was flowing towards the east from the west and the waters\\n beyond that were in a natural state like a quiet lady and the birds were\\n seated there without any anxiety. Thereupon being anxious to learn the\\n cause of the rise of the river, the Ten-necked demon, with his right\\n finger, hinted Suka and Sārana. Being commanded by Rāvana, the two\\n brothers, the heroic Suka and Sārana proceeded towards the west by the\\n aerial way. And going half a league, the two night-rangers espied a man\\n sporting in the waters with some females. He was huge as a Sāla tree,\\n his hairs were floating on the water, he was inebriete and his eyes were\\n reddened in consequence thereof. Like unto Sumeru holding the earth with\\n his thousand feet he obstructed the current of the river with his\\n thousand arms. And he was surrounded by a thousands of beautiful damsels\\n like an elephant by a thousands of she-elephants. Beholding that\\n dreadful spectacle, the Rākshasas Suka and Sārana came back and\\n approaching Rāvana communicated (all) unto him. ’O lord of Rākshasas, an\\n unknown person, huge as a Sāla tree, is sporting with females\\n obstructing the course of Nerbuda like unto a dam. And being withheld by\\n the thousand arms of that man the waters of Nerbuda were continually\\n throwing up high waves.’ Hearing the words of Suka and Sārana, Rāvana\\n exclaimed ’This is Arjuna’ and proceeded to fight with him. Rāvana, the\\n lord of Rākshasas, having set out with a hostile intention against\\n Kārtavirjarjuna, the wind mixed with dust began to blow high with\\n tumultuous sound. And the clouds began to mutter with a downpour of\\n rain. And the lord of Rākshasas proceeded against Arjuna with Mahodara,\\n Mahaparswa, Dhrumākshya, Suka and Sairana. Within a short time the\\n dreadful Rākshasa, powerful as the elephant Arjuna, reached the banks of\\n Nerbuda and espied there Arjuna encircled by females as an elephant\\n surrounded by she-elephants. At the very sight the eyes of the lord of\\n Rākshasas, proud of his prowess, grew red and addressing the councillors\\n of the king Arjuna he said ’Do ye communicate unto the king of\\n _Haihayas_ that Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas, hath come to fight with\\n him.’ Hearing the words of Rāvana, the ministers of Arjuna stood up with\\n arms and said ’O good Rāvana, thou art well cognizant of the proper time\\n for fighting. Now our king is drunk and is sporting with the females in\\n the waters. And now dost thou wish to fight with him. Therefore, O\\n Ten-necked one, do thou spend the night here, if thou art bent upon\\n fighting. Or even if thou art anxious to enter speedily into conflict\\n with Arjuna do thou slay us all at first, and then fight with the king.’\\n Thereupon the hungry councillors of Rāvana slew some of the ministers of\\n the king and devoured some. There arose a dreadful uproar on the banks\\n of Nerbuda, of the councillors of Rāvana and Arjuna. The warriors of\\n Arjuna assailed Rāvana and his ministers with hundreds of arrows,\\n Praças, darts, Tomaras, thunder-bolts and Karpanas. The warriors of\\n Arjijna became dreadfully furious and emitted cries like the roaring of\\n the deep infested with crocodiles, fishes and other marine monsters.\\n Thereupon being enraged and displaying their own prowess Suka, Sārana\\n and other ministers of Rāvana began to destroy Arjuna’s soldiers.\\n Thereupon the emissaries, stricken with fear, went to the sporting king\\n and communicated unto him the proceedings of Rāvana and his ministers.\\n Hearing those words and saying unto the females ’Do not fear’ he rose up\\n from the waters like an elephant. The eyes of that fire-like Arjuna were\\n reddened with ire and he shone dreadfully like the fire of dissolution.\\n And taking up speedily his club, that one, always using golden clubs,\\n pursued the Rākshasas like unto darkness following the sun. Holding up\\n the huge club and hurling it with his arms, Arjuna, resorting to the\\n velocity of Garuda, went on. Thereupon stood there obstructing his\\n course the Rākshasa, worked up with anger and with a mace in his hand,\\n like unto the Vindhya range standing in the way of the sun. And throwing\\n down off his hand the iron mace, he, in anger, began to roar, like Yama.\\n And the top of the mace was ablaze like the tips of Asoka flowers. Not\\n the least agitated on beholding that mace, the king Arjuna, by his club,\\n baffled its action. Thereupon uplifting the huge club, five hundred\\n hands long, the king of _Haihayas_ pursued Prahasta. And within a short\\n time being struck down by that club gifted with great velocity Prahasta\\n fell down on earth like unto the summit of a mountain clapped down by\\n the thunder-bolt of Indra. Beholding Prahasta fallen, Māricha, Suka,\\n Sārana, Mahodara and Dhrumākshya fled away from the battle-field. All\\n the councillors having thus fled away and Prahasta being slain Rāvana\\n speedily proceeded towards Arjuna, the foremost of kings. Thereupon\\n there ensued a terrible encounter capable of making down erect between\\n the thousand-armed Arjuna, the king of men, and the twenty-armed Rāvana,\\n the king of Rākshasas. And taking up their clubs Arjuna and Rāvana began\\n to fight with one another emitting cries like the mutterings of clouds,\\n like unto two huge bulls fighting for a cow, two agitated oceans, two\\n moving mountains, two effulgent Adityas, two burning flames, two proud\\n elephants, two proud lions and like the very Rudra and Kāla. As the\\n mountains suffer many clappings of thunder-bolts so did they bear many\\n strokes. And all the quarters were resounded with the sound proceeding\\n from the stroke of their clubs like unto the sound of thunder-bolts.\\n Being placed against the breast of Rāvana Arjuna’s club rendered, for a\\n moment, the welkin look like the burning gold as does the lightning. And\\n striking again and again against Arjuna’s breast Rāvana’s club looked\\n like a huge fire-brand. Arjuna was not worn out nor was Rāvana. And the\\n conflict went on between them like the encounter between Bala and Vasava\\n in the days of yore. The King of men and the King of Rakshasas assailed\\n and wounded one another with their clubs like unto two bulls striking\\n one another with their horns and two elephants with their tusks.\\n Thereupon worked up with rage, Arjuna, with his full might, smote Rāvana\\n on his breast, with his club. But Rāvana was well protected by the boon\\n of the celestial, so the club fell on earth sundered into two pieces\\n like one hurled by a weak wight. Still wounded by the mace of Arjuna,\\n Rāvana, shedding tears, ran away at a distance of four feet and sat\\n there. Beholding Rāvana thus over-whelmed Arjuna sprang up and caught\\n him like Garuda holding a serpent and Vishnu binding Bali. Daçagriva\\n being thus bound, the Siddhas, Charanas and the celestials exclaiming\\n ’Well done! Well done!!’ showered flowers upon Arjuna. And the king\\n emitted leonine roars again and again as a tiger joyous roars like a\\n cloud, holding a deer under his grasp. Regaining his sense and beholding\\n Rāvana bound, Prahasta, in great anger, pursued the King of _Haihayas_.\\n And the Rakshasa force grew tempestuous like unto the rising of the\\n ocean during rains. Thereupon exclaiming repeatedly ’Leave him off!\\n Leave him off!! Wait! Wait!!’ The Rākshasa host hurled hundreds of\\n Musalas and darts in the battle-field. Not the least moved thereby the\\n king Arjuna, the slayer of enemies, bore those weapons of the enemies of\\n the celestials. Thereupon baffling the weapons of the Rākshasas by means\\n of many a dreadful and excellent one, Arjuna, the king of _Haihayas_,\\n drove them away like winds scattering the clouds. Having thus struck\\n terror unto the night-rangers, he, encircled by his own kinsmen,\\n repaired to his own city with Rāvana, carrying him bound like unto Indra\\n carrying Bali bound. Thereupon flowers and fried paddy were showered\\n upon him by the Brāhmanas and citizens.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",

Proceeding by the aerial way, that twice-born one,\\n gifted with the velocity of wind and the flight of mind, reached the\\n city of Mahishmati. Like unto Brahmā entering Indra’s Amaravati, he\\n entered the city resembling the capital of Indra and filled with\\n delighted and plump citizens. And beholding that dreadful Rishi approach\\n like unto Adityā walking on foot, the warders communicated the\\n intelligence unto the king Arjuna. Understanding from their words that\\n Pulastya was coming, the king of _Haihayas_, placing his folded palms on\\n his crown, proceeded to welcome him. Like, unto Vrihaspati preceeding\\n Purandara, the royal priests went before him carrying _Maduparka_ and\\n water to wash feet. And beholding the ascetic resembling the rising sun\\n arrived, the king Arjuna bowed unto him reverentially like Indra\\n saluting Mahideva. Thereupon offering him Maduparka, cow and water to\\n wash feet, the king of _Haihayas_ in accents obstructed with delight,\\n addressed the ascetic saying:—’Reverend Sir, thine visit, it is hard to\\n obtain. On beholding thee my city Mahishmati hath been turned into\\n Amaravati. To-day have I obtained all auspiciousness, O lord; to-day\\n hath my religious observance been fruitful; to-day hath my birth proved\\n blessed and to-day hath my devout penance been crowned with success, for\\n I bow unto thy feet, which have been worshipped by the celestials. This\\n my kingdom, these my sons, this my wife and myself are all at thy\\n disposal—do thou order me, O Brahman, what I may do for thee.’ Thereupon\\n having enquired of the king about his piety, offerings and the\\n well-being of his sons, Pulastya said to Arjuna, the king of\\n Haihayas:—’O foremost of kings, O thou having eyes like lotus-petals! O\\n thou having a countenance like the full moon! When thou hast vanquished\\n Rāvana, thy prowess is matchless in the triple world. Thou hast bound up\\n my invincible son in the conflict at whose fear the wind and the ocean\\n stand still. Having drunk up the glories of my son thou hast announced\\n thine own; so I do say, O my son, do thou release Daçānana.’ Hearing\\n this command of Pulastya, the king Arjuna did not utter a single word\\n and set, most delightedly the king of Rākshasas, free. Having released\\n that foe of the celestials, worshipped him with celestial ornaments and\\n garlands and established friendship removing all enmities with Rāvana\\n before fire, and bowed unto Pulastya, the son of Brahmā, he repaired to\\n his own house. And being released by the influence of Pulastya, the\\n highly powerful Daçānana, the king of Rākshasas, accepted his\\n hospitality and being embraced by him, returned home ashamed. And having\\n set Daçagriva at liberty Pulastya, the son of Brahmā and the foremost of\\n Munis repaired to the celestial region. O Rāma, in this wise, the highly\\n powerful Rāvana was defeated by Arjuna and released by Pulastya. Observe\\n therefore, O descendant of Raghu, there is a mightier man than the\\n mighty; therefore, one, desirous of his own well-being, should not\\n disregard another. Having acquired friendship with the thousand-armed\\n Arjuna, Dacānana, the king of Rākshasas, began again to journey over the\\n world distressing the kings.\"\\n \\n    ⁹⁵ As it is impossible to hold the wind in a short compass so it was\\n       impossible to bind Rāvana and lead him captive.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",

O Rāvana, O Rākshasa, even if thou hast drunk nectar, thou\\n shalt at this very moment loose thy life, when the encounter with Vāli\\n shall take place. O Vaisravana, do thou observe the variegated universe\\n now—wait for a moment after which it will be hard for thee to keep thy\\n life. Or if thou dost wish to meet with death do thou speedily repair to\\n the southern ocean and thou shalt behold there Vāli like unto fire\\n placed on earth.’ Hearing those words, Rāvana, the aggrandiser of the\\n triple world, remonstrated with Tārā and ascending his flowery car went\\n to the southern ocean and espied Vāli, having red countenance like the\\n rising sun, engaged in Sandhyā rites with whole-mindedness. Thereupon\\n having descended from his Pushpaka car he with silent steps approached\\n Vāli to bring him under his grasp. Casting his looks at pleasure, Vāli\\n saw him. Albeit apprised of his evil intention, he was not the least\\n moved. And he did not care for him as a lion is not moved on beholding a\\n hare and Garuda on beholding a serpent. He then thought within\\n himself—’This vicious-souled Rāvana is approaching to catch me; holding\\n him under my arm pit I shall journey over the three great oceans.\\n Everyone will behold the enemy Rāvana, under my arm pit as a serpent\\n possessed by Garuda, with his thighs, arms and clothes loosened.’ Having\\n thought thus Vāli remained silent for sometime and reciting incantations\\n he waited there like a mountain. Thereupon the king of monkeys and the\\n lord of Rakshasas, proud of strength, essayed to catch one another. Vāli\\n was seated with his back (towards Rāvana); still from his footsteps he\\n perceived that he had come within the grasp of Rāvana’s army and he at\\n once caught hold of him like unto Garuda holding a serpent. Getting hold\\n of Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas, desirous of catching him, (Vāli) and\\n placing him under his arm-pit Vāli vehemently rose high up in the\\n welkin. And he went away carrying him, scratching him again and again\\n with his nails like unto winds scattering clouds. The Ten-necked demon\\n being thus carried away, his councillors, to release him, pursued,\\n exclaiming, Vāli, in the welkin. They thus following him, Vāli, appeared\\n in the sky like the sun in the midst of clouds. The Rākshasas could not\\n catch Vāli but were rather exhausted by the stroke of his arms and\\n thighs. What to speak of animals made of flesh and blood anxious for\\n their lives even the mountains make way when Vāli goes. Rising high up\\n into the sky where even the birds cannot reach, Vāli, the lord of\\n monkeys and gifted with great velocity, by and by finished his Sandhyā\\n rites above the oceans. Being worshipped by the aerials their lord, with\\n Rāvana, first proceeded to the western ocean. And having finished there\\n Sandhyā prayers and recited incantations he, with Daçānana, went to the\\n northern ocean. And having journeyed over many thousand leagues that\\n huge monkey, with his enemy, finished his prayers there and then\\n proceeded to the eastern ocean. And having recited his prayers there\\n also, Vāli, the son of Indra, and the king of monkeys, carrying Rāvana,\\n returned to the city of Kishkindhā. Having gone through his Sandhyā\\n rites at the four oceans and carrying Rāvana, that monkey-chief was\\n greatly exhausted and (therefore) descended into the gardens of\\n Kishkindhā. Having got out Rāvana from his arm-pit, the foremost of\\n monkeys, laughing again and again said:—’Whence art thou coming?’\\n Thereupon being surprised greatly, Daçānana, the king of Rākshasas, with\\n eyes shaking with exhaustion, said to the king of monkeys:—’O king of\\n monkeys, resembling Mahendra, I am Rāvana, the king of Rākshasas; I came\\n here to fight: but I have been defeated by thee. Alas! What strength is\\n thine! what prowess!! What gravity!!! Holding me like a beast thou hast\\n journeyed over the four oceans. O hero! What heroic wight is there who\\n is not exhausted by carrying me so vehemently? O monkey, mind, wind and\\n Garuda—these three are gifted with the velocity. Undoubtedly thou hast\\n got the same velocity. Thy prowess hath been sufficiently displayed. But\\n now I wish, O king of monkeys, to make friends with thee for ever before\\n fire. O king of monkeys, from to-day, wife, sons, city, kingdom,\\n enjoyment, cloth and food shall be our common.’ Thereupon having lighted\\n up fire the king of monkeys and the king of Rakshasas, embracing each\\n other, became friends. Thereupon holding each other by the arms they\\n entered the city of Kishkindhā like unto two lions, entering delightedly\\n a cave. There like Sugriva Rāvana spent a month. Afterwards his\\n councillors, desirous of destroying the triple world, took him away. O\\n lord Rāma, I have thus related to thee the previous history. Having thus\\n belaboured Rāvana Vāli at last made friends with before fire. O Rāma,\\n Vāli had unequalled and great strength, Like unto fire burning down\\n locusts thou didst burn down Vāli.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 40: '## SECTION XL.\\n \\n \\n Thereupon Rāma, being stricken with curiosity, with folded palms and\\n humbly accosted Agastya, residing in the southern quarter, with pregnant\\n accents, saying;—\"Thou sayest that Rāvana and Vāli had unequalled\\n strength but methinks theirs can not equal that of Hanumān. Heroism,\\n liberality, strength, patience, intellect, knowledge of laws and means,\\n prowess and energy all exist together in Hanumān. When the monkey host\\n lost heart on beholding the ocean, Hanumān, consoling crossed over the\\n deep extending over a hundred leagues. Having desecrated the presiding\\n goddess of Lankā and on beholding Sitā there, he consoled her. What to\\n speak of more, Hanumān, single-handed, slew Rāvana’s commander-in-chief,\\n the minister’s son, his servants and his one son. Being released from\\n the Brahma weapon Hanumān remonstrated with Rāvana, and reduced Lankā\\n into ashes like unto fire burning down earth. What I have seen myself\\n performed by Hanumān in the conflict is above the power of Kāla, Vāsava\\n and even the lord of riches. It is by the strength of the arms of that\\n Wind-god’s son I have obtained Lankā, Sitā, Lakshrnana, Victory, kingdom\\n and my friends. What more, had not Hanumān, the friend of the king of\\n monkeys—Sugriva, been in my company who could have brought Sitā’s\\n intelligence? Why did not Hanumān, although wishing welfare unto\\n Sugriva, reduce Vāli to ashes like so many creepers on the occasion of\\n his quarrel with Sugriva? Methinks, Hanumān was not cognisant of his own\\n prowess then? And therefore he did stoop to witness the miseries of\\n Sugriva—the king of monkeys who was dearer than his life. O thou\\n worshipped of the immortals, do thou truly describe unto me this action\\n of Hanumān.\" Hearing those well-meaning words of Rāghava, the ascetic\\n Agastya said to him in the presence of Hanumān. \"O foremost of Raghus,\\n what thou hast said regarding Hanumān is all true. As regards, strength,\\n velocity and intellect there is none who can equal Hanumān. O represser\\n of enemies, in the days of yore Hanumān was imprecated by the ascetics,\\n whose curses never become fruitless, to the effect that he would never\\n be conscious of his whole strength. I am not capable of describing to\\n thee the wondrous childish feat which Hanumān did perform in his\\n boyhood. But if thou art, O Rāghava, greatly anxious to hear it, I shall\\n relate—do thou hear with a quiescent mind. Hanumān’s father Keshari\\n reigned in the mountain Sumeru which resembles gold by the influence of\\n the sun. Keshari had a well-known wife by the name of Anjanā to whom he\\n was greatly attached. The deity Wind begot on Anjanā an excellent son.\\n Repairing to a dense forest for collecting fruits, the excellent damsel\\n gave birth to Hanumān resembling the tip of a Sāla tree and went away.\\n Being distressed with hunger on account of the absence of the mother,\\n Hanumān, just born, cried like Kartikeya, the commander-in-chief of the\\n celestials, in the forest of _Saras_. At this time the sun resembling\\n _Yavā_ flowers, having risen, Hanumān, to get a fruit, sprang up. Being\\n desirous of holding the newly risen sun, Hanumān, resembling it, began\\n to leap in the middle of the welkin. The child Hanumān having thus\\n ascended the sky, celestials, Dānavas and Yakshas surprisingly exclaimed\\n ’The velocity, with which Marut’s son is going, is not possessed even by\\n the Wind, Garuda and mind. If he has got such vehemence in his boyhood\\n what great strength he shall have in his youth.’ His own son thus\\n leaping, the wind, becoming cool by the touch of snow, began to follow\\n him proceeding in the sky lest the rays of the sun might scorch him.\\n Rising high up in the sky on account of childish freaks and traversed\\n many thousand leagues by the help of his father Hanumān neared the sun.\\n Considering that he was a mere child and therefore not tarnished by any\\n sin and that a great divine work would be accomplished by him in future\\n the sun did not burn Hanumān. At the every day when Hanumān sprang up to\\n hold the sun, Rahu too essayed to possess him. Having reached the top of\\n the sun’s car Hanumān touched Rahu; so he, the represser of the moon’s\\n rays, accordingly went back on beholding the sun thus possessed. And\\n repairing to the house of Indra, Sinhika’s son, in wrath and with\\n frowns, said to him encircled by the celestials:—’O Vasava! O slayer of\\n Bala and Vitra—to remove my hunger thou didst give me both the sun and\\n moon; why thou hast then given them to another? On account of the\\n _Parva_ I came to devour the sun but another Rahu came and possessed\\n him.’ Hearing the words of Rahu, the King of the deities, wearing a\\n golden garland, having his understanding bewildered, proceeded, on the\\n back of his elephant-chief Airavat, huge like the summit of the Kailasa\\n hill, with temporal juice always trickling, having four tusks, roaring,\\n and adorned with golden bells, towards Hanumān and the sun with Rahu\\n before him. Having left behind Indra, Rahu quickly went there but fled\\n away on beholding the huge-bodied Hanumān resembling a mountain summit.\\n Thereupon leaving aside the sun and being desirous of holding Rāhu, the\\n son of Sinhikā considering him as a fruit, Hanumān again sprang up into\\n the sky. Beholding Hanumān approach renouncing the sun, Rahu with his\\n countenance only visible, desisted and went back. And considering Indra\\n as the saviour he again and again cried aloud ’Indra! Indra!!’\\n Understanding everything by the piteous accents of Rahu Indra said, ’No\\n fear, I shall soon slay him.’ Thereupon beholding the huge-bodied\\n Airavat and considering him as a bigger fruit Māruti ran towards him.\\n Proceeding thus tempestuously when he rose above the head of Indra,\\n Hanumān, looked in a moment dreadful like the fire of dissolution. But\\n not greatly enraged the thousand-eyed lord of Sachi, with the\\n thunder-bolt in his hand, struck the running Hanumān. Belaboured by the\\n thunder-bolt of Indra Hanumān fell down and broke his left jaw. He being\\n thus overwhelmed by the stroke of Indra’s thunder-bolt, the Wind-god\\n became displeased with the king of celestials and was determined upon\\n bringing about mischief unto all created beings. The all-comprehending\\n wind, not spreading himself, entered into a cave with his son. Like unto\\n Vāsava distressing all creatures by putting a stop to the showers, the\\n wind too put all animals into unbearable suffering by obstructing all\\n execrations. On account of the anger of the Wind-god their breath was\\n completely obstructed, and the joints—as if pierced, became hard as\\n wood. _Sādhya_ _Vasatkār_ and all the religious observances of the\\n triple world were put a stop to by the anger of the Wind-god. So the\\n three worlds appeared as if stricken with sorrow. Thereupon the\\n afflicted celestials, Gandharvas, Asuras and men repaired to the\\n Patriarch Brahmā with a view to bring about the well-being of created\\n beings. And with their bellies swollen for the obstruction of the wind\\n the celestials with folded hands said:—’O lord of created beings, thou\\n hast created four classes of beings and thou hast given us wind to\\n preserve our lives. But we do not know, why the wind, the lord of our\\n beings, is distressing us, by obstructing our movements like unto\\n females confined in an inner apartment. Being thus distressed by the\\n wind we have come to seek thy shelter, O thou the remover of miseries—do\\n thou remove our afflictions consequent upon the obstruction of the\\n wind.’ Hearing those words of the created beings, their lord (the\\n Patriarch Brahmā) again said ’Hear, why the wind, being enraged, has\\n obstructed the course of all beings. Hearing the words of Rahu, Indra,\\n the king of the celestials, hath belaboured the Wind-god’s son. It is\\n for this that he hath been offended. Preserving the bodied, the wind,\\n having no person, passes through them all. Without wind the body becomes\\n like wood. Therefore the wind constitutes the life, the happiness and\\n the whole universe. Renouncing the wind the world cannot attain to\\n happiness. Being cast off by the wind and having their breaths\\n obstructed, behold, the world, to-day appeareth like dried wood. Let us\\n therefore go there where the wind, the giver of our afflictions,\\n waiteth. If we do not please the son of Aditi we shall all meet with\\n destruction.’ Thereupon the Patriarch Brahmā, the celestials,\\n Gandharvas, serpents, Guhyakas and other created beings went where the\\n wind was waiting with his own son belaboured by the king of the\\n celestials. Thereupon beholding that boy, on the lap of the Wind-God,\\n resembling gold and Baisvanar, the four-mouthed Brahmā, the celestials,\\n Gandharvas, Rishis, Yakshas and Rākshasas were all moved with pity.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 41: '## SECTION XLI.\\n \\n \\n Hearing the whole history, Rāma, the descendant of Raghu, said to\\n Agastya \"O Reverend Sir, Riksharaja is the name of the father of Vāli\\n and Sugriva but thou hast not told me the name of their mother. However\\n I am curious to learn who was their mother, where was their residence,\\n and how they had been named so—do thou favour me with the account.\" Rāma\\n having said this Agastya said:—\"O Rāma, I shall relate to thee\\n everything in short of what I had heard from Nārada when he came to my\\n hermitage. Once on a time whilst travelling that highly pious ascetic\\n arrived at my hermitage; I duly worshipped and welcomed him; and when I\\n asked him out of curiosity, he, seated at pleasure, said:—’Hear, O great\\n ascetic, the foremost of the pious; there is a mountain named Meru,\\n highly picturesque, made of gold and greatly charming. The middle peak\\n is much liked by the celestials, on which is situate the beautiful\\n assemblage hall of Brahmā extending over a hundred leagues. The\\n four-mouthed deity, sprung from lotus, always resideth there. And from\\n his eyes while going through the _Yoga_ practices tears trickled down.\\n No sooner the Patriarch Brahmā, with his hands, wiped them off into the\\n ground than a monkey originated from those tears. O foremost of men, as\\n soon as that monkey was produced, the high-souled Brahmā consoled him in\\n sweet accents and said—\"Do thou proceed to that leading mountain where\\n the celestials perpetually reside. O foremost of monkeys, living upon\\n many a fruit and root in that picturesque mountain thou shouldst always\\n live by me. And while thou shall live in this wise for some time thou\\n shalt be crowned with auspiciousness.\" Brahmā having said this, O\\n Rāghava, the foremost of monkeys saluted that god of gods, placing his\\n head at his feet and said to that Primaeval deity, the creator of beings\\n and the lord of the universe. \"O god, thou art placing me under thy\\n behests—verily I shall follow them.\" Having said this to Patriarch that\\n monkey immediately went to a forest abounding in fruits and flowers.\\n There living on fruits and collecting honey and various flowers, he,\\n every day, used to come to Brahmā in the evening. O Rāma, in this wise\\n he used to make an offering of excellent fruits and flowers at the feet\\n of Brahmā, the god of gods. Journeying in this way over the mountain he\\n spent many long years. Some time having elapsed in this way, O Rāghava,\\n Riksharaja, the foremost of monkeys, being distressed with thirst,\\n repaired to the excellent mountain Meru. There is a pond of pure water,\\n resonant with the notes of various birds. Having shaken his manes with a\\n delighted heart, Riksharaja saw his reflection in the waters. Beholding\\n his own image there that monkey-chief, stricken with anger and anxiety\\n thought—\"What arch-enemy of mine is living in the waters? I shall\\n destroy the excellent abode of the vicious-souled one.\" Thinking thus\\n within himself, that monkey, out of fickleness, jumped down into the\\n lake. And he again sprang up therefrom. And at the time of rising, O\\n Rāma, that leading monkey found himself metamorphosed into a female\\n form, which was highly charming, graceful and beautiful. Her waist was\\n spacious, eye-brows beautiful and hairs were black and curling; her\\n countenance was beautiful and smiling, breast high and beauty matchless.\\n And there appeared charming on the banks of the lake, lighting up all\\n quarters that female, agitating the mind of all, and beautiful in the\\n triple world like unto simple _Sastilatā_, Ramā, without lotus, pure\\n rays of the moon, Parvati more beautiful than even Lakshmi. At this time\\n was returning by that way, Indra, the leader of the celestials after\\n having worshipped the feet of Brahmā. And the sun too journeying arrived\\n there. They both simultaneously espied that female form and were\\n possessed by desire. What more, their whole body, as soon as they saw\\n her, was moved and the firmness of the mind shaken. Thereupon Indra\\n begot on her a son named Vāli for he originated from her hairs and the\\n sun begot on her another son, who was named Sugriva for he originated\\n from her neck. Thus the two highly powerful monkeys being born, Indra\\n went back to his region having conferred upon Vāli an un-ending garland\\n of gold. And having engaged Hanumān, the Wind-god’s son in the service\\n of Sugriva, the sun too went back to the sky. O king, the sun having\\n risen after, that night Riksharaja again obtained his own real monkey\\n shape. Having thus regained his monkey form he made his two highly\\n powerful sons,—leading monkeys, assuming shapes at will and having tawny\\n eyes, drink honey, like nectar. Thereupon taking them, he came to the\\n abode of Brahmā. Beholding his son Riksharaja with his sons, Brahmā, the\\n grand-father of the celestials, consoled him in diverse ways. Then he\\n ordered the celestial messenger saying—\"At my behest, O emissary, do\\n thou proceed to the highly picturesque city of Kishkindhā. That golden,\\n big and charming city is worthy of Riksharajā. There live many thousand\\n monkeys besides others assuming shapes at will. It abounds in various\\n jewels, invincible, is inhabited by four _Varnas_, holy and sacred. At\\n my command Visvvakarmā has constructed the celestial and picturesque\\n city of Kishkindhā. Do thou place there Riksharāja, the foremost of\\n monkeys, with his sons; and having invited the leading monkeys and\\n others and received them courteously do thou install him on the throne.\\n On beholding this monkey-chief, gifted with intelligence they shall be\\n all subject to him.\" Brahmā, having said this, the celestial emissary,\\n with Riksharāja before him, proceeded to the highly picturesque city of\\n Kishkindhā. And having entered there with the velocity of the wind, he,\\n at the command of the Patriarch, crowned the leading monkey Riksharāja\\n as king. And being sprinkled according to the ceremonies of\\n installation, and adorned with a crown and various other ornaments he,\\n with a delighted heart, engaged in governing the monkeys. All the\\n monkeys, residing on earth consisting of seven insular continents and\\n bounded by ocean, came under his subjection. Thus Riksharāja was both\\n the father and mother of Vāli and Sugriva. May good betide thee. The\\n learned who listen to and make others hear this story, conducing to the\\n enhancement of their delight, get all their desires and objects\\n accomplished. I have duty described to thee at length all events and\\n have recounted the stories relating to the birth of the Kings of monkeys\\n and Rākahsasas.’\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 42: '## SECTION XLIII.\\n \\n \\n Hearing this excellent Paurānic theme in the company of his brothers,\\n Rāghava was greatly surprised. Thereupon hearing the words of the Rishi\\n he said:—\"By thy favour I have listened to the highly sacred theme. O\\n foremost of Munis. I was greatly worked up with curiosity in this\\n matter. I am not the least surprised to learn, O twice-born one, that\\n those two sons of the celestials would be two highly powerful leading\\n monkeys since their origin is divine.\" Rāma having said this Agastya\\n said:—\"O thou having long arms, thus in the days of yore the birth of\\n Vāli and Sugriva was brought about. O king, I shall now again relate to\\n thee another divine theme. O Rāma I shall now describe to thee why did\\n Rāvana steal Sitā. Do thou hear it attentively. O Rāma, in the golden\\n age, having bowed unto the Patriarch’s son, the truthful Rishi\\n Sanatkumar, highly effulgent, resplendent like unto the sun, shining in\\n his native brilliance and seated at his own place, Rāvana, the lord of\\n Rākshasas, said:—’Who is now amongst the celestials brave and powerful,\\n by whose help the celestials can vanquish their enemies and whom the\\n twice-born ones daily worship and the devotees meditate upon. O thou\\n having piety for wealth, O thou gifted with six sorts of wealth, do thou\\n describe this to me kindly.’ Being apprised of Rāvana’s intention, the\\n saint Sanatkumar, who saw every thing through his devotion, said to him\\n out of love—’Hear my son. The learned duly, in their sacrifices, worship\\n that Hari, respected of people and drinking nectar, who is the lord of\\n the universe, whoso origin we do not know, who is daily worshipped by\\n the celestials and Asuras, who is highly powerful Nārāyana from whose\\n navel has sprung Brahmā, the creator of the world, and who has created\\n the universe consisting of mobile and immobile beings. The Yogis\\n meditate upon him and celebrate sacrifices in his honor according to the\\n Purānas, Vedas, _Pancharātra_ and other rituals. He always vanquisheth\\n in encounter Daityas Danavas, Rakshasas and all other enemies of the\\n celestials and every one of them worships him.’ Hearing those words of\\n the great ascetic Sanatkumar, Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas, bowing,\\n replied:—’Being slain by Hari to what station do the Daityas, Danavas\\n and Rākshasas attain? And why doth Hari destroy them?’ Whereto\\n Sanatkumar replied:—’Whoever are slain by the celestials do eternally\\n reside in their region. And being banished therefrom, they again take\\n their birth on earth. Thus by the misery and happiness acquired in their\\n pristine existence, they go through births and deaths. O king, all the\\n monarchs, slain by Janarddana, holding discus and the lord of the triple\\n world, attained to his own region; even his anger becometh like a boon.’\\n Hearing those words given vent to by the great ascetic Sanatkumar the\\n night-ranger Rāvana, being worked up with delight and surprise, began to\\n meditate how he should enter into conflict with Hari.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",

That great deity\\n pervadeth all, is minute, invisible ever-existing, and manifest over the\\n universe consisting of mobile and immobile creations. He is present in\\n the celestial region, in the earth, in the region underneath the earth,\\n on the mountains, in the forests, in all stationary objects, in all\\n rivers and in all cities.

He alone can see\\n him with whom he is pleased, O my son; neither by the fruits of\\n sacrifices, asceticism, self-control, gifts, sacrifices, nor by anything\\n else can one behold the Illustrious Deity. Those alone can see Him, who\\n have devoted themselves, their life and being, unto Him and who, by\\n virtue of discriminative knowledge, have got their sins burnt. If thou\\n art willing to behold him, hear, if thou dost like, I shall describe\\n everything at length. At the end of the golden age and the beginning of\\n Tretā Yuga the deity Nārāyana shall assume a human form for the benefit\\n of men and celestials.

Thou dost\\n observe the whole universe like a myrobalam in thy palms.’ Hearing the\\n words of Rāvana, the celestial saint said:—’O lord of Rākshasas, the\\n inhabitants of Swetadwipa are perpetually devoted unto Nārāyana with\\n whole-mindedness and earnestly worship Him. They have always their\\n hearts and minds devoted unto Him and are all high-souled. Having\\n rendered their lives and souls unto Nārāyana, they have been blessed\\n with their abode in Swetadwipa. Those, who are slain in the encounter\\n with his bow bent by Vishnu—the holder of discus and the preserver of\\n the world, attain to the celestial region. Neither by sacrifice, devout\\n penance, self-control nor excellent gifts may be obtained the celestial\\n region full of bliss.’ Hearing the words of Nārada, the Ten necked demon\\n was worked up with surprise and meditating for some time said ’I shall\\n enter into conflict with him.’ Thereupon inviting Nārada he proceeded to\\n Swetadwipa. Thinking for a long time and being curious to witness that\\n wondrous encounter, Nārada speedily went there. He was ever fond of\\n sport and warfare. Filling all the quarters with dreadful leonine roars\\n Rāvana with all the Rākshasas moved towards the Swetadwipa. After Nārada\\n had reached there, the illustrious Daçānana went to that insular\\n continent beyond even the reach of the celestials. Being struck by the\\n radiant heat of that insular continent, the Puspaka car, of the mighty\\n Rāvana, could not stand there like clouds scattered by the wind. Having\\n arrived at that dreadful insular continent the councillors of the lord\\n of Rākshasas, fearfully said to Rāvana. ’O lord, we are all stupified\\n and beside ourselves with fear. We cannot anyhow stand here; how shall\\n we fight?’ Saying this the Rākshasas fled away into all directions. And\\n Daçānana too sent away his golden car Pushpaka with them. Having thus\\n sent away his chariot and assuming a dreadful figure he alone entered\\n Swetadwipa. At the time of his entering he was seen by the females\\n there. One of them holding him by the hand and smiling said ’Why hast\\n thou come hither? Who art thou? Who is thy father? and what for hast\\n thou come here? Do thou definitely say.’ Hearing those words, O king,\\n Rāvana, in anger said:—’I am the son of the ascetic Visrava, I am Rāvana\\n by name; I have come hither being desirous of fighting; but I do not\\n behold anyone here.’ The vicious-souled Rāvana having said this all the\\n young damsels laughed gently. But one of them, being enraged, took up\\n Rāvana, like a child, as if in sport and hurled him amongst her\\n companions. And addressing another she said:—’Behold, I have caught this\\n black Rāvana, having twenty arms and ten faces, like a small insect.’\\n Thereupon Rāvana, being worn out with hurling, passed from one one hand\\n to another. Being thus hurled the learned and powerful Rāvana, in anger,\\n severely bit the palms of that fair one. Being overwhelmed with pain\\n that damsel let him off. Thereupon, another, taking that Rākshasa-chief,\\n rose up in the welkin. Rāvana, again waxing wroth tore her with his\\n nails. And being left off by that damsel, the terrified night-ranger\\n fell down into the waters of the deep. The females, inhabiting that\\n insular continent again and again in this wise hurled Rāvana. Beholding\\n him thus distressed the highly effulgent Nārada danced in joy and\\n surprise. O thou having long arms, being apprised of this, the\\n vicious-souled Rāvana stole away Sitā with a view to meet death at thy\\n hands. Thou art Nārāyana, holding discus, conch and club; thou hast in\\n thy hands the bow, a lotus, thunder-bolt and other weapons; thou art\\n worshipped of all deities; thou art graced with the mystic mark\\n Sribatsa, adored by all celestials, hast a lotus navel, art a great\\n ascetic, and Hrishikesha declaring fearlessness unto all devotees. Thou\\n hast assumed a human form to bring about the destruction of Rāvana. Dost\\n thou not recognise thyself as Nārāyana? O great one, do not forget\\n thyself; do thou recollect thy real self. The Patriarch Brahmā said that\\n thou art subtler than the subtle. Thou art the the three qualities, the\\n three Vedas and the regions—that of the celestials, of the mortals and\\n the region under the earth. Thy work is manifest in time, past, present\\n and future; thou art the observer of three Vedas and the destroyer of\\n the enemies of the celestials. With thy three steps, thou didst, in the\\n days of yore, traverse the three worlds. Thou wert born of Aditi, as the\\n youngest brother of Indra for binding Bali. Thou art the eternal Vishnu.\\n To extend thy favours unto humanity thou hast been born as man. O\\n foremost of the celestials, the work of the deities hath been\\n accomplished. The vicious Rāvana, with his sons and relatives, hath been\\n slain. The Rishis, having piety for their wealth and all the deities\\n have been pleased. O foremost of gods—all this hath been brought about\\n by thy favours; and the whole universe hath been pacified. Sitā is the\\n very personation of Lakshmi, sprung from earth. It is for thee that she\\n hath been born in the race of Janaka. Bringing her into Lankā Rāvana\\n protected her with care like his mother. Rāma, I have thus related to\\n thee the entire story. Hearing this from the Rishi Sanatkumar, the\\n long-lived Nārada described this unto me. Daçānana, to a letter I\\n followed the instructions of Sanatkumar. Who ever listens to this story\\n at the time of Sraddha, the rice, offered by him, becoming\\n inexhaustible, reaches his manes.\" Hearing this celestial theme, the\\n lotus-eyed Rāma along with his brothers was greatly surprised. And\\n having their eyes expanded with delight the monkeys, with Sugriva, the\\n Rākshasas with Bibhishana, the kings with their councillors, and all\\n other assembled pious Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, and Sudras,\\n delightedly espied Rāma. Thereupon the highly effulgent Agastya said to\\n Rāma:—\"O Rāma, we have all seen thee and been honoured; now we shall\\n depart.\" Saying this, they, being honored, repaired to their respective\\n habitations. The sun set, Rāma, the foremost of men, gave farewell to\\n monkeys and their king and duly went through the Sandhya rite. Gradually\\n night set in and he entered the inner appartment.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 46: '## SECTION XLVII.\\n \\n \\n Kakutstha, knowing himself, being thus duly installed, the first night,\\n enhancing the delight of the citizens, was spent. At dawn, the\\n prisoners, to wake up the king, arrived at the palace. And those\\n songsters, well trained and having a musical voice like the Kinnaras,\\n began to eulogize the heroic king, to the increase of his joy. \"Awake, O\\n gentle hero, increasing Kausalyā’s joy, O foremost of men. Thyself being\\n asleep the whole universe will be laid up with sleep. In prowess thou\\n art like Vishnu, in beauty thou art like two Aswins, in intellect thou\\n art like Vrihaspati and in the capacity of governing thou art like the\\n Patriarch Brahmā. Thy patience equals that of earth, thy effulgence\\n equals that of the sun, thy velocity equals the wind and thy gravity\\n resembles the deep. Thou art stable like a stake, gentle like the moon.\\n No king like thee had flourished before—no other shall follow. O\\n foremost of men, thou art irrepressible, ever pious and engaged in\\n bringing about welfare unto thy subjects. Fame and wealth shall never\\n renounce thee. O Kākutstha, in thee are perpetually stationed grace and\\n wealth.\" Thus did the panegyrists eulogise him in various sweet accents\\n and Rāghava got up. Like unto Hari rising up from the bed of serpents\\n Rāma, thus eulogized, rose up from his bed covered with a a white\\n coverlet. Taking white vessels full of water, thousands of well-trained\\n survitors stood waiting before the high-souled (Rāma). Washing his\\n mouth, being purified and offering oblation unto fire, he entered the\\n holy room of the tutelary deity much honored by the Ikshwākus. And there\\n having worshipped duly the celestials, manes and the Brahmins, he,\\n encircled by men, came to the outer apartment And there arrived the\\n leading priests headed by Vasishtha and ministers all resplendant like\\n unto fire. And there sat around Rāma the Kashatrya kings hailing from\\n various provinces as the celestials sit encircling their lord Indra. The\\n illustrious Bharata, Lakshmana and Satrughna began to worship him and he\\n appeared like a sacrifice conducted by Vedic hymns. And the servants,\\n with their eyes shut, sat around him. The twenty heroic monkeys headed\\n by the highly powerful Sugriva also began to worship him. As the\\n Guhyakas worship Kuvera so Bibhishana, accompanied by four Rākshasas,\\n waited upon him. All those who were advanced in the study of Vedas, born\\n in respectable families, and learned, bowed unto the king lowering their\\n beads. Like unto the celestial-king Indra worshipped by the saints the\\n king Rāma was being perpetually honored by the effulgent saints, kings,\\n monkeys, and Rākshasas. He appeared more beautiful than Indra at that\\n time. And religious themes were recited in that assembly by persons\\n conversant with the knowledge of Puranas.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 47: '## SECTION XLVIII.\\n \\n \\n Thus did the long-armed Rāma spend his days looking into all\\n administrative works relating to the city and provinces. Some days\\n having elapsed, he, with folded hands, said to Janaka, the king of\\n Mithilā, \"Thou art our only refuge—we have been reared by thee and by\\n the help of thy dreadful prowess we have been able to destroy Rāvana. O\\n king, the relation between the families of Ikshwāku and Mithilā, is\\n unequalled and delightful. Taking the jewel, do thou proceed to thy own\\n city and Bharata as a help shall follow thee.\" Saying \"So be it,\" the\\n king Janaka bespoke Rāma \"O king, I have been delighted with seeing thee\\n and thy courteous manners. The jewels collected for me, I do confer upon\\n my two daughters.\" The royal saint Janaka having gone away, Rāma, with\\n folded hands and humbly said to his maternal uncle Kaikeya—\"O king, this\\n kingdom, myself, Bharat and Lakshmana are all at thy disposal. The old\\n king might have been grieved for thy long absence. It therefore behoveth\\n thee, O king, to go there to-day. With immense wealth and various jewels\\n let Lakshmana follow thee.\" Agreeing with his request Yudhājit said, \"O\\n Rāghava, let jewels and wealth be be inexhaustible with thee.\"\\n Thereupon, Rāma, at first saluted and went round him and then Yudhājit,\\n the son of Kekaya, went away to his kingdom in the company of Lakshmana\\n like unto Indra (leaving for home) in the company of Vishnu on the\\n destruction of the Asura Vitra. Having bade adieu unto his maternal\\n uncle Rāma embraced his friend Pratardana, the undaunted king of Kashi\\n and said:—\"Thou hast displayed thy brotherly feelings and delight by\\n making arrangements for my installation in the company of Bharata. O\\n king, do thou now leave for thy city Baranushi, highly picturesque,\\n well-guarded, girt by strong walls on all sides and having\\n well-decorated gate-ways.\" Saying this, Rāma, the descendant of\\n Kākutstha rose up from his seat and embraced him cordially. Having taken\\n farewell from Rāma enhancing Kausalya’s delight, the king of Kashi, with\\n his followers, fearlessly and speedily proceeded to his own city. Having\\n bade adieu to the king of Kashi, Rāma, with a smiling countenance and\\n sweet accents, said to the three hundred assembled kings: \"Being well\\n protected by your own prowess, you have all displayed your great love\\n for me. By your piety, truthfulness, sagacity and strength, the\\n vicious-souled Rāvana hath been slain. Forsooth, I am merely the\\n instrument in the destruction of Rāvana—he hath been slain by your\\n strength. Hearing that Sitā, the daughter of Janaka, had been stolen\\n away from the forest the high-minded Bharata did bring you all—but\\n fortunately you were not constrained to go through miseries. High-minded\\n as you are, you were all prepared for this work. Long since you have\\n come here. I think it better that you should proceed to your respective\\n habitations.\" Whereto the kings, greatly delighted, replied: \"O Rāma, it\\n is by thy good fortune that thou hast come off victorious and been\\n installed on the throne; it is by thy good luck that thou hast got back\\n Sitā and the enemy Daçānana hath been vanquished. That we behold thee, O\\n Rāma, victorious and freed from all enemies, is our great benefit and\\n delight. The encomiums, thou hast showered upon us, are natural with\\n thee. Thou art Rāma, who always pleases people. Thou art worthy of being\\n praised but we do not know how to praise thee. With thy permission we\\n shall now leave for our respective provinces but thou shalt always\\n reside in our hearts. O thou having long arms, O great king, mayst thou\\n have that love for us perpetually that we may find place in thy heart.\"\\n Whereto Rāma replied saying \"So be it.\" Thereupon the kings, highly\\n delighted and desirous of going, bade farewell unto Rāma, with folded\\n palms and being honored by him, left for their respective kingdoms.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",

Those kings, proud and powerful, spoke to one\\n another—\"We did not face Rāvana—the enemy of Rāma; Bharata did uselessly\\n invite us after the destruction of Rāvana. Had they brought us earlier,\\n we would, forsooth, have slain him. We would have, on the other side of\\n the ocean, well protected by the prowess of Rāma and Lakshmana, and\\n freed from all disturbances, fought at pleasure.\" Being thus delighted,\\n all those assembled princes proceeded to their respective kingdoms,\\n dwelling on these and various other topics. And having arrived at their\\n celebrated cities, unscathed, abounding in delighted people, wealth,\\n crops and jewels they sent various presents of jems to Rāma for his\\n satisfaction. Besides this they made over to him innumerable horses,\\n conveyances, infuriated elephants, sandal, excellent ornamants, jewels,\\n pearls, corals, beautiful female servants and various cars. And taking\\n all those jewels, the highly powerful Bharata, Lakshmana and Satrughna\\n returned to their own city. Having arrived at the picturesque city\\n Ayodhyā those foremost of men, made presents of various jewels unto\\n Rāma. Having delightedly accepted those gifts Rāma in return made\\n presents of them unto the successful king Sugriva, Bibhishana and other\\n Rākshasas and monkeys by whose help he had achieved victory. And those\\n highly powerful monkeys and night-rangers wore on their heads and arms\\n those jewels conferred on them by Rāma. Having placed on his lap the\\n long-armed Angada and Hanumān, the mighty car-warrior—the lotus-eyed\\n Rāma said to Sugriva \"Angada is thy good son and Hanumān is thy wise\\n councillor. O Sugriva, these are always engaged in my well-being and in\\n giving me good counsels. For thee, therefore, O king of monkeys, I\\n should honor them in various ways.\" Having said this, the illustrious\\n Rāma took off from his arms valuable ornaments and adorned Angada and\\n Hanumān therewith. Thereupon having welcomed and casting loving looks\\n upon the highly powerful and leading monkeys such as Neela, Kesarin,\\n Kumuda, Gandhamādana, Sushena, Panasa, Mainda, Dwivida, Jāmbavān,\\n Gabāksha, Dhumra, Baleemukha, Prajaghna, Saunāda, Dareemukha, Dadbimuka,\\n Indrajānu and others, he addressed them all in sweet accents,\\n saying:—\"You are all my friends like unto my limbs and brothers. O ye\\n inhabitants of forests, you have saved me from the ocean of danger.\\n Blessed is the king Sugriva and blessed are the friends like\\n yourselves.\" Saying this Rāma, the foremost of men, conferred upon them\\n duly many precious clothes and ornaments and embraced them all. The\\n monkeys lived there all happily feasting on fragrant honey, well-cooked\\n meat and various fruits and roots. In this way they spent more than a\\n month—but it appeared to them as a moment on account of their devotion\\n unto Rāma. He, too also spent his time happily with monkeys assuming\\n shapes at will, the highly powerful Rākshasas and the mighty bears. In\\n this way the delighted monkeys and Rākshasas spent the second winter\\n month.

Thereupon the highly effulgent Rāma, the descendant of Raghu\\n said to Sugriva:—\"O gentle one, proceeding to the city of Kishkindhā,\\n hard to be got at by the celestials and Asuras, do thou reign there\\n undisturbed with thy councillors. O thou having long arms, always look\\n towards Angada, with loving eyes.

Do thou never act to their\\n displeasure.\" Having said this and embraced Sugriva again and again Rāma\\n addressed Bibhishana with sweet accents. \"I know thou art cognizant of\\n piety; the citizens, thy councillors and thy brother Kuvera also love\\n thee; do thou therefore go and govern Lankā piously, O king; never\\n cherish any vile intention; the honest kings always enjoy the earth. And\\n my only request to thee, O king, is that thou mayst with love remember\\n me and Sugriva. Do thou now proceed, divested of sorrow.\" Hearing the\\n words of Rāma, the bears, monkeys and Rākshasas repeatedly exclaimed\\n glory unto Rāma and said \"O Rāma, having long arms, thy understanding\\n resembleth that of the Self-Sprung, thy prowess is equally wonderful and\\n thy beauty is also _par excellence_.\" The monkeys and Rākshasas having\\n said this, Hanumān bowing, said unto Rāma \"May my loving reverence be\\n always in thee, O king; may my devotion unto thee remain unshaken, O\\n hero; and may my mind be not attached unto any other thing. May my life\\n remain in my body as long as the stories of Rāma shall be in currency on\\n earth. Let not this prove otherwise. O foremost of men, O descendant of\\n Raghu, may the Apsarās make me always hear of thy themes. O hero, as the\\n winds scatter the clouds so I shall remove my anxiety by listening to\\n thy nectar-like themes.\" After Hanumān had said this, Rāma rose up from\\n his throne and having embraced Hanumān affectionately said, \"O foremost\\n of monkeys, what thou hast said, shall undoubtedly be carried out into\\n action. As long as my stories shall be current on earth thy fame shall\\n exist and life shall be in thy body. And as long as the world shall\\n exist my themes shall be related. I cannot, even at the sacrifice of my\\n life, release myself from the debts of one good service out of the many,\\n thou hast done for me, monkey; and I shall for ever remain indebted to\\n thee for thy last benefaction. Or let them wear out in me, for men, at\\n the time of danger, become worthy of having their benefits returned.\"\\n Having said this, Rāma took off from his neck a chain set with sapphires\\n brilliant as the rays of the moon and placed it round the neck of\\n Hanumān. Like unto the mountain Sumeru beautified by the rising of the\\n moon on its summit, Hanumān, the foremost of monkeys, appeared graceful\\n with the chain placed on his breast. And hearing the words of Rāghava,\\n the highly powerful monkeys, one by one, saluted Rāma, touching his feet\\n and went away. Both Sugriva and the virtuous-souled Bibhishana embraced\\n Rāma and three of them were beside themselves with tears.

Having received favours thus from the high-souled Rāghava the\\n monkeys went away to their own houses like-unto bodied creatures leaving\\n off their bodies. Thereupon the Rākshasas, bears, monkeys, having bowed\\n unto Rāma, the glory of the Raghu family and with their eyes full of\\n tears consequent upon his separation, went away to the countries from\\n which they had hailed.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",

Having entered the rich Asoka forest\\n abounding in many seats and houses and creepers Rāma sat on an excellent\\n seat, covered with a beautiful coverlet and well constructed. Like unto\\n Purandara with Sachi he took Sitā by the hand, made her sit and drink\\n the wine distilled in the province of Mira. And in no time the servants\\n brought for him well-cooked meat and various fruits. Being inebriete the\\n beautiful Apsarās, well-skilled in the art of singing and dancing, began\\n to dance before Rāma in the company of Kinnaris. The virtuous-souled\\n Rāma, the foremost of those who know how to please, satisfied those\\n beautiful damsels adorned with various ornaments.

Having taken her to\\n the city of Lankā, Rāvana did keep her in the Asoka forest and Sitā was\\n brought under the control of Rākshashes. Still Rāma hath not been worked\\n up with hatred by Sitā. From now we shall also brooke the bad conduct of\\n our wives—for the subjects always tread the footsteps of their King. O\\n King, the subjects thus talk of many things in cities and provinces.\"\\n Hearing those words of Vadra, Rāghava was greatly sorry and asked his\\n friends saying \"Do the subjects thus talk about me?\" Thereupon lowering\\n their heads and saluting him they all said to Rāghava, of a depressed\\n mind—\"For sooth, the subjects thus talk about.\" Thereupon Kākutstha, the\\n slayer of enemies, hearing all those words, dismissed his friends.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 53: '## SECTION LIV.\\n \\n \\n Having sent away his friends and determined what to do, Rāma, the\\n delight of the Rāghus, commanded the warder, who was seated hard by,\\n saying:—\"Do thou speedily bring here, Lakshmana the son of Sumitra and\\n gifted with auspicious marks, the great Bharata and the irrepressible\\n Satrughna.\" Hearing the words of Rāma and placing his folded palms on\\n his head the warder reached the house of Lakshmana and unobstructed\\n entered therein. And having saluted him, with folded palms he said to\\n the high-souled Lakshmana:—\"The King wishes to behold thee—do thou soon\\n go there.\" Thereupon being apprised of Rāghava’s command and saying \"So\\n be it,\" Saumitri ascended his car and went speedily towards Rāma’s\\n abode. Having beheld Lakshmana’s departure the warder humbly went to\\n Bharata and having blessed him with folded hands said:—\"The King wishes\\n to see thee.\" Hearing of the command of Rāma from the warder, the highly\\n powerful Bharata at once got up from his seat and proceeded on foot.\\n Seeing Bharata’s departure the warder speedily went to Satrughna and\\n with folded hands said:—\"Do thou come, O foremost Raghus, the King\\n wisheth to behold thee.\" Hearing the words of the warder Satrughna\\n lowered his head and rising up speedily proceeded to Rāma. Thereupon\\n returning, the warder, with folded hands, communicated unto Rāma, the\\n arrivals of his brothers. So long Rāma was engaged poorly in anxious\\n meditation with his crown bent downwards. Informed of the princes’\\n arrival he commanded the warder, \"Do thou soon bring the princes here.\\n My life depends upon them. They are my dearest life.\" Having obtained\\n Rāma’s command, the princes, clothed in white raiment, entered there,\\n with folded palms and quiescent mind. Having entered there they saw that\\n Rāma’s countenance was shorn of beauty like unto the moon possessed by\\n Rāhu, the setting sun and the withered lotus and his eyes were full of\\n tears. Having approached him quickly, and saluted his feet they\\n anxiously sat there. Thereupon having wiped off his tears and embraced\\n them with his arms he raised up the princes and pressed them to take\\n their seats. Thereupon he said—\"You are mine all; you constitute my\\n life; O princes, I am governing the kingdom gained by you; you are all\\n learned, pious and intelligent. Do ye follow the duties I point out.\"\\n Rāma, the descendant of Kākustha having said this, they, with anxiety\\n and attention, awaited the orders of the king.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 54: '## SECTION LV.\\n \\n \\n The princes were all waiting with a poorly heart when Rāma, with a dried\\n countenance, addressed them, saying:—\"May good betide you—do not act\\n against my desire. Hear, what the citizens have been talking about me\\n and Sitā. The citizens as well as the inhabitants of provinces have been\\n showering censures upon me. I have been pierced to the very vitals by\\n those accusations. I have been born in the illustrious family of the\\n high-souled Ikshwākus. Sitā hath been born also in the holy family of\\n the great Janaka; gentle Lakshmana, thou knowest how in the solitary\\n forest of Dandaka, Sitā was stolen away by Rāvana and how have I slain\\n him. At that time even I was stricken with anxiety regarding Sitā that\\n how I could take her home since she had resided in the house of the\\n Rākshasas. To secure my confidence, Sitā, in your very presence, entered\\n fire. At that time, O Saumitri, fire, carrying sacrificial oblations and\\n the wind of the sky declared Sitā’s innocence before the celestials. In\\n the presence of all the Rishis and gods, the Sun and Moon announced the\\n innocence of the daughter of Janaka. Indra, the king of the celestials,\\n himself handed over the chaste Sitā unto me in the island of Lankā. My\\n mind knoweth Sitā as chaste for ever. So, at that time I came back to\\n Ayodhyā with Sitā. But now a great sorrow consequent upon the censure of\\n the citizens and villagers hath pierced my heart. He, who is notorious\\n on this earth and as long as that notoriety remains current, is classed\\n amongst the vile. Even the celestials speak ill of bad name—whereas fame\\n is adored in all the regions. Therefore the high-souled exert their best\\n to acquire reputation. O foremost of men, what to speak of the daughter\\n of Janaka—I can even renounce my life and yourselves in fear of a bad\\n name. Do ye therefore perceive into what great abyss of sorrow and\\n ill-fame I have fallen. Up to this time I have never experienced such a\\n mighty grief. Do thou, O Lakshmana, next morning, ascending the car\\n driven by Sumantra, take away Sitā to another country. There is a\\n picturesque hermitage of the high-souled Vālmiki situate on the Tamasā\\n on the Other side of the river Ganges. Do thou, O delight of Raghus,\\n soon come back, leaving behind Sitā in that lovely place; Do thou carry\\n out my words. Do thou not speak anything regarding Sitā’s banishment, O\\n Saumitri, if dost thou request me to desist from this, it shall be the\\n more unpleasant unto me. For my life and arms, do ye not proffer any\\n request unto me regarding this, If so, you shall only endanger my\\n well-being and I shall ever regard you as my enemies. If you obey my\\n behests, do ye honor my words now. Do ye take away Sitā from here. Ere\\n this Sitā had communicated her intention of beholding the hermitages of\\n ascetics on the banks of the Ganges. Let that desire of hers be now\\n satisfied.\" While saying this, the eyes of the virtuous-souled Rāma were\\n covered with tears. Sighing hard like unto an elephant, he, with a heart\\n stricken with grief, departed to his own quarter in the company of his\\n brothers.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 55: '## SECTION LVI.\\n \\n \\n The night being over, Lakshmana, with a poor heart and dried\\n countenance, addressed Sumantra, saying:—\"O charioteer, do thou soon\\n yoke quick-coursing steeds to an excellent chariot, and for Sitā place\\n an excellent seat on the car. At the command of the King, I shall take\\n Sitā to the hermitage of the ascetics ever engaged in pious actions. Do\\n thou soon bring the chariot here.\" Obeying the mandate, and bringing a\\n beautiful and holy car drawn by first-rate steeds and having excellent\\n seats, he said to Saumitri, the enhancer of friends’ honor \"O lord, here\\n is the chariot ready—do thou now satisfy thine desire.\" Hearing the\\n words of Sumantra, Lakshmana, the foremost of men, approached Sitā in\\n the inner apartment and said:—\"O queen, thou didst request the king to\\n show thee the hermitage—the king too did promise—he hath now commanded\\n me to take thee there. Do thou therefore follow me, at the command of\\n the king. I shall, at his behest, take thee to the forest where dwell\\n many an ascetic.\" Hearing the words of the high-souled Lakshmana, Jānaki\\n attained to excessive delight and became anxious to go. Taking various\\n jewels and costly clothes she said to Lakshmana on the eve of her\\n departure—\"I shall confer these ornaments, these costly clothes and\\n riches on the female ascetics.\" Saying \"We shall do the same,\" he made\\n Sitā ascend the car and remembering Rāma’s command proceeded, being\\n carried by quick-coursing steeds. Thereupon Sitā said to Lakshmana, the\\n enhancer of prosperity:—\"O descendent of Raghu, I behold many\\n inauspicious omens. My right eye and body are trembling. My mind is\\n growing depressed. It is stricken with anxiety and I have accordingly\\n grown restless. I behold the earth as void of all happiness. O thou fond\\n of brothers—hath thy brother met with any calamity? Are all my\\n mothers-in-law and subjects well?\" Saying this Sitā, with folded hands,\\n began to pray unto gods. Hearing this Lakshmana bowed unto her touching\\n the ground with his crown, and though greatly sorry, said as if\\n delighted \"All well.\" Thereupon having arrived at the hermitage situate\\n on the banks of Gomati Lakshmana spent the night there. Thereupon at\\n dawn he rose up and asked the charioteer to get the chariot ready,\\n saying, \"Like unto the powerful Mahādeva we shall hold the waters of the\\n Bhāgirathi on our head.\" Thereupon Sumantra yoked the horses, gifted\\n with the fleet course of the mind, to the chariot and with folded hands\\n said to Sitā. \"Do thou ascend the car.\" According to the request of the\\n intelligent charioteer, Sitā, with Lakshmana, ascended that excellent\\n conveyance. In no time the daughter of Janaka, having expansive eyes,\\n arrived at the banks of the Ganges removing all sins, Reaching the\\n currents of Bhāgirathi before noon Lakshmana, on beholding her, cried\\n aloud. Thereupon beholding Lakshmana thus distressed, Sitā, conversant\\n with piety, waxing anxious said. \"Why art thou weeping, Lakshmana? I\\n have reached the banks of Janhavi, for which I have so long desired. So\\n this is the time for rejoicing and do not give me pain at this time. O\\n foremost of men, thou dost spend thine days and nights in the company of\\n Rāma, Thou hast left him for two days only—art thou sorry for this?\\n Lakshmana—Rāma is also dearer than my life—but I am not so sorry—do thou\\n not be therefore overwhelmed with grief. Do thou take me to the other\\n side of the Ganges so that I may behold the ascetics and confer upon\\n them clothes and ornaments. Thereupon saluting them duly and spending a\\n night we shall return to the capital. I am also anxious to sec Rāma,\\n having eyes like lotus petals, breast like that of a lion and foremost\\n of men.\" Hearing the words of Sitā and wiping his beautiful eyes,\\n Lakshmana, the slayer of enemies, sent for boatmen. As soon as they were\\n called, with folded hands they said. \"The boat is ready.\" Having then\\n brought a boat to cross the holy Ganges Lakshmana, with a quiescent\\n mind, took her to the other side.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 56: '## SECTION LVII.\\n \\n \\n Having at first conducted Sitā to the spacious and well decorated boat\\n plied by fishermen Lakshmana himself got up. Thereupon he ordered\\n Sumantra to wait there with the chariot, and being beside himself with\\n sorrow ordered the sailors to move on. Thereupon having reached the\\n other side of Bhāgirathi, Lakshmana, with subdued voice and folded\\n palms, said to Sitā—\"O daughter of the king of Videha, this hath pierced\\n my heart like a dart, that my brother, by making me the instrumental of\\n this action hath made me the object of censure in the world. The death\\n and the pain consequent upon it are better than the action I am engaged\\n in. Be thou propitiated, O beautiful damsel, do not hold me responsible\\n for this.\" Saying this, the humble Lakshmana began to weep and pray for\\n death. Beholding him thus overwhelmed, Sitā said \"What is the matter,\\n Lakshmana? I do not understand anything, Do thou speak out everything\\n plainly unto me. I find thee beside thyself (with grief); is it all well\\n with the kingdom? In the name of the king, do thou give out unto me, the\\n cause of thy sorrow.\" Sitā having addressed him thus, Lakshmana, with a\\n poorly heart and suppressed tone, said \"O worshipful queen, I have kept\\n within my heart all those words, which the king said, before he entered\\n his palace, rendered sorry and impatient on hearing in the assembly the\\n report of censure regarding thee, O daughter of king Janaka. All those\\n words are indeed above description and so I desist. I only say so much,\\n that afraid of the calumny of the citizens he hath renounced thee\\n although thy purity was sufficiently proved before me. But for that, do\\n not consider thyself in any way guilty. Rāma hath commanded me to leave\\n thee near the hermitage on the pretext of satisfying thine desire as\\n thou art big with a child. Do not uselessly give vent to sorrow any\\n more. There is the holy hermitage of the saints on the banks of Jānhavi.\\n There lives Vālmiki, the foremost of saints, a great friend of our sire\\n Daçaratha. O daughter of Janaka, approaching that high-souled saint, do\\n thou spend thy days happily keeping Rāma always in thy mind. Do thou\\n satisfy the deities, O chaste damsel.

       " 57: '## SECTION LVIII.\\n \\n \\n Hearing the ruthless words of Lakshmana, the daughter of Janaka, greatly\\n sorry, fell down on earth. And remaining senseless for some time, Sitā,\\n with her eyes full of tears said to Lakshmana:—\"Forsooth, O Lakshmana,\\n the great Dispenser hath created this body to suffer miseries; and all\\n my afflictions are manifest in form to-day. Methinks; I committed a\\n mighty iniquity in my pristine existence or brought about separation\\n between a husband and wife and for that Rāma hath renounced me albeit I\\n am pure and chaste. O son of Sumitrā, the affliction of residing in the\\n forest appeared to me as pleasure ere this for I knew that I would be\\n able to serve Rāma’s feet. But how shall I, O gentle one, live in the\\n hermitage being divorced from all my kith and kin? And being afflicted\\n to whom shall I express my sorrow? What reply shall I offer unto the\\n ascetics when they shall ask me ’Child; why hath the high-souled Rāghava\\n renounced thee? What sin hast thou committed?’ O Saumitri, shall I just\\n renounce my life in the waters of Jāhnavi? But I desist from this for it\\n shall bring about the termination of my husband’s race. O Saumitri, do\\n thou carry out the orders thou hast received. By renouncing this\\n wretched wight do thou satisfy the King’s orders. But hear, what I say.\\n Without making any distinction, do thou, in my name, with folded hands,\\n bow unto my mothers-in-law and then ask the well-being of the kingdom.\\n Thereupon saluting the pious King do thou address him, in my name,\\n saying:—’Thou knowest, O Rāghava, that Sitā is pure, ever devoted unto\\n thee and engaged in thy well-being. She knows it full well, that afraid\\n of a bad name thou hast renounced her. It is her duty to put a stop to\\n thy ill-name and censure; for thou art her excellent refuge.’ Do thou\\n tell further-more that king established in righteousness to treat the\\n citizens as his brothers, to acquire piety by protecting his subjects\\n duly—for this is the greatest morality and by this may be acquired\\n excellent fame. Tell him that I am not sorry for my person—my greatest\\n sorrow is that the citizens have vilified me. Husband is a woman’s\\n god—her friend and spiritual guide. It is proper therefore to work out\\n husband’s well-being even at the sacrifice of life. Do thou, O\\n Lakshmana, communicate it in short unto Rāma, in my name; Do thou go now\\n and behold the signs of pregnancy are manifest in me.\" Sitā having said\\n this, Lakshmana, with a bewildered heart, saluted her touching the\\n ground with his head, he could not speak more. Thereupon bewailing aloud\\n and circumambulating her, he, meditating a little, said. \"What art thou\\n speaking unto me, O worshipful dame? O thou having no sin, up to this\\n time I have not seen any portion of thy beautiful person but feet. This\\n is a solitary forest and besides the worshipful Rāma, is not present\\n here—under these circumstances how can I cast looks upon thee?\" Having\\n addressed Sitā in this wise Lakshmana again sent for a boat and\\n ascending it ordered the boatmen to go. Thereupon having reached the\\n other side and being beside himself with sorrow and grief he speedily\\n ascended the car. And casting his looks behind while proceeding he\\n espied that Sitā, on the other side of the Ganges, was roving wildly\\n like one having none to look after her. Looking again and again when\\n Sitā saw that Lakshmana and the chariot have gone beyond the range of\\n her vision, she became overwhelmed with anxiety and grief. Being sunk in\\n grief and pressed down with the weight of sorrow on not beholding Rāma,\\n the foremost of the illustrious, the chaste Sitā began to cry aloud in\\n the forest resounded with the notes of peacocks.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 58: '## SECTION LIX.\\n \\n \\n Beholding Sitā thus wailing, the sons of the Rishis there speedily\\n approached the great Vālmiki, well-established in asceticism. And\\n saluting him they all communicated unto him Sitā’s bewailings and said,\\n \"O great sir, we do not know the wife of what great man, beautiful like\\n the very Lakshmi, and not seen before, is crying aloud very poorly? It\\n is better that thou shouldst see her once. That beautiful damsel, like a\\n goddess falling from heaven being bewildered, is waiting on the banks of\\n the river. We saw her alone crying aloud being overwhelmed with sorrow\\n and grief as if she had none to look after her. A damsel like her should\\n not be subject to such a condition. She did not appear to us to be a\\n woman. Do thou receive her duly. She is near the hermitage and so hath\\n come to seek thy shelter. O illustrious Sir, she is on the look out for\\n a protector—do thou protect her.\" The pious Vālmiki could perceive every\\n thing by virtue of his asceticism; and ascertaining the truth of the\\n words of the Rishi boys by the power of his understanding, he, with\\n quick steps, approached Sitā. And the disciples followed that\\n high-minded ascetic. Thereupon proceeding a little on foot with Arghya\\n in his hands, the wise Vālmiki reached the banks of the river and saw\\n that Rāghava’s spouse was bewailing like a helpless woman. Having\\n gladdened a little the aggrieved Sitā by virtue of his own effulgence\\n the great ascetic Vālmiki addressed her in following sweet accents. \"O\\n chaste damsel, thou art the daughter-in-law of Daçaratha, the beloved\\n wife of Rāma and the daughter of Janaka; thy coming here is auspicious.\\n I am apprized, by virtue of asceticism and meditation, of the object of\\n thy coming here. O great lady, I am also fully aware that thou art by\\n all means chaste. In fact I am conscious of all the incidents in the\\n three worlds. By the eyes of asceticism, I perceive, O daughter of\\n Janaka, that thou art innocent. Thou hast come under my shelter, O\\n Vaidehi—be thou consoled. O child, the pious ascetics live around my\\n hermitage. They shall daily take care of thee as their daughter. Do thou\\n accept this Arghya now, and confiding in me do thou remove thy grief. Be\\n not sorry for anything; consider that thou hast come to thy own home.\"\\n Hearing the wonderful words of the great ascetic, Sitā humbly touched\\n his feet and said \"Thy desire shall be fulfilled.\" Saying this, she,\\n with folded hands, followed the ascetic. Beholding the great ascetic and\\n Sitā approach, the wives of the Rishis, delighted neared them and\\n said:—\" Do thou come, O foremost of Rishis, thou hast arrived here after\\n a long time. We all bow unto thee—do thou order what we shall do.\"\\n Hearing their words the great Vālmiki replied in worthy accents—\"This\\n Sitā is the wife of the intelligent Rāma, the daughter-in-law of\\n Daçaratha and the daughter of Janaka. She has now come to our hermitage.\\n She is chaste and innocent, still her husband hath renounced her. So we\\n should all protect her. She is worthy of your reverence—specially while\\n such is the order of mine—your preceptor.

       " 59: '## SECTION LX.\\n \\n \\n Beholding the great ascetic Vālmiki thus conducting Sitā into his own\\n hermitage Lakshmana’s heart was bewildered with grief. Thereupon he said\\n to the expert charioteer Sumantra. \"Do thou perceive Rāma’s grief\\n consequent upon the separation from Sitā. His spouse—the daughter of\\n Janaka, is perfectly pure; what can be more painful than that Rāma is\\n living alone having renounced her? It is clear unto me, O Sumantra, that\\n this separation of Rāma, hath been brought about by the influence of\\n destiny—for it is hard to get over accident. Even that Rāma, who, when\\n enraged, is capable of slaying the celestials, Gandharvas, Asuras and\\n Rākshasas, hath been engaged in the worship of destiny. Formerly did\\n Rāma go through miseries, residing in the forest of Dandaka, at the\\n command of his sire for fourteen years. But this banishment of Sitā\\n appears to me as exceedingly painful and most ruthless. O charioteer,\\n the opinion of the citizens is by no means just; consequently what shall\\n we gain by performing such a bad action for fame as the exile of Sitā?\"\\n Hearing those words of Lakshmana, the wise Sumantra reverentially\\n replied:—\"Be not aggrieved for Sitā, O Saumitri. Formerly in the\\n presence of thy sire the Brahmananas related this account of Sitā’s\\n exile. Rāma shall be deprived of all happiness and be separated from his\\n dear wife; what more, the virtuous-souled Rāma, having long arms, shall,\\n under the influence of time, renounce thee, Sitā, Satrughna and Bharata.\\n O Lakshmana, when Durbasa was addressed by the king Daçaratha as to thy\\n future he replied in the above way. I have told thee the same. Do thou\\n not communicate this unto Satrughna, Bharata or any body. O foremost of\\n men, Durbasa said this unto Daçaratha before me, Vasishtha and other\\n great men. Hearing the words of Rishi, Daçaratha, the foremost of men,\\n said unto me, ’O charioteer, do not reveal this secret to any body.’ O\\n gentle one, it is not proper by any means to falsify the words of the\\n king Daçaratha. I shall always, very carefully, carry out his orders. It\\n is not proper to reveal this mystery before thee. Still I do so for thy\\n curiosity hath been greatly excited. Though this mystery was\\n communicated formerly by the king Daçaratha and though it is not proper\\n to reveal it to any body, still I express it before thee that thou mayst\\n not, on hearing it, be worked up with sorrow; for destiny is hard to be\\n got over. And it is by the influence of that destiny that thou hast met\\n with such a sorrow and grief. However, do thou not reveal this secret\\n unto Satrughna and Bharata.\" Hearing these grave and important words of\\n Sumantra, Lakshmana ordered him to relate.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 60: '## SECTION LXI.\\n \\n \\n Being thus requested by the high-souled Lakshmana, Sumantra began to\\n reveal the mystery of Durbāsā’s account \"In the days of yore the great\\n ascetic Durbāsā, the son of Atri, resided for a year in the holy\\n hermitage of Vasishtha. At that time thy sire, the highly effulgent and\\n illustrious Daçaratha, with a view to see his high-souled priest\\n Vasishtha, repaired there. He saw the great ascetic Durbāsā, burning\\n like the sun in his effulgence, seated on the right hand side of\\n Vasishtha. Thereupon he humbly saluted those two leading ascetics. And\\n they too, welcoming him, received him duly with seat, water to wash\\n feet, Arghya, fruits and roots. Then he lived there in the company of\\n the ascetics. Thereupon during the noon, all those ascetics, seated\\n there, began to dwell upon various pleasant topics. During an interval\\n Daçaratha, with folded hands and uplifted arms, said to the high-souled\\n son of Atri—Durbāsā, having asceticism for his wealth. ’O illustrious\\n Sir, how long shall my family remain in existence? What is the extent of\\n the lease of life granted to Rāma and my other sons? How long shall the\\n descendants of Rāma live? And what shall be the end of my race? Do thou\\n relate all this unto me.’ Hearing the words of the king Daçaratha the\\n highly effulgent Durbāsā, replied:—’Hear, the early history, O king.\\n During the encounter between the celestials and Asuras, the demons,\\n being remonstrated with by the celestials sought shelter of the wife of\\n Vrigu—thy priest. Vrigu’s wife having promised them help they lived\\n there fearlessly. Having beheld the demons thus helped by Vriju’s wife,\\n Hari, the king of the celestials, enraged, chopped off her head with his\\n sharp discus. And angry on beholding his wife slain, Vrigu, imprecated a\\n curse on Vishnu, the slayer of enemies’ race, saying—\"Being beside\\n thyself with anger thou hast slain my wife, not worthy of being killed;\\n therefore, O Janārddana, thou shalt be born in the region of mortals.\\n And there thou shalt remain separated from thy spouse for many long\\n years.\" Having imprecated this curse, Vrigu was greatly pained and being\\n propitiated by his adoration, Vishnu, fond of disciples, said: \"Having\\n slain Rāvana and others, I shall be, for the behoof of mankind, subject\\n to this imprecation.\" O bestower of kings, the highly effulgent Vishnu,\\n thus imprecated by Vrigu in the days of yore, hath been born as thy son\\n in this birth and hath been celebrated under the appellation of Rāma. O\\n conferrer of honors, for sooth shall Rāma partake of the fruits of\\n Vrigu’s curse. He shall reign in Ayodhyā for a long time. All his\\n followers shall be happy and prosperous. Having reigned for eleven\\n thousand years Rāma shall repair to the region of Brahmā. None shall be\\n able to vanquish him. He shall celebrate many a horse-sacrifice with\\n profuse gifts and shall establish many royal families. He shall beget on\\n Sitā two sons.’ Having thus related unto Daçaratha the past and future\\n of his family the highly effulgent great ascetic Durbāsā became silent.\\n He being silent—the great King Daçaratha, having bowed unto the two\\n high-souled ascetics, again returned to his city Ayodhyā. I had heard\\n there all these words of the great ascetic Durbāsā. Up to this time they\\n are lying in my heart.

But the high-souled Lakshmana\\n became greatly sorry stricken with the thought as to what he should\\n relate on approaching the feet of Rāma.

Therefore attachment unto wife, sons, friends and\\n riches is not proper, for surely shall be brought about separation with\\n them. Whilst thou canst control thyself and thy mind, shouldst thou not\\n be able to bear this trifling pain of separation? Leading men like\\n thyself are never overwhelmed by all these things.

I\\n have heard, O foremost of men, that there lived in the days of yore a\\n highly illustrious, truthful and pure-minded king, ever devoted unto the\\n Brāhmanas, by the name of Nriga. Once on a time at the sacred pilgrimage\\n of Pushpaka that king conferred upon the Brāhmanas one _Koti_ of kine\\n with calves adorned with golden ornaments. Accidentally on that\\n occasion, a cow with calf belonging to a poor Brahman, living upon low\\n means, was given away along with other kine. Undergoing hunger and\\n thirst, the master of that lost cow travelled for a long time in many\\n places in search of it. Thereupon having reached the province of\\n Kanakhal he espied his own cow in the house of a Brāhmana. The cow was\\n well kept and the young one was grown up. Thereupon the Brahman called\\n the cow by the name given by him saying ’Savalā, come.’ The cow heard\\n that and recognizing the voice of the Brahman followed him. And he\\n preceded her burning like fire. And the Brāhmana, in whose house the cow\\n so long remained, speedily pursued her and approaching the ascetic said.\\n ’This cow is mine. The king Nriga conferred this upon me.’ So there\\n arose a great quarrel between the two learned Brāhmanas. And thus\\n quarreling they both approached him who had given away the cow. And\\n though they waited for a long time at the gate they did not obtain\\n permission to enter the palace. Thereat both of them were greatly\\n engraged and imprecated dreadful curses, saying ’Since thou hast not\\n granted us an interview though we have been waiting here for a long\\n time, thou shalt, by our curse, remain invisible, being a lizard. Thou\\n shalt in this state live in a den for many hundred and thousand years.\\n When Vishnu assuming a human person shall be born in the Vasudeva family\\n of Yadavas and enhance their glory he shall liberate thee from the\\n curse. Immediately before the advent of the Kali Yuga the Rishi Nara\\n Nārāyana gifted with great prowess shall descend upon earth to relieve\\n her of the burden.’ Having thus imprecated the curse upon the king the\\n Rishis became silent. The cow was old and weak so they both, with mutual\\n consent, conferred that upon another Brahman. O Lakshmana, the king\\n Nriga is still suffering from that dreadful curse. It is the king’s\\n folly that is manifest from the mutual disagreement of the workers. Do\\n thou bring them all speedily to me who have come for business. For,\\n sooth shall the kings profit by the just administration. Do thou\\n therefore go in person, O Lakshmana and see who hath come for business.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 63: '## SECTION LXIV.\\n \\n \\n Hearing the words of the highly effulgent Rāma, Lakshmana, conversant\\n with discriminative knowledge, replied with folded hands, saying \"O\\n Kākutstha, it is for a very simple folly that the two Brāhmanas\\n imprecated that Curse upon the king Nriga, dreadful as the rod of Yama.\\n May I ask thee, O foremost of men, what did that King say unto the\\n Brahmans when he was thus imprecated?\" Whereto Rāma replied saying:—\"O\\n gentle one, hear, what the king Nriga said when imprecated. Hearing of\\n the departure of the Brāhmanas he sent for his priest, minister, the\\n citizens and subjects and filled with sorrow said:—’Do ye all hear\\n attentively my words. Having imprecated a dreadful curse upon me the\\n jolly saint Nārada and the ascetic Parvata have speedily, like the wind,\\n repaired to the region of Brahmā. Do ye therefore, even today, place the\\n prince Vasu on the throne, and let the architects prepare a pleasant den\\n for me. Living therein I shall waste the curse of the Brahmans. Let the\\n architects dig one den to protect me against the rains, one against the\\n affliction of the winter and one against the distresses of summer. Let\\n them enhance the picturesqueness of those dens by planting many trees\\n having profuse branches and fruits and flowers. As long as time shall\\n not change so long I shall spend my days happily in the den. For half a\\n league on all sides around me let flower trees be planted.’ Having made\\n those arrangements and placed Vasu on the throne the king Nriga\\n said:—’Do not swerve from the path of morality, O my son, and do thou\\n duly govern the subjects according to the custom of the Kshatryas. Thou\\n hast seen, with thine own eyes, the curse that the Brāhmanas have given\\n me being enraged for a very trifling folly of mine. Do thou not repent\\n for me. My son, time is the lord of happiness and sorrow; it is by the\\n influence of time that I have fallen into such a disaster. Creatures\\n must meet with what is kept in store by destiny; they must go where they\\n are bound for and they must acquire what is set apart for them. Pristine\\n actions are the root of all these; so, be not sorry, O my son.’ O\\n foremost of men, having given this advice unto his son, the highly\\n illustrious king Nriga proceeded to live in the sweet fragrant den.\\n Having entered the den filled with many jewels the high-souled king\\n began to spend his days in the satisfaction of the curse imprecated by\\n the two Brāhmanas.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 64: '## SECTION LXV.\\n \\n \\n \"I have thus given unto thee an account of the curse imprecated on\\n Nriga. Listen, if dost thou wish to hear of any other theme.\" Rāma\\n having said this Lakshmana replied:—\"I am not satiated with the account\\n of those wonderful stories, O king.\" Hearing the reply of Laksmana,\\n Rāma, the descendant of Ikshwāku, began again with themes instinct with\\n morality:—\"There lived a highly pious and powerful king by the name of\\n Nimi. He was the twelfth of Ikshwāku’s sons. That powerful king made a\\n picturesque city like that of the celestials near the hermitage of\\n Gautama. The name of that beautiful city was Vaijayanta and the highly\\n illustrious royal saint used to live there. Having thus reared a highly\\n picturesque city he thought of worshipping the deity by celebrating a\\n sacrifice for the satisfaction of his sire. Having thus resolved and\\n invited his sire Ikshwāku the son of Manu, he first welcomed the\\n celestial saint. Nimi the descendant of Ikshwāku, then welcomed the\\n saints Atri, Angiras and Vrigu having asceticism for their wealth.\\n Thereupon Vasishtha said to Nimi, the foremost of royal saints—’I have\\n already been engaged by Indra. Do thou therefore wait as long as his\\n sacrifice is not finished there.’ After the departure of Vasishtha the\\n great Gautama engaged in the satisfaction of Vasistha’s duties. And the\\n high-souled Vasishtha too engaged in Indra’s sacrifice. On the other\\n hand having united all the Brahmans the great king began to celebrate\\n the sacrifice extending over five thousand years near his city by the\\n side of the Himalaya. Thereupon having finished the sacrifice of Indra\\n there came to the King, the blameless and the illustrious Rishi\\n Vashishtha. Finding Gautama engaged in his room he was exceedingly\\n enraged. Thereupon he waited there for some time to see the King. On\\n that day the royal saint Nimi was deeply asleep. And not beholding the\\n King the high-souled Vasishtha was greatly angry and said:—’Since thou\\n hast, O King, engaged another neglecting me, thy body shall remain\\n senseless.’ Thereupon hearing the curse of Vasishtha, the king got up.\\n There beside himself with ire he said—’I was unconscious in sleep—still\\n soiled with anger thou hast hurled the fiery curse against me like the\\n second rod of Yama. Therefore, O ascetic, thy person shall remain\\n senseless for a long time.’ That king and the ascetic having thus\\n imprecated one another under the influence of anger, they immediately\\n were deprived of their bodies.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 65: '## SECTION LXVI.\\n \\n \\n Hearing the words of the effulgent Rāma, Lakshmana, the slayer of\\n enemies, said with folded hands:—\"Having thus cast off their bodies how\\n did that Brahman worshipped of the celestials and the king regain them?\"\\n Having been thus accosted by Lakshmana, Rāma, the descendant of\\n Ikshwākus and the foremost of men, replied:—\"Having renounced their\\n persons both Nimi and the pious Vasishtha, having asceticism for their\\n wealth, were metamorphosed into air. Thereupon being thus deprived of\\n his body the highly effulgent and great ascetic Vasishtha went to the\\n Patriarch Brahmā with the object of acquiring from him another. Being\\n merged in the air, he, conversant with religion, bowed unto his father\\n and said:—’O illustrious god of gods! O thou lotus-sprung! By the\\n imprecation of Nimi I have been now deprived of my body and been\\n converted into air. O lord, the state of being bodiless is highly\\n painful to all. The bodiless cannot perform any work; do thou,\\n therefore, by thy favour, grant me another body.’ Whereto the\\n self-sprung Brahmā, of unmitigated prowess, replied. ’O great one, do\\n thou enter into the vital energy of Mitra and Varuna; and even then, O\\n foremost of twice-born ones, thou shalt not be born of a woman and being\\n greatly pious shalt attain to the rank of a patriarch.’ The Patriarch\\n Brahmā having said this, Vasishtha, saluting and circumambulating him,\\n repaired to the region of Varuna. At that time Mitra in conjunction with\\n Varuna was reigning in Varuna’s kingdom being worshipped by all\\n celestials. Meanwhile encircled by her mates the leading Apsarā arrived\\n there at her pleasure. Beholding the frolicsome and beautiful Urvasi,\\n Varuna attained to an excess of delight. Thereupon he expressed his\\n intention of living with that queen of Apsarās, having a moon-like\\n countenance and lotus-eyes. Thereat Urvasi, with folded hands, said—’O\\n lord of celestials, Mitra himself has already invited me for the same.’\\n Being stricken by desire Varuna said to Urvasi ’I shall discharge my\\n vital energy into this pot if thou dost not wish to live with me.’\\n Hearing those sweet words of the Patriarch Varuna, Urvasi was highly\\n pleased and said:—’Do what thou hast said. Now my body is under the\\n possession of Mitra—but my mind is attached unto thine and thou art\\n equally attached unto me.’ Urvasi having said this, Varuna discharged\\n his vital energy into the pot. Thereupon Urvasi approached Mitra. And\\n thereat highly enraged he said to her ’I invited thee first; O thou of\\n vicious actions, why hast thou, renouncing me, secured another. For this\\n vile action, thou shalt, by my curse live in the land of mortals for\\n some time. The royal saint Puruvarā, the king of Kasi, is the son of\\n Budha. Do thou go to him, thou of a vicious intellect; he shall be thy\\n husband.’ Thereupon being thus placed under the influence of curse\\n Urvasi went to Puruvarā, The king Puruvarā was the begotten son of\\n Budha. He reigned in the foremost of cities Pratishtaro. He begot on\\n Urvasi a highly powerful and beautiful son by the name of Ayu. Nahusha,\\n powerful as Indra, was the son of Ayu. When Indra, the king of the\\n celestials, was assailed with thunderbolt by the Asura Vitra, Nahusha\\n governed his kingdom for a hundred thousand years. In this wise Urvasi,\\n having beautiful teeth, eyes and brow, remained on earth for many years\\n and then returned to the region of Indra after the period of curse had\\n been over.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 66: '## SECTION LXVII.\\n \\n \\n Hearing this wonderful and heavenly theme Lakshmana was highly gratified\\n and said to Rāma \"O Kākuthstha, how did that twice-born one worshipped\\n by the celestials and the king regain their bodies, after being\\n bodiless?\" Hearing the words of Lakshmana, Rāma, having truth for his\\n prowess, began to relate the story of Vasishtha. \"O foremost of Raghus,\\n there sprang up two foremost Brahmin saints, from the vital energy\\n discharged by the high-souled Mitra and Varuna into the pot. At first\\n therefrom rose up the illustrious Rishi Agastya and saying ’I am not\\n thine son’ went away leaving Mitra. Before the vital energy of Varuna\\n was thrown into the pot Mitra discharged his own on Urvasi’s account\\n which was the source of Agastya’s birth. Into the pot in which Mitra’s\\n energy was discharged Varuna also put his own, and both the energies\\n were mixed up. Thereupon after some time from the energies of both Mitra\\n and Varuna sprang up the effulgent Vasishtha—the priest of Ikshwāku. O\\n gentle one, the highly effulgent Ikshwāku appointed that blameless Rishi\\n as the priest of out family as soon as he was born. I have thus\\n described to you the story of Vasishtha’s birth possessing a wonderful\\n body. Hear now what befell the king Nimi. And beholding the king Nimi\\n bodiless the intelligent Rishi initiated him into the rites of\\n sacrifice. And those leading twice-born ones, with assembled citizens\\n and servants, began to protect that body with unguents, garlands and\\n clothes. Thereupon at the end of the sacrifice Vrigu said ’O king, I am\\n propitiated with thee; I shall restore thee to senses.’ Thereupon the\\n celestials, highly pleased, addressed the consciousness of Nimi saying\\n ’O royal saint, do thou accept boons; where shall we place thy\\n consciousness?’ Thereupon being addressed by the celestials the\\n consciousness said ’I may live in the eyes of the celestials.’ They\\n agreed to it and said ’O lord of earth, for thee, their eyes shall be\\n influenced within a moment, The exhaustion that their eyes shall\\n experience on account of thy moving about as the air, shall be removed\\n within this moment.’ Having said this the celestials repaired to their\\n respective quarters and the high-souled Rishis having conveyed Nimi’s\\n body to the sacrificial ground and dedicated it as an eddy began to\\n churn it with great energy accompanied by incantations. They being thus\\n engaged in churning the eddy for the purpose of having a son of Nimi\\n there sprang up a son of devout austerities. He was called Mithi for he\\n originated from _Manthana_; he was called Janma for his having sprung up\\n from _Janan_ and _Vaideha_ from having been born from Videha. In this\\n wise Janaka, the first king of Videhas, was born. His other name was\\n Mithi and his family were celebrated as Maithilas. O gentle one, I have\\n thus related unto thee the wondrous births, in consequence of the curse,\\n of the great ascetic Vasishtha and the royal saint Nimi.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 67: '## SECTION LXVIII.\\n \\n \\n Rāma having said this, Lakshmana, the slayer of enemies, burning in his\\n native effulgence, said:—\"O foremost of kings, this ancient account of\\n the ascetic Vasishtha and the king Nimi is highly surprising and\\n wonderful. But Nimi is a Kshatriya king and a hero—besides although\\n initiated he did not forgive the high-souled Vasishtha.\" Being thus\\n accosted Rāma, the Kshatriya-chief, said to the effulgent Lakshmana\\n conversant with all Sastras—\"O hero, forgiveness is not to be seen in\\n all men. O Sauinitri, do thou hear attentively, the unbearable anger\\n which was forgiven by the king Yayāti resorting to the quality of\\n goodness. Yayāti, the enhancer or the prosperity of cities, was the son\\n of Nahusha. He had two beautiful wives, one of whom was Sarmishthā,\\n grand daughter of Aditi, the daughter of Brishaparva. She was the more\\n beloved of the two; his other spouse was Devajāni, grand daughter of\\n Usanas. She was not liked by her husband. Both of them gave birth to a\\n son each and both the sons were beautiful and attentive. Puru was born\\n of Sarmishtha and Yadu of Devajāni. Puru was the favourite son of the\\n king, both on account of his mother and of his personal graces. Thereat\\n Yadu, greatly sorry, said to his mother:—’Born in the race of the\\n illustrious Vargava of unwearied actions, thou art going through mental\\n afflictions and unbearable insults; therefore, O mother, let us both\\n enter into fire. Let the king spend many nights with Sarmishthā—the\\n daughter of a demon. Thou mayst withstand the insults but I shall never\\n brooke them. Permit me, I shall, in sooth, renounce my life.’ The son\\n having, weepingly and distressingly, said this, Devajāni was greatly\\n enraged and thought of her father. As soon as he was thought of by his\\n daughter Vargava speedily came there and beholding her senseless and\\n deprived from joy said ’Daughter, what is the matter?’ The effulgent\\n father having addressed his daughter repeatedly in this wise, Devajāni,\\n enraged, replied:—’O foremost of ascetics, I shall either enter into\\n fire, water, or drink poison—by no means I shall preserve this life of\\n mine. Thou dost not know of the miseries and insults I have been subject\\n to. Brahman, when a tree is neglected, those who live thereon are also\\n distressed. The king having disregarded me, forsooth thou hast also been\\n neglected.’ Hearing the words of his daughter, Vargava, enraged said to\\n the king Yayāti ’Thou art vicious-minded, O son of Nahusha; thou hast\\n dishonored me and therefore in thy youth thou shalt be subject to\\n decrepitude and infirmities of age.’ Having thus imprecated the curse\\n and consoled his sorrowful daughter the highly illustrious rishi Vargava\\n repaired to his own habitation. Having thus conferred solace unto his\\n daughter, that leading Brahman, effulgent as the sun, returned\\n therefrom.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 68: '## SECTION LXIX.\\n \\n \\n \"Yayāti, the son of Nahusha, was greatly distressed on hearing of the\\n ire of the preceptor Sukra. Thereupon meeting with the infirmities of\\n age by the imprecation of the saint he said to his son Yadu:—’O Yadu,\\n thou art cognizant of religion, do thou therefore take this decrepitude\\n for me; I shall satisfy myself with various enjoyments. O foremost of\\n men, I have not been yet satiated with worldly enjoyments—I shall\\n therefore again take upon myself this decrepitude after having enjoyed\\n all objects of sense.’ Hearing those words of Yayāti, the foremost of\\n men, Yadu replied:—’Let thy most favourite son Puru take upon himself\\n this decrepitude. O king, thou hast deprived me from all things—what\\n more, thou dost not allow me to come near thee. Let that Puru take this,\\n with whom thou dost eat and live.’ Hearing the words of Yadu, Yayāti\\n said to Puru:—’O thou having large arms, do thou take the decrepitude\\n for me.’ Hearing the words of Yayāti, Puru, with folded hands, said:—’I\\n am always ready to satisfy thy commands; and I have been favoured and\\n honored by this command of thine.’ Hearing those words of Puru Yayāti\\n was highly pleased and attained to an excess of delight and then\\n transferred his own decrepitude to him. Thereupon regaining his youth\\n the king reigned in earth for many thousand years celebrating thousands\\n of sacrifices. Thereupon after a long time Yayāti said to Puru ’O my\\n son, do thou bring the decrepitude I have kept as deposit with thee—let\\n it now assail me. I transferred it to you as a deposit. For this I shall\\n take it back; be not sorry for this. I have been greatly pleased that\\n thou hast satisfied my behests. I shall, now pleased, install thee on\\n the royal throne.’ Having thus addressed his son Puru, the king Yayāti\\n angrily said to Yadu, the son of Devayani:—’Thou, vicious Rākshasa, art\\n born of me in the shape of a Kshatriya, or else why shouldst thou\\n disobey my orders? For this thou shalt never be a king. I am thy father\\n and preceptor and still thou hast disregarded me. Thou shalt be the\\n father of dreadful Rākshasas, O vicious minded; thy descendants shall be\\n degraded from the lunar race and thy children shall be equally\\n vicious-minded like thee.’ Having thus imprecated Yadu, the royal saint\\n Yayāti honored Puru, the enhancer of the prosperity of the kingdom, with\\n installation and then retired to woods. Thereupon after a long time he\\n breathed his last and went to the abode of the celestials. The highly\\n illustrious Puru reigned piously in the foremost of cities Prathishtan.\\n Yadu begot thousands and thousands of Rākhasas and being degraded from\\n the royal family reigned in a city named Kraunchavana, hard to be got\\n at. In this wise, according to the custom of the Kshatryas the king\\n Yayāti took upon himself the imprecation of the preceptor Sukra, but he\\n did not forgive him. I have thus related unto thee everything. O gentle\\n one, we shall follow the examples of these illustrious men. And in that\\n case we shall not be degraded like the king Nriga.\" While Rāma, having a\\n moon-like countenance, was speaking thus, the stars became fewer in the\\n welkin, and east, stricken with the early rays of the sun, appeared like\\n damsel, clothed in a raiment coloured with the dye of flowers.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",

The assembly of Rāma, of unwearied, actions appeared like that of\\n Mahendra, Yama and Varuna. Rāma said to Lakshmana, gifted with\\n auspicious marks \"O Saumitri having long arms, do thou proceed to the\\n city-gate to receive those who have come here for business.\" According\\n to Rāma’s command Lakshmana, gifted with auspicious mark, arrived at the\\n gate and called those who had come there for business. But none said\\n that he had been brought there by any business. For there was neither\\n disease nor poverty in the kingdom. During Rāma’s regime the earth was\\n filled with corns and _Asadhis_. Children young men and middle-aged\\n people did not meet with death. The earth was governed piously so there\\n was no obstacle. Thus during the administration of Rāma none was seen\\n who wanted justice. Lakshmana, with folded hands, said to Rāma, \"None\\n has come for business.\" Thereat, Rāma, with a delighted heart,\\n replied—\"Do thou go, O Saumitri, and see if any one has come for\\n business. Royal policy if properly adopted, impiety can stand nowhere.\\n It is for the fear of the king that people protect one another. And\\n although laws, instituted by me are protecting the subjects like so many\\n arrows, still, O thou having long arms, do thou be engaged in governing\\n the subjects.\" Being thus addressed Lakshmana issued out of the house\\n and saw that a dog was waiting at the gate. Casting its looks around it\\n was again and again barking. Beholding it in that plight the valiant\\n Lakshmana said \"O generous sir, what business has brought thee hither—do\\n thou relate it confidentially.\" Hearing the words of Lakshmana the dog\\n replied—\"I wish to relate it unto Rāma, of unwearied actions, who is the\\n refuge of all creatures and who declares fearlessness unto all.\" Hearing\\n the words of the dog Lakshmana entered the beautiful palace to relate it\\n unto Rāma. And having communicated it unto Rāma he issued out and said\\n to the dog:—\"If thou hast anything true to speak thou mayst come and\\n communicate it unto the king.\" Hearing the words of Lakshmana the dog\\n said—\"We cannot enter into the houses of divinities, kings and Brāhmanas\\n nor can we go there where is fire, Indra, the sun or the wind, for we\\n are the vilest born; so I cannot enter there. For king is the\\n personification of virtue and specially the king Rāma is truthful, well\\n versed in the science of fighting and ever engaged in the welfare of all\\n beings. He is perfectly cognizant of where the six qualities are to be\\n applied—master of morality, knoweth all, seeth all and the best of\\n beautiful. He is the moon, death, Yama, Kuvera, the giver of riches,\\n fire, Indra, the sun and Varuna. O Saumitri, do thou go and communicate\\n unto the king protecting his subjects that without his permission I do\\n not wish to go there.\" Thereupon the highly effulgent and noble-minded\\n Lakshmana entered the palace and said to Rāma:—\"O thou having long arms,\\n O thou the enhancer of Kausalyā’s joy—I have communicated thine orders—I\\n shall relate shortly everything regarding that; do thou hear.

The king is awake when the subjects\\n are asleep and he protects them. By administering the laws properly the\\n king protects piety. Without his shelter the subjects meet with\\n destruction. The king is the lord and father of the whole universe. He\\n is time, he is Yuga and he is the creation, mobile and immobile. He is\\n called _Dharma_ because he holdeth all. It is _Dharma_ (virtue) that\\n upholdeth all mankind. It is by Dharma that the three worlds are being\\n preserved. It is _Dharma_ or virtue that thwarts the enemies. It is\\n virtue that governs the subjects duly. It is for this that virtue is\\n called _Dhārana_ or the holder. The virtue of preservation is the\\n greatest and confers fruits in after life. There is nothing like virtue\\n hard to acquire in this world. Charity, kindness, honoring the pious and\\n innocent conduct constitute the chief virtues; for by those the\\n well-being of this life and the next is brought about. O Rāghava, O thou\\n of firms vows—thou art an example of examples. Thou art cognizant of the\\n conduct of the pious. Thou art like an ocean, the refuge of all virtues.\\n O foremost of kings, out of ignorance, I have spoken unto thee so many\\n things. With my head downwards, I beg for thy satisfaction. Be not\\n offended with me.\" Hearing those wise words of the dog, Rāma said—\"What\\n shall I do for thee? Do thou mention it confidentially.\" Whereto the dog\\n replied, saying:—\"It is by piety that a king governs his kingdom—it is\\n by virtue that a king protects his subjects, becomes a refuge unto all\\n and removes the fear of his men. Keeping an eye on this, O Rāma do thou\\n hear, what I say. In the house of a certain Brahman there lives a beggar\\n by the name of _Sarvarthasiddha_ (_i.e._, who has got all his desires\\n satisfied). And although I am innocent, he has for nothing hurt me.\"\\n Hearing those words Rāma sent his messenger who brought\\n _Sarvarthasiddha_, master of all subjects. Thereupon beholding Rāma in\\n the assembly that effulgent and leading twice-born one said:—\"O\\n blameless Rāma, tell me what I shall do for thee.\" Whereto Rāma said—\"O\\n twice-born one, thou hast hurt this dog. What offence did it commit by\\n thee that thou didst strike it severely with a rod. Anger is an enemy\\n which taketh away life. Anger is a sweet-speeched enemy in the garb of a\\n friend. It is the foremost of passions and like unto a sharp dagger. And\\n it is anger that stealeth away every thing. It pilfers all that is\\n acquired by asceticism, sacrifices and gifts. It is proper therefore by\\n every means to kill anger. Passions are running amock on all sides like\\n so many exceedingly wicked steeds. Being satiated with of all objects of\\n enjoyments it is better to govern them by patience. By mind, actions,\\n words and eyes a man should engage in the well being of people. He\\n should not injure any body and be not addicted to any thing. The harm,\\n that a mind not under control, can accomplish, is beyond the range of a\\n sharp dagger, trodden serpent and of an enemy always enraged. Even the\\n nature of one, who has learnt humility, cannot be trusted. He, who hides\\n his nature, himself reveals his true self.\" Rāma, of unwearied actions,\\n having said this, _Sarvarthasiddha_, the foremost of twice-born ones,\\n said:—\"Knocking about the whole day for alms I was highly enraged and\\n struck this dog. It was sitting in the mid-way and I asked it again and\\n again to move away. Thereupon, moving away and standing with reluctance,\\n it stood fearfully on the road-side. O descendant of Raghu, I was at\\n that time stricken with hunger, and struck it for its vicious conduct. O\\n king of kings, I am guilty in this, and thou must punish me. O lord of\\n kings, do thou administer punishment unto me,—I shall then be released\\n from the fear of hell.\" Thereupon, Rāma asked all the ministers,\\n saying:—\"What is to be done now? What punishment is to be inflicted on\\n him? We can protect subjects, if we can administer punishment\\n proportionate to crime.\" Thereat, Vrigu, Angiras, Kutsa, Vasishtha,\\n Kashya and other ascetics, the leading preachers, the ministers, the\\n citizens, and other sages conversant with Sastras, present there,\\n said:—\"A Brāhmana should not be punished with death.\" The sages\\n conversant with laws having said this, the ascetics addressed Rāma,\\n saying:—\"O Rāghava, a king is the governor of all—specially thyself.\\n Thou art the chastiser of the three worlds, the eternal Vishnu.\" They\\n all having said this, the dog began:—\"Thou didst solemnly say ’What\\n shall I do for thee?’ Therefore, if thou art gratified with me, and if\\n thou dost wish to confer boons on me, do thou appoint this Brāhmana as\\n the head of family.\" Thereupon, having been thus honored and pleased and\\n ascending an elephant, he proceeded to occupy his new dignified station.\\n At this, the councillors of Rāma, surprised, said:—\"O thou of great\\n effulgence, he has not been punished. Rather thou hast conferred on him\\n a boon.\" Hearing the words of ministers, Rāma said:—\"You do not know the\\n real truth of the whole thing—the dog knows it well.\" Being accosted by\\n Rāma, the dog said:—\"O Rāghava, I was the head of the family of\\n Kālanjava. After the worship of the deities and Brāhmana and the\\n feasting of the servants, male, and female, I used to take my food. I\\n used to parcel out things duly, and my mind was not in the least\\n attached to sin. I used to preserve with great care the articles\\n belonging to the tutelary deities, was humble, good-natured and engaged\\n in the well-being of all animals. Still I have fallen into this dreadful\\n and wretched condition. O Rāghava, this Brāhmana is angry by nature, and\\n impious, injures others, and is impatient, cruel, harsh in words and\\n ignorant, and therefore shall degrade his seven generations up and down.\\n He will by no means be able to discharge the duties of a head of a\\n family. He, whom thou wishest to take to hell with her son, beasts and\\n friends, should be engaged in the serving the Brāhmans and kine. For all\\n his good actions, he is slain who steals the wealth of a Brāhmana, a\\n deity, a woman, and a boy, and the riches given away by him. O Rāghava,\\n one who pilfers the riches of a Brāhmana or a deity falls into a hell\\n called Vichi. Even he who thinks in his mind of stealing it, goes once\\n and again into hell.\" Hearing the words of the dog, the eyes of the\\n effulgent Rāma were expanded with surprise. The dog went back from where\\n it had come. In its pristine birth the dog was high-minded—it is now\\n cursed for being born in a degraded state of existence. Thereupon,\\n repairing at last to Vārānasi the dog took the vow of fasting.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 71: '## SECTION LXXII.\\n \\n \\n There lived for a long time a vulture and an owl on a mountain extending\\n over the banks of a river, resonant with the notes of cuckoos and filled\\n with lions, tigers and various birds, situated in a pleasant forest\\n abounding in trees near the city of Ayodhyā. Once on a time the vicious\\n vulture alleging that the nest of the owl was his own, began to quarrel\\n with him. O worshipful Sir, thereupon they both said:—\"The lotus-eyed\\n Rāma is the king of all people; let us go to him and he will decide to\\n whom the nest belongs.\" Having thus settled the vulture and the owl,\\n being impatient with rage, quarrelling with one another, appeared before\\n Rāma and touched his feet. Beholding that lord of men, the vulture said:\\n \"O preserver of humanity, thou art the foremost of celestials and\\n Asuras. O thou of great effulgence, thou art gifted with intelligence\\n and learning more than Vrihaspati and Sukrachārya. Thou art cognisant of\\n the good and bad conditions of creatures. In beauty thou art like the\\n Moon and art irrepressible like the Sun. In glory thou art like\\n Himalaya, in gravity like the Ocean, in prowess like the Patriarch, in\\n patience like the Earth, and in velocity like the Wind. O Rāghava, thou\\n art the preceptor of the mobile and immobile creation, gifted with all\\n sorts of wealth, illustrious, devoid of a revengeful spirit,\\n unconquerable, victorious, and master of all Sastras and laws. O\\n foremost of men, hear. I have an application to thee. O Rāghava, I had\\n built a nest for myself; this owl is now occupying it as his own;\\n therefore, O king, do thou save me.\" The vulture having said this, the\\n owl began:—\"True, it is, O king, that in him are the portions of the\\n Moon, Indra, the Sun, Kuvera and Yama, but there is in him also a\\n portion of man. But thou art thyself the omnipresent deity, Nārāyana.\\n Thou, impelled by thine own self, dost judge all creatures impartially;\\n therefore, a portion of gentleness is well manifest in thee and\\n therefore do people call thee, a portion of the Moon. O patriarch, in\\n anger, punishment, gift and fear, thou art our giver, destroyer and\\n protector,—it is for this that thou art called Indra. In energy thou art\\n like fire irrepressible unto all creatures, and because thou dost spread\\n thy lusture upon all creatures, that thou art called the Sun. Thou art\\n the very lord of riches or art even superior to Kuvera; like Padmā unto\\n the lord of riches, Sri is always by thee. Because thou dost discharge\\n the functions of Kuvera, thou art the giver of wealth unto us. O\\n Rāghava, thou lookest upon all creatures, mobile and immobile, with an\\n impartial eye—thou dost regard thy friends and foes with impartiality,\\n and thou art duly protecting thy subjects. O Rāghava, death pursues him\\n with whom thou art offended—and it is for this reason that thou art\\n styled by people ’the highly powerful Yama.’ O foremost of kings,\\n because thou art forgiving unto all creatures and a kind king that\\n people sing thy glories as of a man on earth. The king is the strength\\n of the weak and helpless and he is the eye of the blind and the refuge\\n of those who have no shelter. Thou art also our king; therefore do thou\\n listen to our petition. O king, entering into my nest, this vulture is\\n oppressing me. Thou only, O foremost of men, art the divine chastiser of\\n mankind.\" Hearing those words, Rāma sent for his councillors. The\\n ministers of Daçaratha and Rāma, Vrishthi, Yayanta, Vijaya, Siddhārtha,\\n Rāshtravarddhana, Asoka, Darmapāla the highly powerful Sumantra and\\n others were well versed in laws, high-minded, conversant with all the\\n Sastras, intelligent, born in respectable families, and adepts in\\n counsel. Having invited them all and ascending his Pushpaka car, he went\\n to the place in question, and, descending there, asked the vulture, \"How\\n long has this nest been made? Tell me, if thou remember it.\" Whereto the\\n vulture replied:—\"From the time mankind were first born and spread over\\n the four quarters of the globe have I been living in this nest.\" The owl\\n said:—\"At the time when the earth was (first) adorned with trees that\\n this nest of mine was constructed.\" Hearing these words, Rāma said to\\n the councillors:—\"That assembly is not an assembly where there are no\\n friends—nor are they old men who do not dwell upon religious topics.\\n That religion is not a religion where there is no truth and that truth\\n is not the truth where there is hypocrisy. Those councillors are liars\\n who do not give proper replies in time on the subjects they are\\n well-informed on. He who does give reply to a question under the\\n influence of passion, anger or fear, binds himself with a thousand\\n nooses of Varuna, and at the expiration of full one year he is released\\n from a single sin.\" Hearing these words, the ministers said to Rāma:—\"O\\n thou having a large mind, what the owl has said is true—the vulture has\\n not spoken the truth. Thou art the evidence this, O great king—for the\\n king is the last refuge of all—the root of the subject and the eternal\\n religion. He who is punished by the king, is not doomed to a degraded\\n state. He is, in truth, saved from the fear of hell and reaches a better\\n state.\" Hearing the words of the ministers, Rāma said:—\"Hear what is\\n mentioned in the Puranas. Formerly the Sun, the Moon, the welkin with\\n the stars, the earth with the mountains and forests—the three worlds,\\n the mobile and the immobile, were under water. At that time only\\n Nārāyana existed as the second Sumeru. In Nārāyana’s belly was stationed\\n the earth with Lakshmi. Having destroyed the creation and entered water,\\n the highly effulgent Vishnu, identical with the souls of creatures, lay\\n asleep there for many long years. Beholding Vishnu asleep after the\\n destruction of the universe and knowing Vishnu of obstructed breath, the\\n great ascetic Brahmā entered his abdomen. Thereupon, when a golden lotus\\n sprang from Vishnu’s navel. That great lord, ascetic Brahmā, originated\\n therefrom and was engaged in austere penances for the purpose of\\n creating earth, air, mountains, trees, men, reptiles and all animals\\n born from womb or egg. At that time from the ears of Nārāyana originated\\n two valiant and dreadful demons under the name of Madhu and Kaitabha.\\n Beholding the Patriarch, there they were greatly enraged, and pursued\\n him. Thereat, the self-born cried aloud hideously. Awakened by that\\n sound, Nārāyana engaged in fighting with Madhu and Kaitabha, and slew\\n them with his discus. And with their gore the whole earth was deluged.\\n Thereupon, purifying the earth again, Hari, preserver of the world,\\n covered it with trees. And various drugs were also created. And the\\n earth was called _Medini_ because it was filled with _Medas_ marrow of\\n Madhu and Kaitabha. It is for this that I hold, O ministers, that this\\n house does not belong to the vulture, but to the owl. Therefore, this\\n vicious vulture should be punished—for this wicked, vicious-minded one,\\n robbing another’s nest, is oppressing him.\" In the interval a voice was\\n heard in the sky stating the true facts:—\"O Rāma, do not slay the\\n vulture,—for it has already been reduced to ashes by the force of\\n Gautama’s asceticism. O lord of men, this vulture, in its pristine\\n birth, was a heroic truthful and pure king by the name of Brahmadatta.\\n Once on a time a Brāhamana, by the name of Gautama, the very\\n personification of Kāla, came to the house of Brahmadatta for food and\\n said:—’O king, I shall feed in thy house for more than a hundred years.’\\n Thereupon, offering that effulgent Brāhmana, with his own hands, water\\n to wash his feet the king Brahmadatta, made arrangements for his meal.\\n Accidentally flesh was mixed with the food of the high-souled Gautama.\\n Being enraged thereat, the ascetic imprecated him with a dreadful curse\\n and said:—’O king, thou become a vulture.’ The king said:—’Be\\n propitiated, O thou of great vows; do not imprecate me thus. I have, out\\n of ignorance committed this offence. O great one, O blameless one, do\\n thou act so that this curse may find termination.’ Thereat understanding\\n that this offence was committed by the king unwittingly, the ascetic\\n said—’O king, in the race of Ikshwākus a king shall be born under the\\n name of Rāma. O foremost of men, thou shalt be released from the curse\\n when he shall touch thee.’\" Hearing the voice in the sky, Rāma touched\\n Brahmadatta. Thereupon renouncing his vulture from and assuming a\\n beautiful body smeared with celestial perfumes, he praised Rāma and\\n said:—\"O thou conversant with piety, by thy Favour have I been saved\\n from the dreadful hell—here hath ended my curse.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 72: '## SECTION LXXIII.\\n \\n \\n As Rāma and Lakshmana were (daily) engaged in conversing thus, the\\n vernal night, neither hot nor cold, came on. And it came to pass that\\n one bright morning, after having performed his first diurnal rites,\\n Kākutstha, understanding the ways of the citizens, became anxious to\\n present himself at a spot whence he could observe the citizens. At this\\n time Sumantra, entering, addressed him, saying,—\"O king, stopped at the\\n gate, some ascetics stay there,—_Maharshis_, led by Bhārgava and\\n Chyavana. And, O mighty monarch, eager for a sight of thee, those\\n dwellers on the banks of the Yamunā, well pleased, have despatched me\\n (hither), O tiger among men.\" Hearing his words, the righteous Rāma\\n answered: \"Let the exalted Dwijas enter.\" Thereat, honoring the royal\\n mandate, the warder with joined hands brought those ascetics difficult\\n of being approached. And numbering over an hundred, flaming up in their\\n native effulgence, those high-souled anchorets entered the royal\\n residence. And they presented Rāma with various fruits in profusion and\\n vessels filled with sanctified waters of all holy spots. Thereupon,\\n accepting the waters of the holy places as well as the various kinds of\\n fruit, that mighty-armed one spake to the mighty ascetics: \"Do ye\\n agreeably to desert take these seats.\" Hearing Rāma’s speech, all the\\n Maharshis sat down on those graceful and elegant golden seats. And\\n seeing the saints seated there, that captor of hostile capitals,\\n Rāghava, restraining himself, with joined hands, observed: \"What is the\\n reason of your visit? What shall I needfully perform for you? I am\\n worthy of being commanded by the Maharshis; and I must without demur\\n compass every pleasure of theirs. And this entire monarchy, and the life\\n that is resident in my heart,—all these are for the regenerate ones.\\n This I tell you in the name of truth.\" Hearing his words, the sages of\\n fierce austerities inhabiting the banks of the Yamunā, broke out into a\\n peal of plaudits. And those high-souled ones, exceedingly rejoiced,\\n said: \"On earth, O crown of men, this can only be expected from thee and\\n nobody else. Many kings wielding great power have passed away who,\\n having regard to the (possible) gravity of the undertaking, could not\\n bring themselves to promise anything beforehand. But, without knowing he\\n task, thou hast bound thyself by a promise for the glory of the\\n Brāhmanas.

       " 73: '## SECTION LXXXV.\\n \\n \\n When the sages had spoken thus, Kakutstha said: \"O ascetics, tell me\\n what is the work which I shall have to accomplish in your behalf. Your\\n fear shall be removed.\" As Kākutstha was speaking thus, Bhargava\\n remarked: \"O lord of men, do thou hear of the origin of the fear that\\n threatens our country. O king, formerly in the Krita age, there was a\\n magnanimous offspring of Diti, the mighty Asura, Madu, eldest son of\\n Lotā. He was well disposed towards Brāhmanas, kind to those seeking his\\n refuge, and gifted with high intelligence. The exceedingly generous\\n deities delighted in him greatly. And by way of honoring him, Rudra\\n conferred a wonderful boon upon Madhu endowed with prowess and ever\\n intent on religion. And extracting a dart from his own, possessed of\\n terrific energy, endowed with great force, and furnished with exceeding\\n splendour, that high-souled one, well pleased, made it over (to Madhu)\\n and spoke to him. Thou hast practised excellent and unrivalled\\n righteousness, which hath won my good graces, and (therefore), I, highly\\n gratified, bestow on thee this choice weapon. So long as thou, O mighty\\n Asura, dost not assail celestials and Vipras, so long shall this be\\n thine,—otherwise it shall come to naught. Reducing to cinders the person\\n that shall rashly enter upon conflict with thee, this dart shall return\\n to thy hand.\" Having thus obtained the boon from Rudra, the mighty\\n Asura, again bowing to Mahādeva, addressed him, saying: \"O reverend one,\\n may this excellent dart be the possession of my family. O god, thou art\\n the lord of the immortals.’ Thereat the lord of all beings, the mighty\\n deity Siva, answered Madhu, when he had spoken thus: ’This will not be.\\n But in order that thy prayer may not go for nothing, I graciously say in\\n thy behalf that one of thy sons shall sway this dart. So long that\\n dart-handed one shall be incapable of being destroyed by any creature.’\\n Having obtained this wonderful boon from the god, Madhu—foremost of\\n Asuras—caused a splendid city to be constructed. His beloved wife the\\n exalted and majestic Kumbhinasi is the offspring of Viçwavasu by Analā.\\n Her son, the highly powerful wicked, and fierce Lavana, ever since his\\n boyhood, gave himself up to a sinful course of life. Seeing his son,\\n committed to an impious course Madhu was overcome with grief, but he did\\n not say anything to him. And forsaking this world, he entered the region\\n of Varuna; and making over the dart unto Lavana, communicated to him all\\n about the boon he had obtained. And by virtue of the power of the dart,\\n he oppresseth the three worlds in especial the ascetics; such is the\\n power of Lavana, and such is his dart. Hearing all this O Kākutstha,\\n thou art capable (of righting our wrong.) Thou art our chief resource. O\\n Rāma many a monarch hath been already sued by the sages, O hero, to\\n deliver them from this fear,—but we have not yet found a deliverer.\\n Hearing, O child, that Rāvana together with all his forces and vehicles\\n hath been destroyed (by thee), we know that there breathes not another\\n king on earth capable of delivering us. Therefore our prayer is that\\n thou mayst deliver us afflicted with the fear of Lavana. Thus, O Rāma,\\n have we acquainted thee with the occasion of fear that hath arisen. Thou\\n art capable of coping with the same. Do thou of undeteriorated prowess,\\n do the needful.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 74: '## SECTION LXXVI.\\n \\n \\n Thus accosted (by the sages), Rāma answered them with joined hands:\\n \"What doth he live on? What are his ways? And where doth Lavana live?\"\\n Hearing Rāghava’s words, the sages informed him of the way in which\\n Lavana increased in power. \"His food is every creature specially\\n ascetics; his manner of life is regulated by ferocity and his constant\\n home is Madhuvana. Slaying constantly thousands on thousands of lions\\n and tigers and deer, and birds and human beings, he provides his daily\\n food (with their flesh.) And like the Destroyer on the occasion of the\\n universal dissolution, that one possessed of gigantic strength feeds on\\n other creatures as well.\" Hearing this, Rāghava spoke to the mighty\\n ascetics: \"I will slay that Raksha. Let your fright depart.\" Having thus\\n bound himself with that promise to the ascetics of fierce energy,\\n Raghu’s son along with his brothers spoke: \"What hero shall slay Lavana?\\n Do you decide this. On whom shall devolve this duty? Whether the mighty\\n armed Bharata or the intelligent Satrughna shall (do this work?)\" Thus\\n addressed by Rāghava Bharata remarked: \"I will slay this. Let this task\\n be entrusted to me.\" Hearing Bharata’s speech instinct with fortitude\\n and valor, the younger brother of Lakshmana stood up, leaving his golden\\n seat. And Satrughna, saluting the king represented: \"The mighty-armed\\n second son of Raghu hath already achieved a grand work: he formerly\\n governed Ayodhyā empty of the noble one,⁹⁶ bearing in his heart the\\n grief connected with his return. Undergoing many a hardship, king, that\\n illustrious one passed his days, lying down on a bed of sorrow, and\\n living on fruits and roots, and wearing rags. Having suffered such\\n misery, Raghu’s son should not be suffered to undergo trouble, while, O\\n king I his servant is by.\" On Satrughna saying this, Rāghava again said:\\n \"Let this be so. Do thou do my bidding. I shall install thee on the\\n graceful city of Madhu; or if thou wish without and entrust Bharata with\\n this task, O long-armed one. Heroic, and accomplished, thou art\\n competent to found a city on the Yamunā as well as flourishing\\n provinces. He that, having people’s dominion, doth not furnish it with a\\n king, goeth to hell. So if thou accept my words, then slaying Madhu’s\\n son, the sinful Lavana, rule the kingdom righteously. O hero, thou must\\n say anything after what I have spoken. Without doubt, a youthful younger\\n brother must obey the injunctions of his elder brother. Do thou, O\\n Kākutstha, accept the installation which I confer on thee, preluded by\\n the prescribed religious formulae uttered by Vipras headed by\\n Vasishtha.\"\\n \\n    ⁹⁶ Rāma.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 75: '## SECTION LXXVII.\\n \\n \\n Thus accosted by Rāma, the exceedingly energetic Satrughna was\\n powerfully wrought up with bashfulness, and replied slowly: \"O lord of\\n men, this doth not appear to be in consonance with morality. Wherefore,\\n an elder brother existing, wouldst thou install a younger one? I must, O\\n best of men, do thy behest; for, O exalted one, thy mandate can never be\\n passed by me. O hero, I have heard from thee as well as from the Sruti\\n (touching the morality concerned).⁹⁷ When my second brother had already\\n vowed (that he would slay Lavana), I ought not to have returned the\\n answer I actually have. I saying,—‘I will in battle slay the dreadful\\n Lavana,’ I have been guilty of an unrighteous speech. And it is for this\\n transgression that, O powerful one, I shall have to undergo this\\n improper process. But, albeit this course is unrighteous and entails\\n perdition, yet desired by my eldest brother, I certainly ought not to\\n make any answer. And, O Kākutstha, a second answer I would not return;\\n so that, O bestower of honor, I may not, by a second reply, render\\n myself liable to a fresh punishment. In this matter, O chief of men, I\\n will even do thy desire. Do thou, O descendant of Raghu, so order that\\n sin may not be mine (in having obeyed thy mandate.)\" Thus addressed by\\n the heroic and high-souled Satrughna, Rāma, delighted, spoke unto\\n Bharata and Lakshmana,—\"Do you carefully provide the things necessary\\n for the coronation: this very day shall I install that foremost of men,\\n the descendant of Raghu. And by my order do you summon the Purodhasas, O\\n Kākutstha, and the citizens and the Ritwijas, and the councillors.\"\\n Having received the royal behest, the mighty car-warriors did\\n accordingly. And the Kshatriyas and the Brāhmanas entered the royal\\n mansion with the priest as well as the requisite things for the\\n installation. And then commenced the auspicious sprinkling of the\\n high-souled Satrughna, gladdening (the hearts of all in) the palace of\\n Rāghava. And on being installed Kākutstha resembled the Sun; and he like\\n Skanda formerly installed by the celestials led by Indra. And when\\n Satrughna had been installed by Rāma of untiring deeds, the citizens as\\n well as the Brāhmanas of vast Vedic attainments experienced excess of\\n joy. And Kausalyā and Sumitra and Kaikeyi and the other wives of the\\n king set up festal salutation in the palace. And on Satrughna having\\n been installed the high-souled sages dwelling on the banks of the\\n Jamunā, thought that Lavana had been slain. Then placing the installed\\n Satrughna on his lap, Rāghava, extolling his prowess, addressed him\\n sweet words: \"O captor of hostile capitals, this divine arrow never\\n missing is thine. With this, O son of Raghu, thou, O placid one, wilt\\n slay Lavana. O Kākutstha, this shaft was forged when invisible by\\n celestials and Asuras the divine self-sprung and invincible (deity)\\n reposed on the mighty main, and when creation was oppressed by Madhu and\\n Kaitabha as well as other Rākshasas. He, overwhelmed with rage desirous\\n of creating the three worlds, created this best of arrows invincible to\\n all beings, for the destruction of the wicked ones; and destroyed them\\n in battle by means of this very arrow. And having with this foremost of\\n shafts finished Madhu and Kaitabha, they set about creating the worlds.\\n When, O Satrughna, formerly I sought to slay Rāvana, I did not discharge\\n this arrow, thinking that if discharged, it would inflict great havoc on\\n creatures. Keeping in his abode that great and redoubted which had been\\n bestowed on Madhu by the high-souled Tryamvaka, for the destruction of\\n foes,—and worshipping the same ever, Lavana goeth about and secureth\\n excellent fare (for himself) when one challenged him, desirous of\\n reducing him (his antagonist) to ashes. Therefore, O foremost of men,\\n thou shouldst, before entering the city, stand at the gate obstructing\\n his course. O thou having long arms, thou shouldst invite him for battle\\n when he shall be weaponless and in that way wouldst be able to destroy\\n him. And by no other means he is to be slain. If thou canst encompass\\n this, he shall forsooth be slain. O my son, I have thus told thee the\\n way in which the dart should be thwarted. It is impossible to surpass\\n the prowess of the graceful Nilkantha.\"\\n \\n    ⁹⁷ _i.e._ of being installed as a king during the life of my elder\\n       brother.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",

O foremost of men, O Satrughna, do thou\\n proceed with _Nijuta_ gold and silver coins and necessary riches and\\n conveyances. Do thou so act, O hero, that soldiers might be well-fed and\\n delighted and be not annoyed with thee. Do thou please them with sweet\\n words, for the servants, when they face enemies, have not with them\\n friends or wives—and so they are pleased, O Rāghava when they receive\\n sufficient food and presents, O Satrughna, having sent before a huge and\\n well contented army do thou proceed afterwards to _Madhuvana_. Thou\\n shouldst proceed so fearlessly that Madhu’s son Lavana might not know\\n that thou wert going for encounter. O foremost of men, he shall not be\\n slain by any other expedient than that I have acquainted thyself with.\\n If he can perceive before, whoever that enemy might be, Lavana shall\\n forsooth destroy him. When rains shall set in after the expiration of\\n the present summer thou shouldst slay him for that is the proper time\\n for destroying that vicious-minded one. For he shall then fearlessly\\n move about leaving off his dart understanding that no one would come to\\n fight with him during rains. Let the soldiers only now proceed with\\n ascetics before them; the summer hath not as yet fully expired and this\\n is the time, when they shall, without any trouble, be able to cross the\\n Ganges. Afterwards having encamped thy army on the other side of the\\n Ganges thou shouldst alone proceed speedily with thy bow.\" Hearing those\\n words of Rāma and summoning his highly powerful and leading warriors\\n Satrughna said \"Do ye all proceed and halt at those places which are\\n well known to you.

There was a king by the name of Saudāsa—one of\\n thy ancestors. His son Virjashaha was a highly powerful and pious king.\\n The heroic Saudāsa was fond of hunting from his boyhood. Once on a time\\n while a-hunting, he espied two Rakshasas in the forest. He had heard\\n about them many times before; they were in the shape of tigers and of a\\n dreadful figure and were not satiated with devouring many thousand deer.\\n King Saudāsa saw those two Rākshasas and found the forest divested of\\n all creatures. And enraged in consequence thereof he slew one of them.\\n Having slain him and been at ease, Saudāsa, the foremost of men, began\\n to eye that Rākshasa. His mate, greatly aggrieved, said to him:—’O\\n vicious one, thou hast, without any fault, slain my companion—I shall\\n therefore mete out becoming punishment unto thee.’ Having said this the\\n Rākshasa vanished therefrom. Thereupon in time the prince Virjashaha\\n became king. Saudāsa engaged in celebrating a mighty horse-sacrifice in\\n the vicinity of this hermitage. Vasishtha officiated as a priest at that\\n sacrifice. It continued for many Ayuta years. For immense riches the\\n sacrifice appeared like one performed by the celestials. Thereupon when\\n the sacrifice was about to be finished the aforesaid Rākshasa,\\n remembering his former enmity, assumed the shape of Vasishtha and said\\n to the king Saudāsa:—’O king, to-day the sacrifice shall end; do\\n therefore, without any delay, feed me with meat.’ Hearing the words of\\n the Rākshasa in the guise of a Brahman, the king ordered his expert\\n cooks, saying:—’Do ye soon prepare such dishes of meat as may satisfy my\\n preceptor Vasishtha.’ Having been ordered by the king the cooks\\n reverentially went away and the Rākshasa assuming their shape brought\\n before the king dishes. The king and queen offered those dishes unto the\\n ascetic Vasishtha, who, after being treated to them, perceived that they\\n were of human flesh and, terribly enraged, said:—’O king, let this be\\n thy food which thou hast offered me; this shall not prove otherwise.’\\n Being enraged on hearing it the king Saudāsa took water in his palms and\\n was about to imprecate Vasishtha, when his queen, preventing him\\n said:—’O king, the illustrious great ascetic Vasishtha is our preceptor\\n and priest and so thou shouldst not imprecate him.’ Hearing those words\\n of his queen, the king Saudāsa, threw off that powerful water on his own\\n feet which at once became dark. From that time the illustrious king\\n Saudāsa became also known by the name of Kalasmpāda. Thereupon the king\\n with his spouse again and again bowed unto Vasishtha’s feet and informed\\n him of what the Rākshasa had done under the guise of a Brāhmana. Hearing\\n the words of the king and being apprised that this vile act had been\\n done by the Rākshasa, Vasishtha said, ’O king, even what I have said\\n angrily shall not prove futile. However I confer upon thee this boon\\n that after twelve years thou shalt be freed from this curse, and by my\\n favour thou shalt cherish no recollection of thy condition extending\\n over those twelve years.’ Having thus suffered the consequences of the\\n curse, Saudāsa, the slayer of enemies, again obtained his kingdom and\\n governed his subjects. O descendant of Rāghu, the sacrificial ground of\\n which thou hast asked me, belongs to the king Saudasa.\" Having thus\\n heard the dreadful story of the king Saudāsa and saluted the ascetic\\n Vālmiki, Satrughna entered a thatched cottage.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",

In the midnight the Muni boys came to Vālmiki\\n and communicated unto him this auspicious intelligence, saying \"O\\n illustrious Sir, the beloved spouse of Rāma hath given birth to two\\n sons; do thou so protect them that evil spirits might not injure them.\"\\n Hearing those words the highly effulgent Vālmiki went there and attained\\n to great delight on beholding those two highly effulgent sons,\\n resembling the newly risen sun and the celestials. Thereupon he made\\n arrangements against the oppression of ghosts and goblins. Thereupon\\n taking Kusa (the upper part of the grass) and Lava (the lower part) the\\n great ascetic Vālmiki made those arrangements. And giving Kusa\\n sanctified by Mantras unto the hands of elderly women he said, \"Do ye\\n rub the person of the elder boy with these,\" and giving them Lava he\\n said \"Do ye rub the person of the younger brother with this. And\\n according to this I shall name the first Son Kusa and the second Lava;\\n and by those names they shall be celebrated on earth.\" Thereupon\\n reverentially taking from the hands of Vālmiki and Kusa Lava, the means\\n of protection, the elderly ladies engaged in guarding them. Hearing that\\n Sitā without any trouble had given birth to two sons and elderly female\\n ascetics had been engaged in protecting them and hearing the chanting of\\n Rāma’s glories in the midnight, Satrughna thought within himself.\\n \"Blessed it is that Sitā hath given birth to two sons.\" And with this\\n joy the live long night of Srābana passed away in no time. Having\\n performed the morning rites after the expiration of the night and taken\\n farewell from the ascetic Vālmiki, Lakshmana proceeded towards the west.\\n And having spent seven nights he at last arrived at the hermitage of the\\n pious Rishis living on the banks of the Yamunā. Taking shelter there he\\n engaged in pleasant conversation with Chābanya and other ascetics.\\n Having remained there for the night and talked with those ascetics the\\n high-souled, heroic Raghu prince Satrughna was greatly delighted.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 79: '## SECTION LXXX.\\n \\n \\n Thereupon when the night set in Satrughna accosted Vrigu’s son Chābanya\\n saying, \"O Brahman, how powerful is Lavana? And what is the strength of\\n his dart? What persons before had been destroyed by this dart in\\n conflict?\" Hearing the words of the high-souled descendant of\\n Raghu,—Satrughna, the highly effulgent Chābanya replied saying.—\"O\\n descendant of Raghu, Lavana hath accomplished many works by this dart;\\n amongst them, hear what Māndhāta, born in the race of Ikshwāku, did. The\\n early king of Ayodhyā was known over the three worlds under the name of\\n Māndhāta. He was the son of Yavanāshwa, highly powerful and strong.\\n Having brought the whole world under his subjection the king Māndhāta\\n engaged in the conquest of the celestial region. He having been engaged\\n in making preparations to conquer the world of gods—the celestial chief\\n Indra with other immortals was greatly terrified. With this promise, the\\n king Māndhāta went up into the celestial region that he would occupy the\\n half of Indra’s throne and kingdom and the celestials would adore him.\\n Being apprised of this vicious intention of his, Indra, the slayer of\\n Paka, consoled him in sweet words, saying;—’O foremost of men, even in\\n the land of men, thou hast not been able to become the real king.\\n Without perfectly subjugating the earth how dost thou wish to lord over\\n the celestial kingdom? If the whole world is under thy subjection, O\\n hero, be thou, with the whole host of thy servants and soldiers,\\n installed on the celestial throne.’ Indra having said this, the\\n high-souled Māndhāta replied:—’O Sakra, who on this earth, hath\\n disobeyed my commands?’ Whereto Indra replied ’O sinless one, the\\n night-ranger, Lavana, Madhu’s son, living in Madhuvana, is not under thy\\n control.’ Hearing those dreadful and unpleasant words from Indra, the\\n king lowered his head in shame and became silent. Thereupon, having\\n welcomed Indra in that way, he left there and returned to earth. O\\n slayer of enemies, with an angry heart, army and conveyance he went to\\n subjugate Madhu’s son Lavana and sent an emissary inviting him to\\n battle. The ambassador, having gone there, addressed many unpleasant\\n words unto Lavana and the night-ranger devoured him. On the other hand\\n finding the delay of his return the king Māndhāta, enraged, began to\\n assail the Rākshasa Lavana with arrows from all sides. Laughing wildly\\n Lavana took up the dart in his hand and discharged it to destroy the\\n king with his followers. Thereupon growing powerful the dart reduced the\\n king with his servants and army into ashes and returned to Lavana. In\\n this wise the high-souled king Māndhāta, with his huge army, was slain.\\n O gentle hero, incomparable and great is the strength of the dart.\\n Forsooth thou shalt slay Lavana next morning. Certain is thy victory if\\n Lavana cannot take up his dart. People shall be at ease if thou canst\\n bring about the destruction of Lavana. O foremost of men, I shall then\\n describe unto thee the incomparable and dreadful prowess of the\\n vicious-souled Lavana and his dart. O king, with great exertions did\\n Lavana slay Māndhāta and not easily. O high-minded one, next morning\\n thou shalt surely destroy Lavana. He shall issue out for flesh without\\n taking his dart. And at that time, O lord of men, thou shalt, for sooth,\\n be crowned will victory.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 80: '## SECTION LXXXI.\\n \\n \\n They being thus engaged in conversation regarding his achieving victory\\n without any danger Satrughna in no time passed the night. The clear\\n morning having arrived, the heroic Lavana issued out of his city to\\n collect food. In the meantime having crossed the river Yamunā, the\\n heroic Satrughna, with bow in his hands, stood at the gate of Madhu’s\\n city. Thereupon returning in the noon with many thousand animals, the\\n night-ranger Lavana, of dreadful actions, espied Satrughna standing at\\n the gate with a weapon in his hand. Thereupon he said:—\"What shall thou\\n do with this weapon? O vile wight, enraged I have devoured many thousand\\n persons holding weapons like thee. I now perceive thou hast also been\\n possessed by Kāla. O vile man, I am fully fed. How shall thou, of thy\\n own accord, enter into my mouth?\" Lavana having said this again and\\n again laughing the great hero Satrughna shed tears in anger. The\\n high-minded Satrughna being beside himself with rage, from all his\\n person issued burning lustre. Greatly enraged he said to the\\n night-ranger \"O thou of a vicious intellect, I wish to enter into a duel\\n encounter with thee. I am the son of the great king Daçaratha, brother\\n of the intelligent Rāma and my name is Satrughna. I slay all my enemies\\n and have come here to destroy thee. I wish now to fight with thee—do\\n thou enter into a duel conflict. Thou art the enemy of all animals. Thou\\n shall not be able to survive at my hands.\" He having said this, the\\n Rākshasa, laughing aloud, replied unto that foremost of men;—\"Thy\\n understanding is bewildered. By the influence of destiny thou hast come\\n under my control. The Rākshasa Rāvana was the brother of my aunts, o\\n thou of vicious understanding, O vile wight, it is for his wife that\\n Rāma did slay him. It is out of hatred that I have tolerated the\\n destruction of Rāvana’s family and have pardoned you all. You are all\\n vile men; I have slain and defeated all of your family that have passed\\n away and shall destroy all that are living and shall come into\\n existence. O thou of vicious intellect, if thou wishest I shall fight\\n with thee. Do thou wait here so long I do not bring my weapon. Do thou\\n remain here as long as I with that shall not kill thee.\" Whereto\\n Satrughna immediately replied \"Where shalt thou go while I am alive? The\\n practical men should never let off the enemies who come out of their own\\n accord. He, who inviteth an enemy into battle under the influence of\\n perverted understanding is slain like a coward. Do thou behold this\\n world of creatures to thy hearts’ content for I shall by various sharp\\n weapons despatch thee to Yama’s abode who is the enemy of the three\\n worlds and Rāghava.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 81: '## SECTION LXXXII.\\n \\n \\n Hearing the words of the high-souled Satrughna Lavana was greatly\\n enraged and again and again asked him to wait. And clashing his hands\\n and grinding his teeth he invited that foremost of Raghus, Satrughna, to\\n fight. And Satrughna, the slayer of celestial’s enemies, said to the\\n dreadful Lavana, giving vent to those words:—\"Satrughna was not born\\n when thou didst defeat other kings; do thou therefore proceed to Death’s\\n abode being assailed by shafts. O thou of a vicious soul, as did the\\n celestials behold Rāvana slain so shall the Rishis and learned Brahmans\\n behold thee, destroyed by me. O Rākshasa, forsooth shall good crown\\n cities and villages when thou shalt fall down burnt by my arrows. As the\\n rays of the sun enter into lotus so shall arrows, hard as lightning,\\n discharged by my hands, shall enter into thy heart.\" Being beside\\n himself with ire on hearing those words of Satrughna, Lavana threw a\\n huge tree against his breast. And Satrughna too sundered it into a\\n hundred pieces. Beholding his own action baffled the Rākshasa again took\\n up many trees and hurled them at Satrughna, who, with three or four\\n hundred bent arrows, cut them all, one by one, into pieces. Thereupon\\n when the powerful Satrughna assailed him with arrows the Rākshasa was\\n not the least pained. Rather laughing aloud the valiant Rākshasa\\n uprooted a tree and struck him with that on the head. With that stroke\\n he was wounded and slain. And that hero falling there arose a terrible\\n uproar amongst the Rishis, celestials, Gandharvas and Apsarās. Thereupon\\n considering Satrughna slain the night-ranger did not enter his house\\n albeit he got the opportunity; and moreover beholding him fallen and\\n destroyed he did not take up his dart. He then began to carry his\\n collected food. Regaining his sense within a moment, Satrughna, with a\\n weapon in his hand, stood at the city gate and the Rishis began to\\n praise him. Thereupon, he having taken up an excellent arrow of\\n unfailing aim the ten quarters were filled with its native brilliance.\\n Its face was like lightning and its velocity the same and it looked like\\n Meru and Mandara; its joints were all bent. None could defeat it in\\n battle. It was pasted with red sandal resembling blood and its feathers\\n were beautiful. Beholding that dart like unto the fire of dissolution,\\n and dreadful like unto the lords of Dānavas, mountains and Asuras, the\\n creatures were greatly terrified. What more, being disturbed, the\\n celestials, Asuras, Gandharvas, saints and Apsarās and all other\\n creatures of the world approached the Great Patriarch, the conferrer of\\n boons and said;—\"The fear of the celestials and the destruction of the\\n creatures hath arrived.\" Hearing those words the Patriarch Brahma\\n replied \"Although it is a source of great fear still it is not dreadful\\n unto the celestials.\" Thereupon with sweet accents he said:—\"Hear, O ye\\n celestials, Satrughna hath taken up this arrow for the destruction of\\n Lavana. By the energy thereof we have all been overwhelmed. This\\n effulgent, ever-existing arrow was made by the Primeval Deity Vishnu—the\\n lord of creatures. My children, the burning arrow, of which you are\\n afraid, was made by the high-minded Vishnu for slaying the demons Madhu\\n and Kaitabha. And Vishnu alone is cognizant of its energy. This\\n Satrughna is the first portion of Vishnu’s person; do ye all go hence\\n and behold the destruction of the foremost Rākshasa, Lavana, by the\\n high-souled, heroic Satrughna, the younger brother of Rāma.\" Hearing the\\n words of the Patriarch Brahmā, the celestials arrived at the\\n battle-field of Satrughna and Lavana and saw that the arrow, held by\\n Satrughna’s hands, was burning like the fire of dissolution. Beholding\\n the welkin covered by the celestials, Satrughna, the descendant of\\n Raghu, emitting leonine roars, again and again looked towards Lavana.\\n And being again excited by the high-souled Satrughna and enraged Lavana\\n arrived for encounter. Thereupon expanding his bow up to ears,\\n Satrughna, the most accomplished archer, discharged his arrow against\\n the spacious breast of Lavana. And piercing his heart that arrow entered\\n speedily into Rasātala And having entered Rasātala that arrow, honored\\n by the celestials, again came to the descendant of Raghu. And being\\n pierced by that shaft the night-ranger Lavana fell down on earth like a\\n mountain clapped by a thunder-bolt. The Rākshasa being slain that\\n celestial, huge arrow came into the possession of Rudra before the gods.\\n Having removed the fear of the three worlds with one shaft, that heroic\\n Raghu, Satrughna—younger brother of Lakshmana, holding excellent bow and\\n arrow, appeared like the Sun of thousand rays removing darkness.\\n Thereupon chanting the glories of Satrughna, the celestials, Rishis,\\n Pannagas, Apsarās, said \"O son of Daçaratha, it is really fortunate,\\n that thou, renouncing fear, hast acquired victory and that the Rākshasa\\n Lavana hath been vanquished like a serpent.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 82: '## SECTION LXXXIII.\\n \\n \\n Lavana being slain the celestials headed by Agni and Indra said in sweet\\n accents to Satrughna the represser of enemies:—\"O child, fortunate it is\\n that thou hast been crowned with success after slaying the Rākshasa\\n Lavana. Do thou, therefore, O foremost of men, O thou of firm vows,\\n accept boons. O thou having long arms, all those who can confer boons\\n have arrived here; they all wish for thy victory; seeing us doth not go\\n without fruits.\" Hearing the words of the celestials the large-armed and\\n self-controlled Satrughna placed his hands on his head and said.—\"Let\\n this picturesque and charming city of Madhu, built by the celestials, be\\n my capital; this is the only excellent boon I can beg.\" The celestials,\\n with a delighted heart, said to the descendant of Raghu:—\"Thy desire\\n shall be fulfilled and forsooth shall thy city be turned into a\\n picturesque capital under the name of Surashena.\" The high-souled\\n celestials having ascended the welkin saying this, the highly effulgent\\n Satrughna brought the soldiers there, that were encamped on the banks of\\n the Ganges. When the soldiers arrived there on hearing the commands of\\n Satrughna he engaged in making encampments in the month of Srāban. In\\n this wise the fearlessness of the celestial host, taking the shape of a\\n country, that beautiful and picturesque city was reared in the course of\\n twelve years. All the fields there were filled with crops and Indra\\n began to pour showers in due season. And being protected by the strength\\n of Satrughna’s arms all men there became valiant and were freed from\\n diseases. That city on the banks of Yamunā appeared beautiful like the\\n half moon and was filled with yards, shops, streets beautiful houses,\\n men of four orders and various articles of trade. Satrughna now engaged\\n in beautifying the spacious, white houses that were made by Lavana\\n before, with various ornamental works. Beholding the city interspersed\\n with various excellent gardens, pleasure grounds and prosperously filled\\n with celestials and men and diverse articles of trade and merchants\\n hailing from various countries, Satrughna, the younger brother of\\n Bharata, attained to the satisfaction of desire and excess of delight.\\n Having thus reared the beautiful city he resolved within himself \"The\\n twelfth year has come. I shall now behold the feet of Rāma.\" Thereupon\\n having set up the city resembling the region of the celestials and\\n filled with various men, the king Satrughna, the enhancer of Raghu’s\\n race, determined on beholding Rāma’s feet.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 83: '## SECTION LXXXIV.\\n \\n \\n Thereupon on the completion of the twelfth year, Satrughna, with few\\n servants, soldiers and followers, desired to proceed to Ayodhyā\\n protected by Rāma. Having prevented his minister and leading generals he\\n proceeded with one hundred chariots and cavalry. And having counted\\n seven halting stations on his way, the highly illustrious descendant of\\n Raghu—Satrughna, arrived at the hermitage of Vālmiki. And having bowed\\n unto the feet of the leading Muni, that foremost of men took from his\\n hands water to wash feet and _Arghya_ and accepted his hospitality. The\\n great ascetic Vālmiki addressed to the high-souled Satrughna many sweet\\n words. Having referred at first to Lavana’s destruction, he\\n said:—\"Having slain Lavana thou hast performed a very hard work. O\\n gentle one, O foremost of men, Lavana had slain in conflict many hundred\\n highly powerful kings with their army and conveyances. And thou hast\\n easily slain that vicious-souled Rākshasa, Lavana. By thy prowess the\\n whole world hath been divested of fear. With great difficulty Rāma had\\n slain Rāvana—but without any trouble whatsoever thou hast accomplished\\n this mighty work. Lavana being slain, the celestials have been greatly\\n delighted—what more the well-being of the whole universe and all\\n creatures has been brought about. O Rāghava, O foremost of men, being\\n present in the assemblage of Vasava—I duly witnessed your combat. O\\n Satrughna, I too have been greatly delighted—I therefore smell thy crown\\n for this is the best expression of love.\" Saying this the high-minded\\n Vālmiki smelled his crown and made arrangements for his reception as\\n well as that of his followers. After meals, Satrughna, the foremost of\\n men, listened to themes relating to Rāma and set in musical notes. Those\\n themes were composed describing the early actions of Rāma. They were\\n composed in Sanskrit, set to the tune of a musical instrument, adorned\\n with all the marks of vocal music and arranged in accompaniment with\\n notes. Satrughna, the foremost of men, heard them from the beginning to\\n the end, pregnant with truth and composed of those words. And on hearing\\n it he was beside himself with joy and his eyes were full of tears. And\\n remaining stunned for some time and regaining his sense afterwards he\\n began to breathe hard out of excess of surprise. He heard, in that song,\\n of past events as things passing on. And hearing it, his followers, with\\n their heads down and sorrowfully said:—\"Wonder,\" and saying this they\\n began to converse with one another:—\"Alas! Where are we? Is this a\\n dream? We have been hearing at this hermitage what we had not seen\\n before. What wonder, that in a dream we hear such an excellent song.\"\\n Being in this wise greatly surprised they said to Satrughna:—\"O foremost\\n of men, do thou ask particularly, about this, Vālmiki, the foremost of\\n ascetics.\" They being all thus struck with curiosity, Satrughna\\n said:—\"It is not proper for us, O Ye soldiers, to question him in this\\n way. There are many such wonders in the hermitage of this ascetic. It is\\n not therefore becoming to ask him about this out of curiosity.\" Having\\n thus addressed the soldiers and bowed unto the ascetic, Satrughna, the\\n desendant of Raghu, entered his own quarter.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 84: '## SECTION LXXXV.\\n \\n \\n Thereupon going to bed, Satrughna began to meditate upon that excellent\\n theme relating to Rāma and treating of diverse subjects and did not\\n enter into sleep. In sooth the high-minded Satrughna spent the night in\\n no time listening to that charming song set in musical notes. The night\\n being over, he first went through the morning rites and then with folded\\n hands addressed the foremost of ascetics, Vālmiki, saying:—\"O\\n illustrious Sir, I am anxious to see Rāma, the enhancer of the delight\\n of the Raghu race. And my desire is that thou mayst with other\\n illustrious Rishis, grant me permission on this.\" Satrughna, the slayer\\n of enemies, having said this, the great ascetic Vālmiki embraced and\\n bade him farewell. He was greatly anxious to behold Rāma and saluting\\n the foremost of Munis he speedily proceeded to Ayodhyā. Thereupon having\\n entered the highly picturesque city Ayodhyā, the graceful descendant of\\n Ikshwākus, Satrughna reached where the long-armed and the highly\\n effulgent Rāma was waiting. He espied there Rāma in the midst of the\\n councillors like Indra amongst the immortals burning in his own\\n effulgence. And having bowed with folded hands unto Rāma, having truth\\n for his prowess, Satrughna said:—\"O great king, I have carried out all\\n thine behests; I have slain the vicious Lavana and filled his city with\\n subjects. O descendant of Raghu, twelve years have passed away without\\n thee—I do not wish to live any longer separated from thee. Do thou\\n therefore, O Kākuthstha of unmitigated prowess, have compassion on me.\\n Without thee, I cannot live for ever in a foreign province like a\\n motherless child.\" He having said this, Rāma embraced him and said:—\"Be\\n not sorry, O hero. This is not a becoming action for Kshatriyas. The\\n kings, O Rāghava, are never tired of living in a foreign land. According\\n to the morality of the Kshatriyas, their greatest duty consists in\\n governing the subjects. O heroic and foremost of men, do thou, at\\n intervals, come to Ayodhyā to see me and return to thy own city.\\n Forsooth thou art dearer than my life. But it is an incumbent duty to\\n govern the kingdom. Do thou therefore, O Kākutstha, live with me for\\n seven nights, and afterwards return to thy city with thy servants, army\\n and conveyances.\" Hearing those moral and charming words of Rāma,\\n Satrughna poorly replied, saying:—\"Thy command shall be carried out.\"\\n Thereupon Satrughna, well-skilled in the use of bows, remained with Rāma\\n for seven nights and then addressed himself for departure. Thereupon\\n having invited Bharata and Lakshmana, the high-souled Rāma, having truth\\n for his prowess, speedily went for his city in a huge chariot. The\\n high-souled Lakshmana and Bharata followed him on foot for some\\n distance.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 85: '## SECTION LXXXVI.\\n \\n \\n Having bade adieu unto Satrughna, Rāma, the descendant of Raghu, was\\n greatly delighted by governing his subjects piously in the company of\\n Bharata and Lakshmana. Some days having passed in this wise—a villager,\\n an old Brahman, arrived at the palace gate with a dead body. That\\n Brahman, stricken with affection, again and again bewailed in various\\n piteous accents, exclaiming \"What heinous crime had I committed in my\\n pristine birth that I have been constrained to witness the death of my\\n son. My son, thou hast not as yet completed fourteen years. To my misery\\n thou hast met with untimely death. Forsooth, for thy grief, O my son,\\n myself and thy mother shall soon be snatched away by death. I do not\\n remember to have ever uttered a falsehood, or injured an animal or\\n perpetrated any other crime. Therefore for some other sinful action,\\n this boy, without performing the son’s duties towards his parents, has\\n gone to the abode of death. Save under the regime of Rāma, I have never\\n seen or heard of the dreadful death of such a boy who hath not attained\\n the age. Forsooth, Rāma hath perpetrated a mighty iniquity for which\\n boys, during his administration, have been meeting with untimely death.\\n In other governments boys have no fear of such an untimely death.\\n Therefore, O king confer life upon this dead child. Or else with my\\n spouse I shall renounce my life at this gate like one having no lord. O\\n Rāma, soiled by the sin consequent upon the destruction of a Brāhmana,\\n do thou live long happily with brothers. O thou of great prowess, up to\\n this time we have lived happily in thy kingdom. And now, O Rāma, under\\n thy subjection we are being troubled with the sorrow of our son’s death.\\n We have been brought under the influence of Kāla; so in thy kingdom\\n there is not the least happiness for us. Having attained Rāma as its\\n lord, the kingdom, of the high-souled Ikshwākus, hath attained to the\\n condition of one having no master, where during Rāma’s regime the death\\n of a boy hath been brought about. For being impiously governed by a\\n king, for his sin, the subjects meet with calamities. And a king\\n following evil tracks and not governing the subjects righteously people\\n meet with untimely death. Therefore, when a king doth not suppress the\\n crimes committed by people either in cities or provinces the fear, of\\n untimely death, comes in. Evident it is therefore that undoubtedly the\\n sin of the king hath appeared in cities and provinces. And for that\\n reason this boy hath met with death.\" Being overwhelmed with sorrow that\\n old Brahman again and again remonstrated with the king in these piteous\\n words and afterwards covered the death body (of his son).\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 86: '## SECTION LXXXVII.\\n \\n \\n Hearing those sorrowful words of the Brahman, Rāma was greatly sorry and\\n sent for Vasishtha, Bāmadeva, his brothers, citizens and councillors.\\n Thereupon having entered the apartment in the company of Vasishtha,\\n eight Brahmans blessed the king Rāma, resembling a celestial, saying\\n \"May victory crown thee.\" Mārkandeya, Maudgalya, Bāmadeva, Kashyapa,\\n Kātyāyana, Javali, Gautama, and Narada—these eight leading Brāhmanas\\n having taken their seats, Rāma, with folded hands, saluted them. And he\\n showed due civilities towards his minister, citizens, Rishis and all\\n others. Thereupon all the highly effulgent Rishis being accomodated with\\n seats Rāma narrated duly before them the account of the Brāhmana and\\n said. \"This Brahman is waiting at the Palace-gate.\" Hearing those words\\n of the poorly king, Nārada, in the presence of all other Rishis,\\n replied:—\"Hear, king, why this boy hath met with untimely death. And\\n hearing this, O descendant of Raghu, do thou settle what thou thinkest\\n proper. O king, in the golden age, only the Brahmans used to engage in\\n asceticism. At that age, save the Brāhmanas no other caste used to lead\\n the life of an anchoret. And for this, the Brahmans were the highest\\n caste, effulgent in asceticism, shorn of ignorance, above death and\\n conversant with three ages. Thereupon at the end of the golden age,\\n Brāhmana’s understanding became loose and the Tretā Yuga set in. At this\\n age Kshatryas, gifted with the power acquired by pristine asceticism,\\n were born. And those men, intent upon austere penances, that were born\\n in the Tretā age, were more powerful and greater devotees than those in\\n the former age. In the golden age the Brāhmanas were more powerful than\\n the Kshatryas. But in the Tretā age the Brāhmanas and the Kshatryas were\\n equally powerful. Thus in the Tretā age, not beholding prominence of the\\n Brāhmanas greater than that of the Kshatryas, Manu and other religious\\n leaders of the time composed the Sastra describing and setting in the\\n four divisions of castes. In this wise the Tretā age was prolific with\\n virtues of the four Varnas, and many pious sacrifices and was shorn of\\n iniquities. But being attacked a little with iniquity, one portion of\\n sin appeared on earth. And growing impious people lost their strength.\\n And for houses and farms that were the property of the former age,\\n people of the Tretā Yuga were possessed by envy, the outcome of the\\n quality of darkness. And with the fading of impiety on earth during\\n Tretā, the soiled sin of untruth appeared. And this iniquity stretching\\n one footstep, the lease of people’s lives, for sins, became limited. And\\n the sin of untruth descending on earth, people, to avoid the extinction\\n of life in consequence thereof, became truthful and engaged in many\\n pious observances. During the Tretā age the Brāhmanas and Kshatryas\\n engaged in austere penances and the Vaisyas and Sudras engaged in\\n serving them. And the greatest piety of the Vaisyas and Sudras at that\\n time consisted of serving the Brāhmanas and Kshatryas and specially for\\n the Sudras the highest religion was to serve people of all Varnas. O\\n foremost of kings, at the end of the Tretā age, Vaisyas and Sudras being\\n fully overpowered by the sin of untruth, the Brāhmanas and the Kshatryas\\n also grew feeble. And the second foot of impiety being ushered into the\\n world the Dwāpara age set in. O foremost of men, during this age two\\n legs of piety being cut off, impiety and untruth multiplied. And in Yuga\\n named Dwāpara the Vaisyas engaged in devout penances. In this wise in\\n three ages the three Varnas gradually engaged in ascetic performances.\\n The piety of asceticism by Yugas gradually became established in three\\n Varnas. But, O foremost of men, in these three Yugas the Sudras were not\\n entitled to the virtues of devout penances. O foremost of men, the\\n degraded caste—the Sudras, during thy regime, have engaged in austere\\n penances. And in the Kali Yuga asceticism shall be established in the\\n Sudras. O king, even in the Dwāpara, devout penances for Sudras were\\n considered as impiety, what to speak of the Tretā age. O king, one\\n Sudra, under the influence of vicious understanding has begun devout\\n penances within thy kingdom. And for that reason this boy hath met with\\n death. Calamity sets in that kingdom where a vicious-minded person\\n commits an iniquity and that vicious wight and the king forsooth\\n speedily repair to hell. The king, who piously governeth his subjects,\\n receiveth the sixth portion of their study, asceticism and good actions.\\n While the king is entitled to the sixth portion of everything why should\\n he not fully protect his subjects? Therefore, O chief of men, do thou\\n bring all informations of thy kingdom. And be then studious to repress\\n vices wherever thou shalt find them. And by that, O foremost of men, the\\n piety of the subjects shall be increased, the lease of their life shall\\n be prolonged and this boy shall regain his life.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 87: '## SECTION LXXXVIII.\\n \\n \\n Hearing the sweet words of the celestial saint Nārada Rāma was greatly\\n delighted and addressing Lakshmana said:—\"O gentle one, do thou console\\n that foremost of twice-born ones and place the dead body of the boy in a\\n jar full of oil. Let this body be protected by sweet-scented oil so that\\n it might not be soiled by any means. See that it is not disfigured, its\\n joints are not loosened and the hairs do not fall off.\" The highly\\n illustrious Rāma, the descendant of Ikshwākus, thus commanded Lakshmana,\\n gifted with auspicious marks, and thought of his car and desired it to\\n come soon. Understanding his intention the golden car appeared before\\n him in no time and saluting him said:—\"O thou of long arms, thine\\n chariot hath come.\" Hearing the sweet words of Pushpaka the king Rāma\\n saluted the great ascetics, ascended the car with his burning bow,\\n quiver and dagger and left Bharata and Lakshmana in charge of the city.\\n And searching that Sudra devotee here and there Rāghava proceeded\\n towards the west. And not beholding him there he went to the North\\n bounded by the Himalayas. And even there he did not espy the Sudra\\n ascetic and even the smallest iniquity was not seen there. Thereupon\\n returning from that quarter the king journeyed the whole of east. And\\n having sat on the Pushpaka car he saw that the eastern quarter was\\n transparent like a looking glass and there was not the best touch of\\n sin. From the east Rāghava proceeded towards the south and espied a big\\n tank by the side of the Saivala mountain. On the banks of that pond one\\n ascetic was performing the most austere penances with his legs upwards\\n and head downwards. Thereupon approaching him, Rāma said—\"O thou of good\\n vows, blessed art thou; I do ask thee, now, O thou highly effulgent and\\n grown old old in asceticism, in what Varna thou art born. I put this\\n question out of curiosity. I am the son of king Daçaratha and my name is\\n Rāma. For what art thou going through such hard austerities? Is it\\n heaven or anything else that thou prayest for? O ascetic, I wish to hear\\n of the purpose for which thou art performing such hard penances. Art\\n thou a Brahman, or an irrepresible Kshatriya or the third caste Vaisya\\n or a Sudra? Do thou speak the truth and thou shaft be crowned with\\n auspiciousness.\" Hearing the words of Rāma, the ascetic, whose face was\\n downwards, gave out his degraded birth and communicated unto him for\\n what he was performing ascetic observances.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 88: '## SECTION LXXXV.\\n \\n \\n Hearing the words of Rāma of unwearied actions, the ascetic, with his\\n face downwards, said:—\"O highly illustrious Rāma, I am born in the race\\n of Sudras; and with a view to reach the region of the celestials with my\\n body I am going through these austere penances. O Kākuthstha, I shall\\n never utter a falsehood since I am willing to conquer the the region of\\n gods. I am a Sudra and my name is Sambuka.\" The Sudra ascetic having\\n said this, Rāma took out of scabbard a beautiful sharp sword and chopped\\n off his head therewith. And that Sudra being slain, Indra, Agni and\\n other celestials praised him again and again and showered flowers. And\\n being greatly delighted, the celestials said to Rāma, having truth for\\n his prowess:—\"O thou of a great mind, thou hast nicely performed this\\n god-like work. O slayer of foes, do thou now crave a boon. O descendant\\n of Raghu, being slain by thee this Sudra hath been able to attain to the\\n abode of the celestials.\" Hearing the words of the deities, Rāma, having\\n truth for his prowess, said with folded hands to Purandara, of a\\n thousand eyes:—\"If the celestials are pleased, I beg for this boon that\\n the son of the twice-born one may be restored to life. Do ye confer upon\\n me this boon; this is my wished-for object. It is for my iniquitous\\n conduct that this only son of the Brahman hath met with untimely death.\\n Do ye restore him to life. I have promised before that leading\\n twice-born one that I would restore his son to life—do ye therefore,\\n make not me a liar.\" Hearing the words of Rāma the leading celestials\\n delightedly said:—\"Do thou return, O Kākutstha. The Brahmin boy shall\\n immediately gain back his life and be united with his father, mother and\\n friends. O Rāghava, with the death of the Sudra the boy has regained his\\n life. Be thou at ease; may good betide thee. O foremost of men, we, too,\\n return with delighted hearts. O Rāghava, we desire to behold the\\n hermitage of the great saint Agastya. Having been initiated, that highly\\n effulgent Brahman saint hath lived within waters for twelve years; his\\n vow hath now terminated. O Kākuthstha, we shall now go to welcome that\\n Muni. Do thou also follow us to see that saint.\" Saying \"So be it!\" to\\n the words of the celestials that descendant of Raghu ascended his golden\\n car Pushpaka. And having ascended spacious cars the celestials proceeded\\n to the hermitage of Agastya born of a _Kumbha_. Rāma too also followed\\n them. Thereupon beholding the celestials present the virtuous-souled\\n Agastya, the jewel of asceticism, welcomed them particularly. Having\\n accepted his worship and adored in return that great Muni, the\\n immortals, delighted, proceeded to their abodes with their followers.\\n The celestials having departed Rāma descended from Pushpaka and saluted\\n that effulgent and foremost of Rishis Agastya. And having received due\\n hospitality he sat there. Thereupon the highly effulgent and leading\\n ascetic Kumbhajoni said:—\"O Rāghava, I have been greatly delighted with\\n thy coming. By my good fortune I have seen thee to-day. O Rāma, I love\\n thee because thou art gifted with many qualities. O king, thou art my\\n worshipful guest. I was thinking of thee. The celestials informed me\\n that thou wert coming having slain the Sudra ascetic. Thou hast observed\\n piety and hast given back life unto the dead child of the Brahman. Do\\n thou spend this night with me, O Rāghava. Thou art the graceful\\n Nārāyana. In thee the whole universe is established. Thou art the lord\\n of all creatures and the eternal Purusha. Thou shalt go to thy city next\\n morning in thy Pushpaka car. This ornament, O gentle one, hath been made\\n by the architect of the celestials; its make is very beautiful and it is\\n dazzling by its own lustre. By accepting this, O Kākutstha, do thou\\n satisfy my desire. It is said that one attains to best fruits if he\\n makes present unto his deity, of best articles he gets from another.\\n Thou art the only worthy person to use this ornament. Thou art alone\\n capable of conferring best fruits. Thou dost protect Indra and other\\n celestials. Therefore I do duly present thee with this ornament. O king,\\n do thou accept it.\" Thereupon meditating upon the duties of the\\n Kshatryas, the heroic Rāma, the foremost of the intelligent, said:—\"O\\n illustrious Sir, the Brāhmanas only can accept presents—how can the\\n Kshatryas do? To take gifts is the function of the Brāhmanas—for\\n Kshatryas it is a source of censure. Besides, to receive presents from a\\n Brāhmana, is highly culpable. Do thou therefore tell me, how I may\\n accept this ornament.\" Hearing the words of Rāma, the great saint\\n Agastya replied saying:—\"O Rāma, O son of Daçaratha, at the beginning of\\n the golden age, people had no king; but Vāsava was the ruler of the\\n celestials. Therefore to obtain a king, men approached Brahmā, the god\\n of gods and said ’O deity thou hast placed Indra as ruler over the\\n celestials; therefore, O lord of creatures, do thou also confer upon us\\n a king who shall be foremost among men; by worshipping him we shall be\\n freed from all sins. We shall not live without the king—even this is our\\n firm resolution.’ Thereupon the Patriarch Brahmā sent for Indra and\\n other deities and said:—’Do ye all give a portion of your respective\\n energies.’ Thereupon the deities gave each a portion of their own\\n energies. Thereupon Brahma made a _Khshupa_ or sound and therefrom\\n originated a king under the name of _Khshupa_. And in his person Brahmā\\n placed in equal proportions the energies of the deities. Thereafter he\\n made _Khshupa_ the foremost king of men. By virtue of the portion of\\n Indra’s energy the king _Khshupa_ brought the earth under his control;\\n by that of Varuna’s energy he fostered his own body; by Kuvera’s portion\\n he conferred riches upon his subjects; and by that of Yama he governed\\n them. Therefore, O Rāma, by virtue of Indra’s portion, do thou accept\\n this ornament and confer upon me the salvation.\" Hearing the words of\\n the Muni, Rāma took from him that brilliant celestial ornament burning\\n like the rays of the Sun. And having taken that excellent ornament,\\n Dāçarathi asked the great saint Kumbhayoni, saying:—\"Whence hast thou\\n obtained this celestial ornament of a wondrous make? Who hast given thee\\n this? Brahman, I do accost thee thus out of curiosity. Thou art the mine\\n of many wonders.\" Whereto Agastya replied, saying \"Hearken, O Rāma, how\\n I did obtain this ornament in the Tretā age.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 89: '## SECTION XC.\\n \\n \\n \"O Rāma, in Tretā age, there was a huge forest extending over a hundred\\n Yojanas divested of animals and men. In that forest I used to perform my\\n austere penances. Once on a time I began to roam all over the forest\\n being willing to see well every nook and corner of it. And I saw that it\\n was impossible to ascertain how very pleasant that forest was. In every\\n place there were trees with profuse sweet fruits and roots. In the\\n middle I espied a pond extending over a Yojana. There was no moss in\\n that deep, calm, clear and sweet water; there were lotuses and lilies\\n and swans, Kārandāvas, Chakravakas and many other water fowls were\\n playing in the waters. O lord of creatures, at no distance from that\\n pond I saw an old, holy hermitage but there was no creature or animal\\n around it. It was summer and I spent that night in that hermitage. Next\\n morning leaving my bed I arrived at the banks of the pond and saw a\\n plump dead body in the waters. None of its limbs was pale and its beauty\\n was not spoiled. Beholding it and standing on the banks I began to\\n meditate upon it. And thought I ’What is this?’ In a moment I espied a\\n beautiful car, swift-coursing like the mind and drawn by ganders. And I\\n saw in that chariot a celestial person. He was being attended by\\n Apasaras adorned with celestial ornaments and having lotus-eyes. Some of\\n them were singing, some dancing and some playing on Mridanga, Vina and\\n other musical instruments and some were fanning his lotus-like\\n countenance with valuable, golden chowries, dazzling like the rays of\\n the moon. O Rāma, the foremost of Raghu’s race, like unto the moon\\n renouncing the summit of the Sumeru mount that celestial wight got down\\n from his seat in the car and engaged in devouring the dead body. And\\n having taken enough flesh he got down into waters and duly performed\\n ablution. And thereafter that heavenly being again addressed himself for\\n ascending the car. O foremost of men, beholding that heavenly being\\n about to get up I accosted him, saying ‘Who art thou? I see, thou hast a\\n celestial form, then why hast thou taken such an abominable food? O thou\\n adored of the immortals, persons like thee should not take such meals. O\\n gentle one, I have been striken with great curiosity and wish to hear\\n all. Thine living upon dead body doth not appear agreeable unto me.’ O\\n king, plainly and out of curiosity I put to him these questions. And\\n hearing them, the celestial being related everything unto me.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 90: '## SECTION CXI.\\n \\n \\n \"O Rāma, hearing my words pregnant with sound reasoning, that heavenly\\n being, with folded hands, said ’Hear, O Brahman, from what unavoidable\\n cause hath proceeded this happy and again painful incident. There\\n flourished in the days of yore a highly illustrious and powerful\\n Vidarbha king under the name of Sudeva known over three worlds. He was\\n my father. His two queens gave birth to two sons. My name is Sweta and\\n the name of my youngest brother was Suratha. After the decease of my\\n sire the subjects installed me on the throne and I governed them piously\\n and carefully for a thousand years. By some reason I was informed of the\\n extent of my life. And when I perceived that the lease of my life had\\n well-nigh expired I entered into the life of Banaprasta. And having\\n placed my brother Suratha on the throne I entered into a dense forest\\n devoid of men and animals at no distance from this pond to perform\\n devout penances. And I performed austerities for a long time near this\\n pond. Having performed hard penances in this forest, for three thousand\\n years I at last attained to the region of Brahmā. And albeit I had\\n reached the Brahmā region I was still being assailed by hunger and\\n thirst. And gradually I grew tired therewith. Thereupon approaching the\\n patriarch Brahmā, the lord of three worlds, I said:—\"O Brahmā, here\\n there is no hunger or thirst; still why have I been brought to their\\n control? Of what iniquity of mine is this fruit? O deity, tell me upon\\n what I shall live?\" Whereto the patriarch replied;—\"O son of Sudeva, do\\n thou live upon sweet savoured meat everyday? O Sweta, thou didst only\\n look to the growth of thy person when thou didst perform rigid penances.\\n O thou of a great mind, nothing grows, when nothing is sown. Thou didst\\n only perform ascetic penances, but thou didst not make any gift of\\n charity. It is for that reason, O my son, that thou art, even in heaven,\\n being assailed by hunger and thirst. Thereupon do thou now live upon\\n thine own dead body fostered by various food. By this thou shalt keep up\\n thy being. O Sweta, thou shalt be relieved from this affliction when the\\n irrepressible, great Saint Agastya shall reach that forest. O gentle\\n one, even unto the immortals he can give salvation; what wonder it is\\n that he shall relieve thee from the miseries of hunger and thirst.\" O\\n foremost of twice-born ones, from the time of hearing those words of the\\n great Brahmā, the god of gods, I have been engaged in this cursed work\\n of feeding upon my own dead body. O Brahman, for many long years I have\\n been living upon this corpse still I have not done with it. O Saint, I,\\n too, derive satisfaction from it; I now understand that thou art the\\n illustrious Agastya born of a Kumbha; for none else is capable of coming\\n here; do thou therefore save me from this pain, who am afflicted with\\n great miseries. O foremost of twice-born ones, O gentle one, do thou\\n take this ornament; may good betide thee. Do thou be propitiated with\\n me. O Brahman, I do confer upon thee, gold, riches various clothes,\\n eatables, excellent ornaments and diverse other objects of desire and\\n enjoyment. O foremost of Munis, do thou with compassion save me.’\\n Hearing those words of the heavenly being, exciting pity, I accepted\\n this ornament for saving him. And as soon as I took this ornament that\\n human body of the royal saint disappeared. And the body being dissolved,\\n the royal saint Sweta, greatly delighted, happily went to the land of\\n immortals. It is for this reason, O Kākutstha, that royal saint,\\n resembling Indra, conferred upon me this wondrous, celestial ornament.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 91: '## SECTION CXII.\\n \\n \\n Hearing the wondrous words of the great saint Kumbhayoni, Rāma, out of\\n great curiosity and importance of the subject, again asked him,\\n saying:—\"O Brahman, why was that dense forest, in which the king Sweta\\n used to perform hard penances, divested of birds and animals? And how\\n did he proceed to that forest devoid of men and animals for undergoing\\n penances? I wish to hear the truth.\" Hearing the words of Rāma stricken\\n with curiosity, the highly effulgent saint Agastya said:—\"O Rāma,\\n formerly in the golden age, Manu was the king. His son was Ikshwāku.\\n Having installed the irrepressible Ikshwāku, Manu said: ’Be thou the\\n lord over creatures.’ Saying ’So be it’ Ikshwāku accepted the command.\\n Thereupon greatly delighted Manu said to his son:—’I have been highly\\n pleased with thee. For sooth thou shalt become a very liberal prince.\\n Thou shalt govern the subjects meting out proper punishment unto them,\\n but do not punish them without any fault. If the punishment, which a\\n king inflicts upon the guilty, be just it becomes the instrumental in\\n taking the giver to heaven. Therefore, O my son having large arms, be\\n particularly studious as regards punishment for thereby thou shalt\\n acquire great piety.’ Having in this wise advised Ikshwāku Manu\\n delightedly repaired to the region of Brahmā. After Manu’s departure,\\n the effulgent Ikshwāku thought of the means for creating progeny.\\n Thereupon performing many pious rites Manu’s son engendered a hundred\\n sons. O descendant of Raghu, the youngest of all those sons became\\n stupid and ignorant and did not respect his elder brothers. And thinking\\n that he should therefore be punished he named this son ’Danda.’\\n Thereupon finding no other province worthy of Danda he allotted the\\n region between Vindhya and Saivala to him. Danda became king of that\\n picturesque valley. And having reared a fine city there he named it as\\n Madhumanta and appointed Sukracharja of firm vows as his priest. Having\\n thus established his kingdom, Danda, with his priest, began to lord over\\n it filled with healthy and delighted people like unto the lord of\\n celestials in their region. O Rāma, like unto Mahendra governing his\\n kingdom of heaven under the guidance of Vrihaspati, the preceptor of\\n celestials, Danda, the grand-son of Manu, governed his own kingdom with\\n the help of Usanās.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 92: '## SECTION XCIII.\\n \\n \\n Having related this story unto Rāma the great saint Agastya again\\n said:—\"O Kākutstha, having subdued his passions, the king Danda, reigned\\n undisturbed in this wise for many long years. Thereupon during spring,\\n in the month of Chaitra the king arrived at the picturesque hermitage of\\n the preceptor Sukra. At that time, Sukra’s daughter, matchless in beauty\\n and grace, was walking in the forest. The king saw that jewel of a girl,\\n and being stricken with lust and growing restless he approached her and\\n said:—’O thou having a beautiful waist, O fair lady, whose daughter art\\n thou? O thou having a moonlike countenance, I have been assailed by the\\n arrows of Cupid and hence I do accost thee thus.’ Hearing the words of\\n the vicious-souled Danda, maddened with lust, Sukra’s daughter humbly\\n said:—’O king of kings I am the daughter of the preceptor Sukra of\\n unwearied actions and my name is Arajās. I am living in this\\n hermitage—king, do not touch me forcibly for I am a maid and hence under\\n the guardianship of my father. Besides my father is my preceptor, and\\n thou art also his disciple. Being enraged he shall imprecate thee with a\\n curse. O foremost of men, if thou dost cherish any desire for me, do\\n thou honestly and piously pray for it unto my sire. Or else thou shalt\\n suffer dreadful consequences in the long run. When worked up with ire,\\n my father can reduce even the three worlds to ashes. O thou of a\\n blameless person, if thou dost pray, my father may make me over unto thy\\n hands.’ Arajās having said this, the king Danda, maddened with lust,\\n placing folded palms on his head, said:—’Be thou propitiated with me, O\\n thou having a graceful person; do not tarry even for a moment. My heart\\n bursts out for thee, O thou having a moon-like countenance. For\\n acquiring thee I can even take upon myself my own destruction or\\n dreadful iniquity. Do thou seek me, O fair lady—I am beside myself for\\n thee.’ Having said this the king forcibly ravished her. Having\\n perpetrated such a mighty iniquity he speedily returned to his own city\\n Madhumanta. Arajās cried aloud in forest at no distance from the\\n hermitage and waited for her sire who had been away on visiting the\\n celestials.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",

He was stricken with hunger and was greatly\\n incensed on beholding his daughter in that wretched plight, as if\\n burning the three worlds with rage. Addressing his pupils he said:—’Do\\n ye witness today the dreadful calamity, arising out of my flaming ire,\\n of the vicious Danda treading the path of immorality. This vicious wight\\n hath placed his hands in the burning flame so he shall, along with\\n followers, meet with destruction. Since that vile being hath perpetrated\\n such a dreadful crime he shall forsooth suffer the consequence thereof.\\n Within seven nights, the wicked and vicious Danda, with his son,\\n soldiers and retinue, shall meet with death. Showering dust Indra shall\\n destroy, to the extent of a hundred Yojana, the territory of this\\n vicious king. And all creatures mobile and immobile, wherever they might\\n be, shall be destroyed with this downpour of dust. All animals as far as\\n this Dandas’ territory extends, shall be destroyed within seven nights.’\\n Having said this, with eyes reddened with ire, Usanās, Vrigu’s son, said\\n to the inmates of his hermitage:—’Do ye all go and wait outside this\\n kingdom.’ Hearing the words of the preceptor Sukra, the inmates left the\\n hermitage and lived at a place beyond the limit of Danda’s territories.\\n Having thus addressed the inmates of the hermitage the great saint, said\\n to Arajas. ’O unfortunate girl, with a devoted mind do thou wait at this\\n hermitage. Without any anxiety, O Arajās, do thou wait for the time at\\n the picturesque banks of this pond extending over a Yojana. Within seven\\n nights whoever shall approach thee, shall be destroyed with this\\n downpour of dust.’ Hearing the words of the Brāhmana saint and preceptor\\n Sukra, Arajās sorrowfully said to her father ’It shall be done.’\\n Thereupon Sukracharjya went away and lived elsewhere. According to the\\n words of the saint, the entire kingdom of Danda, with servants, army,\\n and conveyances, was destroyed within seven nights. Rāma, in the golden\\n age, the province between the mountains Vindhya and Saivala comprising\\n Danda’s territories, imprecated by the Brahman saint, in consequence of\\n the iniquity of the vicious souled, was reduced into a desert. From that\\n time it passes by the name of Dandaka forest. And it is otherwise called\\n Janasthāna because the ascetics used to perform austerities there. O\\n Rāghava, I have thus related unto thee, all thou didst ask of me. O\\n hero, the time for performing evening rites hath come. Behold foremost\\n of men, having performed ablution, the great saints, on all sides, with\\n jars full of water, are worshipping the sun.

Thereupon the great ascetic offered him as food many\\n substantial Kanda, roots, Oshadis and the holy Sāli rice. And taking\\n that nectar-like cooked rice, Rāma, the foremost of men, was greatly\\n delighted and spent the night there. Having got up in the morning and\\n performed the necessary ceremonies he approached the ascetic to bid\\n farewell, and saluting him said:—\"O great Rishi, I do crave for thy\\n permission to go to my own habitation.

I shall\\n come again some other time to free myself from sins.\" Hearing those\\n wondrous words of Rāma, Agastya having asceticism for his wealth,\\n delightedly said:—\"O Rāma these words, set in charming letters, are\\n highly wonderful. O descendant of Raghu, thou art the purifier of all\\n creatures. O Rāma, one, who beholds thee, even for a moment, becomes\\n pure and worthy of repairing to heaven.

I wish now\\n to perform a Rajshuya sacrifice, the source of religious glory, the\\n destroyer of all sins, inexhaustible and un-ending. Therefore, with you\\n like my own self, I wish to engage in the most excellent and eternal\\n Rajshuya sacrifice. O slayer of foes, by celebrating Rajshuya, Mitra\\n attained to the dignity of Varuna.

The breadth of his body\\n was a hundred Yojanas and the height thereof was three hundred Yojanas.\\n Considering all under his subjection he used to regard them with\\n affection. He was pious, grateful and used to perform nothing without\\n proper deliberation. And treading pious tracks he used to govern his\\n subjects very carefully. During his administration earth produced all\\n wished-for objects; roots and fruits were tasteful and flowers were\\n fragrant. Without being cultivated earth used to yield crops. In this\\n wise for many long years he governed a prosperous and wonderful kingdom.\\n Thereupon he determined upon performing a hard penance.

For this, even for your\\n satisfaction, I shall not (myself) slay him. Again I am to afford\\n excellent felicity unto you. I shall myself divide you into three\\n classes and then forsooth your king shall be able to destroy Vitra. Of\\n those three portions the first shall be able to slay him.’ Vishnu, the\\n god of gods, having said this, the deities replied, saying:—’O slayer of\\n demons, undoubtedly what thou hast said, shall prove true; may victory\\n crown thee; we proceed now to slay Vitra. O highly generous deity, do\\n thou now make Vāsava powerly by infusing thy own energy.’ Thereupon the\\n highly powerful immortals headed by Indra entered the forest where the\\n great Asura Vitra was performing austerities. Arriving there they\\n observed that the leading Asura was spreading rays all over—the outcome\\n of his own effulgence, as if devouring the three worlds and burning down\\n the quarters. Beholding that foremost of Asuras, the deities were\\n greatly terrified and began to think of plans by which they would be\\n able to slay him and not be defeated. While they were thus thinking,\\n Indra, of thousand eyes, taking up a thunderbolt, hurled it against\\n Vitra’s head. That dreadful burning thunderbolt, like unto the fire of\\n dissolution, falling on Vitra’s head, the three Worlds were agitated.\\n Thereupon thinking that he has perpetrated an iniquity by slaying Vitra\\n engaged in asceticism, Indra, out of fear, fled to the other side of\\n _Lokaloka_, perpetually enshrowded with darkness. And the sin,\\n consequent upon the destruction of a Brahman, pursuing him vehemently,\\n entered into his person. In this wise Indra became subject to dreadful\\n afflictions. Beholding the enemy slain and Indra fled, the deities\\n headed by fire again and again chanted the glories of Vishnu—the lord of\\n three worlds, saying ’O great god, thou art the refuge of the three\\n worlds. Thou art the first-born and the father of the universe. For\\n protecting all creatures thou hast assumed this Vishnu form. Thou hast\\n slain this Vitra but the sin of slaying a Brahman has visited Indra.\\n Therefore, O excellent Purusha, do thou so arrange that he may be freed\\n from sins.’ Hearing the words of the celestials Vishnu said—’Let your\\n Chief celebrate a sacrifice in my honor—and by that he shall be cleansed\\n of the sin. If the slayer of Pāka celebrates a horse sacrifice, he shall\\n again fearlessly be installed as the chief of deities.’ Having addressed\\n these nectar-like words to the deities and being glorified by them,\\n Vishnu, the god of gods, returned to his abode.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",

Being\\n at his wit’s end he repaired to the other side of the _Lokaloka_\\n mountain and remained there for some time like a coiled serpent. And\\n again in consequence of Indra’s separation, the whole world was\\n agitated, the forests grew dried and the earth was devoid of water. On\\n account of the rivers being dried up and want of rain all creatures grew\\n impatient. In this wise, the time of the destruction of creatures having\\n arrived, the celestials being stricken with anxiety, according to the\\n previous command of Vishnu, engaged in celebrating the sacrifice With\\n Rishis and Ritwikas they fearfully approached Purandara; and beholding\\n him assailed by the sin of Brahmanicide, they with him, at their head,\\n engaged in celebrating a horse-sacrifice. After the sacrifice the sin\\n issued out of Indra’s person and addressing the high-souled deities said\\n ’Do ye all ascertain, where I shall go now.’ Thereupon highly pleased\\n the deities replied:—’Do thou divide thyself into four portions.’\\n Hearing the words of the high-souled celestials she divided herself into\\n four parts, and wishing for a separate habitation said:—’By one portion,\\n I shall at my pleasure, live in rivers full of water during rains and\\n shall obstruct people from going there. By my second portion I shall\\n live perpetually on lands as _Ushara_;⁹⁸ I tell you the truth. By my\\n third portion I shall for three nights every month live in youthful\\n women proud of their youth—so that men might not live with them. And by\\n my fourth portion I shall enter into the persons of those who shall slay\\n innocent Brāhmanas.’ Hearing those words the deities said ’What thou\\n hast said shall be carried out. Do what thou wishest.’ Thereupon the\\n celestials, delighted, adored their Chief divested of sins and crowned\\n with victory. And Vāsava being installed again on the throne, the whole\\n universe was at rest. Thereupon Indra worshipped Vishnu in the shape of\\n that wonderful sacrifice.

O gentle\\n one, I have heard, that formerly in the province of Valheeka, the\\n graceful king Ila, the son of the patriarch Kardama, was highly pious. O\\n foremost of men, having brought the entire earth under his control, the\\n highly illustrious king Ila used to govern his subjects like unto his\\n own sons. O descendant of Raghu, being terrified, the generous deities,\\n the rich Daityas, the highly powerful Nāgas, the irrepressible\\n Rākshasas, Gandharvas and Yakshas used to adore him perpetually. The\\n high-souled Ila being enraged, the three worlds used to be convulsed\\n with terror. And albeit so very powerful the highly illustrious king of\\n Valheeka never swerved from the path of morality nor neglected his\\n deities and rather intelligently used to administer all business. Once\\n on a time in the picturesque season of spring the mighty-armed Ila, with\\n his army and conveyances, entered into a charming forest, and on the\\n pretext of hunting, slew hundreds and thousands of deer. With slaying\\n deer only the high-souled king was not satisfied. He slew millions of\\n diverse other animals. In this way being engaged in hunting the king Ila\\n arrived where Kartikeya was born. At that time, in that hilly fountain\\n there was sporting in the company of his followers, the irrepressible\\n god of gods, the three-eyed deity with the daughter of the Chief of\\n mountains. Being desirous of satisfying the goddess Umā, her lord, whose\\n emblem is bull, was sporting under the guise of a female. In that forest\\n land, all male animals or trees were metamorphosed into the other sex at\\n that time. A-hunting, the king Ila, the son of Kardama, arrived at that\\n place and saw all animals and trees changed into female forms. And\\n immediately the king, and his army were changed into similar forms.\\n Finding himself in that plight the king Ila was greatly sorry, and\\n thinking that the misfortune was owing to the influence of the god of\\n gods—Umā’s lord, he was greatly terrified. Thereupon with his followers\\n and army the king took shelter of the high-souled and red-throated\\n deity. Thereupon the great god, the conferrer of boons, with the\\n goddess, smiling said:—’Rise up, O son of Kardama, O thou of great\\n strength, O gentle one, do thou beg of me any other boon than that of\\n obtaining thy manhood.’ Being thus disappointed by the great deity, the\\n king Ila, metamorposed into a female, became greatly sorry and did not\\n pray for any other boon. Being stricken with great sorrow, the king,\\n with whole heart, saluted the daughter of the mountain-chief and\\n said:—’O goddess, thou art the protectress of all—thou dost confer boons\\n on all; seeing thee doth not become fruitless. Do thou therefore have\\n compassion on me.’ Thereupon, cognizant of that king’s intention, the\\n goddess, with Hara’s consent, said:—’Half of the boon, that thou shalt\\n beg of us both, shall be granted by Mahadeva, and the other half shall\\n be granted by me. Do thou therefore beg of me the half.’ Hearing of that\\n excellent and wondrous boon the king became greatly delighted and\\n said:—’If thou art pleased with me, O goddess, do thou confer upon me\\n this boon, that I may be for one month, a female gifted with wonderful\\n beauty in the three worlds and for another month I may be a male.’\\n Thereupon understanding king’s desire, the beautiful goddess Pārvati,\\n mercifully said:—’The boon, according to thy desire, shall be granted. O\\n king, when thou shalt attain to the male figure, thou shalt not remember\\n anything of thy female form. And when thou shalt assume the charming\\n female figure thou shalt forget everything of thy male state.’ O\\n Lakshmana, by virtue of this boon, the king Ila for one month used to\\n become a man and for the next used to become a female, charming in the\\n three worlds under the name of Ilā.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",

And with folded hands they, requesting\\n the noble king Rāma for further particulars, said:—\"How could the king\\n Ila subject himself to those afflictions in the shape of a female? And\\n how did he use to behave himself in his male form?\" Hearing those words\\n begotten of curiosity, Rāma engaged in relating the whole story as he\\n had heard before, saying:—\"In the first month, assuming his female form\\n having lotus-eyes and charming the three world, he used to sport in the\\n forest abounding in groves, in the company of his companions\\n metamorphosed into the same form. Having sent away all his conveyances\\n he used to sport in the mountain vale. Thus roaming, Ilā one day espied\\n Budha, a bundle of rays, resembling the full moon in a picturesque pond\\n filled with birds at some distance from the mountain. Having compassion\\n for all creatures Budha, at that time, was performing, hard, glorious\\n and wished-for austerities within waters. O son of Raghu, on beholding\\n him Ilā was greatly surprised, and with her female companions began to\\n agitate waters. As soon as Budha saw her he was assailed by the arrows\\n of Cupid. Not being able to control himself he grew impatient within\\n waters and thought “This damsel is far more beautiful even than the\\n celestial girls. I have never seen before a like beauty amongst the\\n celestials, Nāgas, Asuras and Apsarās. If she has not been married\\n before then she is my worthy spouse.\" With this resolution Budha got up\\n from the waters, and repairing to his hermitage, sent for the fair ones.\\n They all saluted him. Thereupon the virtuous-souled Budha accosted them\\n saying:—\"Whose daughter is this graceful girl amongst you and for what\\n she has come here? Do not delay—tell me soon.\" Hearing those sweet words\\n of his, the females said:—\"This fair damsel is our supreme lady. She has\\n no husband. Journeying she has come here with us.\" Hearing those plain\\n words, Budha thought of the learning by which one can perceive\\n everything. And being informed of all regarding the king Ila thereby he\\n said—\"Do ye all live in this mountain being _Kimpurusas_; do ye make\\n your respective habitations here. I shall give you always fruits and\\n roots. O ye females, you shall have all _Kimpurusas_ as your husbands.\"\\n According to the words of Budha they lived in that mountain as\\n _Kimpurusas_. In this wise many _Kimpurusa-Budhas_ were procreated.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 101: '## SECTION CII.\\n \\n \\n Having heard of the origin of _Kimpurushas_, both Bharata and Lakshmana\\n said to Rāma:—\"This is a wonderful story.\" Thereupon the highly\\n illustrious Rāma, the foremost of the pious, again began with the story\\n of Ila, the son of the patriarch. \"Beholding the Kinnaris repairing to a\\n distance, Budha the foremost of ascetics, smiling said, to the beautiful\\n Ilā:—\"O thou of a graceful presence, I am the most favourite son of the\\n moon; O fair one, do thou, with delight, cast looks upon me,\" Hearing\\n the words of the highly effulgent and beautiful Budha in the picturesque\\n forest land divested of men and animals, Ilā said:—\"O gentle one, I am\\n not subject to any body; I surrender myself unto thee out of my own\\n accord. O son of Soma, thou mayst command me whatever thou wishest.\"\\n Hearing those wondrous words, the son of moon, possessed by lust, began\\n to live with her. And living in the company of Ilā, having a graceful\\n countenance, Budha, possessed by desire, spent the entire month of Madhu\\n like a moment. Thereupon after the expiry of a month, the graceful king\\n Ila, son of the pariarch, awoke from sleep and beholding Budha, the son\\n of Soma, engaged in austerities with uplifted hands in the midst of\\n waters, said:—\"O illustrious Sir, with my followers I entered this dense\\n forest—I do not see them now anywhere. Where have they gone?\" Hearing\\n the words of the royal saint, who had lost all recollection, Budha, with\\n sweet words consoled him and said:—\"All thy followers have been\\n destroyed by a downpour of huge rocks; thyself, being afraid of the\\n storm, was also asleep in the hermitage. Thou hast no fear now.\\n Therefore, O hero, being consoled and renouncing all anxiety do thou\\n live here happily living upon fruits and roots.\" Being comforted by\\n those words, the high-minded king Ila, striken with distress in\\n consequence of the destruction of his servants, poorly replied:—\"O\\n Brahman, I shall renounce my own kingdom. Separated from my servants, I\\n shall not be able to live, even for a moment. Do thou give me permission\\n in this. O Brahman, my eldest son, the highly illustrious Sasabindu, the\\n foremost of the pious, shall be the owner of my kingdom. O Brahman,\\n renouncing my servants and wives of the country I shall not be able to\\n wait here. Therefore, O highly effulgent one, do thou not give me such\\n an unpleasant command of remaining here.\" Hearing those wonderful words\\n of the king Ila, Budha consoling him, said:—\"Do thou wait here. Be not\\n aggrieved, O highly powerful son of Kardama. If thou dost live here for\\n a year, I shall render thy well-being.\" Hearing the words of Budha, of\\n unwearied actions, the king Ila desired to live there. Thereupon\\n becoming a man for the next month he began to perform ascetic penances.\\n Thereupon in the ninth month, Ilā, having a beautiful waist, gave birth\\n to a highly effulgent son, under the name of Pururavā, born of the loins\\n of Budha, and equally graceful like him. And she handed over the highly\\n powerful son unto his father Budha.

Being greatly delighted for their arrival they all gave\\n out their individual opinion for bringing about the well-being of the\\n king of Vālhakee. For the welfare of his son, the patriarch Kardama\\n said:—’Hear, O twice-born ones, how the well-being of the king Ila may\\n be secured. For this disease I do not find any other good medicine but\\n Umā’s lord. And save Aswamedha there is no other sacrifice more\\n favourite unto the high-souled deity. Let us all therefore celebrate\\n that hard sacrifice on behalf of this king.’ Thereupon Sambarta’s\\n disciple, the royal saint Marutha, the conqueror of enemies’ cities,\\n collected all articles for the sacrifice. Thereupon in the vicinity of\\n Budha’s hermitage that mighty sacrifice was celebrated. And by that the\\n Great Rudra attained to delight and said to the twice-born ones, in the\\n presence of the king Ila:—’O foremost of twice-born ones, I have been\\n greatly delighted with this sacrifice and your devotion. Tell me now,\\n what I can do for this king of Valheeka.’ Hearing the words of Mahādeva,\\n the Brāhmanas, having propitiated him with great devotion, prayed for\\n Ila’s manhood. Thereupon delighted the highly effulgent Mahādeva, having\\n conferred upon him manhood, disappeared. In this wise the\\n horse-sacrifice being finished and Mahādeva having disappeared, the\\n far-seeing and leading twice-born ones repaired to their respective\\n hermitages. And having placed his eldest son Sasavindu as the king of\\n the country of Vālheeka, the king Ila reared another city in the middle\\n country. In time Ila attained to the excellent Brahmā region and his son\\n Pururāva obtained that Pratishthāna kingdom.

Thereupon having\\n heard that charming song in the company of ascetics and kings the\\n high-minded Rāma repaired to the place of business. He heard the\\n Rāmāyana sung by Kusa and Lava, gifted with musical characteristics,\\n consisting of sections, vowels, and consonant and enchanted in\\n accompaniment with the music of a stringed instrument.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 107: '## SECTION CVIII.\\n \\n \\n Rāma heard that highly sacred theme for many long days in the company of\\n ascetics, kings and Vanaras. And understanding from the story that Kusa\\n and Lava were Jānaki’s sons, Rāma mentioning her name said before the\\n assembly:—\"Send a good emissary unto the illustrious Vālmiki and let him\\n communicate unto the ascetics that if Jānaki is sinless and has lead a\\n pure life in the forest; let her give proof of purity by the great\\n ascetic’s permission. Let the emissaries learn well the intention of the\\n ascetic in this and if Sitā is at heart willing to bring in proofs. To\\n uphold her as well as mine purity, let Maithili, the daughter of Jānaka,\\n swear before the assembly.\" Hearing those wonderful words of Rāma, the\\n emissaries speedily went to Vālmiki and saluting the high-souled\\n (ascetic) burning in his effulgence and of incomparable lustre,\\n communicated unto him, in sweet words all what Rāma had said. Hearing\\n the words of the messengers and understanding Rāma’s intention the\\n ascetic said:—\"What Rāma has said shall be satisfied. May good betide\\n you. Husband is the greatest god for women. So Sitā shall carry out his\\n behests.\" The great ascetic having said this, the highly powerful\\n emissaries, approaching Rāma, communicated unto him what the Muni had\\n said. Hearing the words of the high-souled Vālmiki, Rāma was greatly\\n delighted. Having addressed the assembled Rishis and kings he said:—\"The\\n Rishis with their disciples, and the kings with their followers and all\\n others willing shall see Sitā swear here.\" Hearing the words of the\\n high-souled Rāma, all the high-souled Rishis began to speak of him in\\n high terms and said: \"O foremost of men, such an action becomes thee not\\n any one else.\" Thereupon having settled that Sitā would swear next day,\\n Rāma, the slayer of enemies, dismissed them all. And having made\\n arrangements that Sitā would go through the trial next day, the\\n high-minded, generous king Rāma bade adieu unto all kings and Rishis.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 108: '## SECTION CIX.\\n \\n \\n Next morning Rāma, being present in the sacrificial ground and having\\n sent for the Rishis, Vasishtha, Vamadeva Javali, Kashyapa, Viswamitra,\\n carrying on penances for a long time, Durvasa, Pulastya of hard\\n austerities, Salastri, Vargava, Markandaya living long, the highly\\n illustrious Madgalya, Gargya, Chyavana, Satananda, conversant with\\n religions, effulgent Varadwāyā, Agnis’ son Vasuprava, Nārada, Parvata,\\n the great Gautama and other ascetics of firm vows, assembled with minds\\n possessed by curiosity. The highly powerful Rākshasas and monkeys also\\n came there out of curiosity. Besides thousands and thousands of\\n Kshatryas, Vaisyas, Sudras and Brahmans of firm penances, also hailed\\n there from various parts to witness Sitā’s trial. Having arrived there\\n they all sat down motionless like mountains. Thereupon, Vālmiki, the\\n foremost of ascetics, speedily came there accompanied by Sitā. With her\\n face downwards, folded palms, eyes full of tears and meditating upon\\n Rāma in her mind, Sitā, following the Rishi, came before the assembly.\\n There arose a great uproar of eulogy from the assembly when they saw\\n Sitā following Vālmiki like unto Sruti following Brahmā. Thereupon\\n members, stricken with sorrow, made a tumultuous sound. Amongst the\\n visitors some praised Rāma, some praised Sitā and others eulogised both\\n of them. Thereupon having entered that huge assemblage in company of\\n Sitā, the great ascetic Vālmiki addressed Rāma, saying:—\"O son of\\n Daçaratha, in fear of calumny, thou didst renounce her near my\\n hermitage, albeit Sitā is pure and follows the ways of morality. O Rāma\\n of firm vows, thou art afraid of the censure of the people. Sitā has\\n becoming willing to give testimony (of her purity) for removing the\\n calumny of the public; do thou mercifully give her permission in this. I\\n tell you the truth, O Rāma, that these irrepressible twin brothers are\\n your sons, O descendant of Raghu. I am the tenth son of Pracheta, so,\\n far from speaking untruth it does not even spring up in my mind. I\\n therefore know the truth that these twins are thy sons. I have performed\\n austere penances for many thousand years; I now swear before thee, that\\n if this Maithili is found touched by any sin I shall not reap the fruit\\n of my ascetic observances extending over many thousand years. I have\\n never perpetrated before a crime, either in my mind, body, or speech. If\\n Maithili is found divested of sin I may then partake of the fruits of\\n piety. O descendant of Raghu, finding Sitā pure in mind and five\\n elements of body I took her near the spring in the forest. Besides this\\n Sitā, of pure ways, divested of sins and ever considering her husband as\\n deity, shall give testimony this day. Thou hast been afraid of the\\n public calumny. O son of a king, thy mind being possessed by the fear of\\n public scandal, thou didst renounce this Sitā of a pure character and\\n always regarding her husband as a god; I came to know this by virtue of\\n my discriminative knowledge.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 109: '## SECTION CX.\\n \\n \\n After the great Rishi Vālmiki had said this, Rāma, on beholding the\\n daughter of Janaka resembling a celestial, in the midst of the assembly,\\n with folded hands, said:—\"O great one, thou art conversant with piety.\\n By thy words shorn of sin, I have been convinced that Jānaki is of pure\\n ways. Still, O Brahman, what thou hast commanded shall be carried out;\\n let Sitā produce testimony of the purity of her character. Because\\n Vaidehi formerly underwent a trial in the city of Lanka before the\\n celestials I brought her home. O Brahman, vilification of the people is\\n very powerful. Although I know that Jānaki has not been touched by any\\n sin still I have renounced her. Do thou therefore forgive me. I know\\n that these twin brothers Kusa and Lava are my sons. Yet if Jānaki gives\\n evidence of her own purity before the assembly I shall be greatly\\n satisfied.\" Being apprised of Rāma’s intention as to Sitā’s trial the\\n celestials all came there on the occasion. The Adityas, Vasus, Rudras,\\n Viswadevas, Maruts, Sadhyas, Siddhas, Nagas and Rishis placing Brahmā\\n before them, all came there. And beholding the celestials and Rishis\\n assembled there Rāma again said to Vālmiki:—\"O foremost of Munis, the\\n words of the high-souled Rishis, are divested of sin; therefore on thy\\n words only I shall consider Sitā as having pure ways. Still all have\\n come here being anxious to witness Sitā’s trial. I shall therefore be\\n greatly delighted if Jānaki gives in before them any testimony of her\\n pure character.\" As soon as those words were uttered, sweet, fragrant,\\n cold air, the witness of virtue and vice, blowing mildly, excited the\\n joy of the assembly. People, hailing from various countries, with all\\n attention began to witness this wondrous and unthought of event. In the\\n golden age only the celestial wind used to blow—and it now blew even in\\n the Treta Yuga and forsooth it was a matter of exceeding surprise.\\n Thereupon beholding all people assembled there, Janaka’s daughter,\\n wearing a red cloth, with her face and looks downwards and folded palms\\n said:—\"I have never thought of any other person in my mind but Rāma; by\\n the strength of this virtue let the goddess Vasundharā give me room. I\\n have always with my mind, body and words prayed for Rāma’s well-being\\n and by virtue hereof may the goddess Vasundharā give me room in her\\n womb.\" As soon as Sitā swore in this wise a wonderful incident took\\n place. From inside the earth a celestial and excellent throne rose up.\\n It was carried on head by the Nāgas of unmitigated prowess, having\\n celestial persons and adorned with celestial jewels and ornaments.\\n Having stretched out her arms and taken Maithili, the goddess earth\\n welcomed her and placed her on the throne. And while seated on the\\n throne she was entering the earth, she was covered with the continued\\n showers of celestial flowers. Eulogising her at that time, the\\n celestials said \"Oh! highly praiseworthy is thy conduct, O Sitā.\" Being\\n present in the welkin and beholding Sitā enter into the Earth, the\\n celestials again and again eulogised her in various words. The Rishis,\\n kings and other leading men present in the sacrificial arena repeatedly\\n expressed their surprise. Beholding Sitā’s censure thus removed all\\n animals, animate or inanimate, either on earth or in the sky, were\\n greatly delighted. Some cried aloud in joy, some remained silent, and\\n some motionless espied Rāma or Sitā. In this wise beholding Sitā’s\\n entrance into the Earth the ascetics were greatly delighted. They all\\n attaining to the same state of mind, the whole universe, for a moment,\\n was possessed with the state of equality.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 110: '## SECTION CXI.\\n \\n \\n Sitā having entered Rasātala, all the monkeys and Rishis repeatedly\\n eulogised her before Rāma. Stricken with sorrow and grief and lowering\\n down his head, Rāma, with eyes full of tears, face downwards, and a\\n dejected mind, sat down. And being possessed by grief and anger and\\n shedding tears he wept for some time and then said:—\"My mind is about to\\n be possessed by grief, which I had never experienced before, for in the\\n very presence of mine the graceful Jānaki, like Lakshmi herself, hath\\n disappeared from view. Formerly, in my absence, Jānaki was once carried\\n away into the city of Lankā, on the other side of the great ocean and I\\n brought her back; what wonder it is that I shall get her back from\\n Patāla? O goddess Vasudha, do thou soon bring Sitā in my view, or else,\\n worked up with ire I shall give thee the fruits of thy negligence. Thou\\n art my mother-in-law, since the royal saint Janaka obtained Sitā from\\n thy womb while cultivating thee with plough share. Do thou therefore\\n bring back my Sitā or give me a region of the celestials, I wish to live\\n with Sitā. I am beside myself for her: do thou therefore bring back\\n Sitā. If thou dost not render back Sitā unto me O Vasudha, I shall\\n deluge the earth with waters, having assailed, destroyed and drowned\\n into water thy huge compass with mountains and forests.\" Rāma, having\\n given vent to those accents under the influence of ire, the patriarch\\n Brahmā, with the consent of the celestials, said:—\"O Rāma of firm vows,\\n O slayer of enemies, thou shouldst not grieve thus. Recollect thy former\\n state of Vishnu and the counsels. I would not have reminded thee of this\\n secret but for the present necessity. Do thou now once more remember thy\\n birth from Vishnu. By nature, Sitā is pure, chaste and ever dependent\\n upon thee. And by virtue of her ascetic dependance upon thee she has\\n gone to the region of Nāgas. Thou shalt again meet her in heaven. Hear,\\n what I communicate unto thee before the assembly. Thou shalt be informed\\n of everything by listening to this excellent poem describing thy own\\n actions, O hero. Vālmiki has described herein all miseries and joys thou\\n hast experienced since thy birth and what shall happen in future after\\n Sitā’s entrance into Patala. O Rāma, this first epic poem, Rāmayan, has\\n been composed describing thy works. None but thee is worthy of the fame\\n of this poem. O Rāghava, O highly illustrious one, do thou hear with the\\n Rishis, Uttarakandam, the last portion of this poem. O descendant of\\n Raghu, this is not worthy of being heard by any but those who art the\\n foremost of the royal saints.\" Having said this, the deity Brahmā, the\\n lord of the three worlds, with other deities, repaired to the region of\\n immortals. The high-souled and the highly effulgent ascetics, living in\\n Brahmā’s region, who were present in the assembly, obtaining Brahmā’s\\n permission, waited there, to hear Rāma’s future career in the\\n Uttarakandam. Hearing the words of the great Patriarch instinct with\\n well-being, the highly effulgent Rāma said to Vālmiki:—\"O illustrious\\n sir, the Rishis living in Brahmā’s region have grown desirous of hearing\\n my future history. So let it be taken up next morning.\" Having thus\\n settled and taken with him Kusa and Lava and sent away the assembled\\n people he entered his palace and spent the night mourning for Sitā.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 111: '## SECTION CXII.\\n \\n \\n The night being over and having invited the leading ascetics, Rāma told\\n his sons to sing the poem fearlessly. Thereupon the high-souled Rishis\\n having taken their seats Kusa and Lava began the last portion of the\\n Uttarakāndam. Sitā having entered Patala by the strength of her vow, and\\n the sacrifice having terminated, Rāma grew poorly in spirit. In Jānaki’s\\n absence the whole world appeared to him as blank. Now being overwhelmed\\n with grief he lost all mental peace. Having conferred various gifts upon\\n the kings, Rākshasas, monkeys, and leading Brāhmanas, Rāma sent them\\n away and meditating upon Sitā’s absence entered Ayodhyā. And from the\\n time of Sitā’s entering into Patala he did not take any other spouse.\\n And having made a golden image of Sitā he engaged in the performance of\\n various sacrifices. In this wise for thousand years he celebrated many\\n Horse-sacrifices, many Bajpeyas with profuse gold, Agnisomas, Atirātras,\\n numberless Gomedhas and various other sacrifices, Rāma being engaged in\\n governing the kingdom and performing many pious rites long time passed\\n away. And being under his subjection, bears, monkeys, Rākshasas and\\n kings always afforded delight unto him. On account of showers in proper\\n time there was enough of food in his kingdom. The quarters were pure and\\n delightful. The citizens and villagers were happy and healthy. None met\\n with premature death. In fact, in his regime all calamities were\\n removed. Thereupon after many years, the illustrious Kausalya, Rāma’s\\n mother, surrounded by her sons and grand-sons, breathed her last.\\n Performing many pious observances Kakeyi followed her and obtained peace\\n in the land of immortals. Those noble ladies, being united with the king\\n Daçaratha, in heaven, were greatly delighted and obtained all virtues.\\n Besides, having worshipped the deities and manes on the occasion of his\\n father’s _Srādha_ ceremony the high-souled Rāma distributed many jewels\\n and engaged in the performance of a very difficult sacrifice. In this\\n wise having performed many sacrifices and multiplied pieties he spent\\n many thousand years in happiness.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 112: '## SECTION CXIII.\\n \\n \\n Once on a time Yudhajit, the king of Kekaya, sent unto the high-souled\\n Rāma, Gargya—son of his own preceptor Angeras—a Brāhmin saint of\\n unmitigated prowess; and with him he sent, as tokens of affections,\\n gifts of ten thousand horses, numberless blankets, various jewels,\\n diverse clothes and well washed coverlets. Hearing of the arrival of the\\n great saint Gargya with above valuable presents sent by his material\\n uncle Yudhajit, the intelligent Rāma, with his brothers, proceeded about\\n a Krosa to receive him and adored him particularly likely unto the lord\\n of celestials honoring Vrihaspati. Having thus welcomed that foremost of\\n Rishis and accepted the valuable presents sent by his maternal uncle he\\n asked the ascetic about his welfare in every thing. Thereupon the great\\n Rishi being seated, he said:—\"Thou art the foremost of those skilled in\\n the art of speech like the very preceptor of the celestials. Since thine\\n own self hath come here my uncle must have commissioned thee with a very\\n important message.\" Hearing those words of Rāma the great saint\\n communicated unto him the object of his coming, saying.—\"O thou having\\n long arms, if thou dost like, hear what loving words thy maternal uncle\\n Yudhajit, the foremost of men, has said. The Gandharvas, holding weapons\\n and expert in warfare, guard that beautiful province abounding in fruits\\n and roots on the banks of the river Sindhu. O hero, those Gandharvas are\\n Sailuskā’s sons—highly powerful and three kotis in number. Having\\n hoisted thy flag of victory and conquered that highly picturesque city\\n of Gandharvas do thou include that kingdom within thine well-established\\n territories. None can enter there. O thou having long arms, I do not\\n request thee for any harm of thine. Let that highly charming country be\\n liked by thee.\" Hearing the words of the maternal uncle communicated by\\n the great saint, Rāma, with delight, said:—\"What you have commanded\\n shall be satisfied.\" Saying this he looked towards Bharta and\\n delightedly and with folded hands said to the Rishi \"O Brahmarshi, these\\n two princes are Bharata’s sons and their names are Taksha and Pushkala.\\n Being well protected by uncle Yudhajit and preceded by Bharata with army\\n and followers they shall subjugate the Gandharvas and divide the kingdom\\n between them. Having established two kingdoms and installed his two sons\\n there Bharata, the foremost of the pious, shall come back to me.\"\\n \\n Having thus said to the Brahmarshi, Rāma commanded Bharata and welcomed\\n the two princes. Thereupon under the auspices of favourable stars,\\n having placed Gargya before them, Bharata with the princes and army,\\n issued out of the city of Ayodhyā. And Rāma’s army unconquerable even by\\n the celestials went on for a month, from the city like a celestial host\\n under the command of Indra. Animals, living upon flesh and huge-bodied\\n Rākshasas longing for blood followed Bharata. Besides many thousand\\n birds, moving in the sky, lions, tigers and boars went before the army.\\n The army, consisting of delighted and healthy subjects spending half a\\n month in the way, arrived at the Kekaya kingdom in good health.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 113: '## SECTION ICXIV.\\n \\n \\n Hearing of the arrival of the Bharata with the army Gargya and Yudhajit,\\n the king of Kekayas, were greatly delighted. And with a huge army they\\n speedily went out for conquering the Gandharvas. Thereupon the highly\\n powerful and light-armed Bharata and Yudhajit, with the soldiers and\\n followers, arrived at the city of Gandharvas. Having heard of the coming\\n of Bharata the highly powerful Gandharvas gathered round and sent up\\n leonine roars. Thereupon began the battle capable of making down erect\\n and continued for a week. On neither side there was victory or defeat.\\n On all sides there flowed streams of blood and there were afloat human\\n bodies. Daggers, Saktis and bows were like the banks of the river.\\n Thereupon enraged Bharata, Rāma’s younger brother, discharged a dreadful\\n arrow named Sangharata resembling the fire of dissolution against\\n Gandharvas. Having bound them all with the noose of death and sundered\\n them with Sangharata, Bharata despatched all the Gandharvas to the abode\\n of death. Even the celestials could not recollect if such a dreadful\\n encounter had happened before. In a moment the huge Gandharva host was\\n slain. After the destruction of the Gandharvas, Kaikeyi’s son Bharata\\n set up two excellent and prosperous cities in the province of Gandharva.\\n And he placed Taksha in Takshasila and Pushkala in Pushkalabati. Both\\n the cities were filled with profuse riches and jewels and covered with\\n various gardens. As for many ornaments both of them as if vied with one\\n another. By just purchases and sales, and by the conduct of the people\\n the cities grew highly charming. Both of them were filled with gardens\\n and conveyances. Rows of shops were well arranged by the streets in both\\n the cities. Both of them were adorned with many excellent fancy\\n articles, picturesque houses, charming palaces and many beautiful and\\n high Tāla, Tamāla, Tilaka and Vakula trees. Having reared up those two\\n cities within five years, Rāma’s younger brother, the mighty armed\\n Bharata, son of Kaikeyi, returned to Ayodhyā. And like unto Vāsava\\n saluting Brahmā he adored the high-souled Rāghava the very personation\\n of virtue and communicated unto him duly the destruction of the\\n Gandharvas and the establishment of the two cities.

And then Rāma said to Lakshmana:—\"O Saumitri, thy two\\n sons, Angada and Chandraketu are well-versed in religions, perfectly\\n qualified in governing the kingdom and highly powerful. I shall\\n therefore install them on throne. O gentle one, do thou find out such a\\n country where these two skillful archers may unobstructed roam about.\\n And where if a kingdom is established it might not disturb the peace and\\n happiness of other kings.\" Rāma, having finished his speech Bharata\\n replied:—\"The country of Karupada is highly picturesque and freed from\\n all thorns. Let the city for Angada be established there. And let the\\n beautiful country of Chandradyuti be the kingdom of Chandraketu.\" Rāma\\n approved of the words of Bharata and having brought the country of\\n Karupada under his subjection gave it to Angada. He reared a beautiful\\n and well-protected city for Angada. And in the country of Mallya he\\n reared a city for Chandraketu, named Chandrakānti highly picturesque and\\n like unto the city of celestials. Thereupon greatly delighted Rāma,\\n irrepressible in battle, Lakshmana and Bharata, having performed the\\n ceremony of installation ordered them to go their respective cities.\\n Angada started towards the West and Chandraketu towards the North.\\n Sumitra’s son Lakshmana went with Angada and Bharata accompanied\\n Chandraketu.

And\\n Bharata, according to his desire, having spent more than a year in the\\n city of Chandrakānti, came back to Ayodhyā and saluted Rāma’s feet. The\\n pious Lakshmana and Bharata—both the brothers, were greatly attached\\n unto Rāma; and though they spent their days in another place they did\\n not experience any pain in consequence of separation from their sons.\\n Observing all virtues in this way, Rāma, the foremost of the pious,\\n Bharata and Lakshmana governed the subjects for ten thousand years.\\n Having spent their days in the city of Ayodhyā, the very city of virtue,\\n the three brothers, appearing graceful like the burning fire receiving\\n oblations in a great sacrifice, attained to joy in the fullness of time.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",

Lord\\n Brahmā, the father of all creatures, has said that thou didst promise to\\n preserve the three worlds. Formerly when having slain all animals by thy\\n Māyā thou wert asleep in the waters of the mighty deep I was born.\\n Thereafter thou didst create the huge-bodied Ananta, living in the\\n waters as the king of serpents. Then thou didst create two highly\\n powerful Asuras named Madhu and Kaithabha. At that time the bones of\\n those two Asuras having been scattered far and wide this earth\\n containing many mountains was named _Medini_. Having procreated me in\\n thy lotus navel, dazzling in celestial brilliance thou didst employ me\\n in the work of generation. I took the charge and procreated men; but\\n finding no other means to preserve them I worshipped thee, the lord of\\n the universe and said:—O lord, thou shouldst protect the creatures, for\\n thou art my father and giver of energy and therefore irrepressible.\\n Thereupon for concerting means for the preservation of creatures, thou\\n didst renounce thy irrepressible shape and assume Vishnu form. And\\n taking thy birth from Aditi’s powerful son, thou wert engaged in\\n enhancing the delight of my brothers. Thou didst use to protect the\\n deities whenever they were assailed by any calamity. O lord of the\\n universe, it is for that reason, on beholding the destruction of\\n creatures thou wert born on earth to slay the Ten-necked demon. And at\\n that time thou didst promise that thou wouldst live in the land of\\n mortals for eleven thousand years. Thereupon thou didst assume a human\\n form to carry out thine desire. Now that period is ripe and this is the\\n proper time to inform thee of it. O great king, do thou wait in this\\n land of mortals if dost thou wish to govern people for some time more.\\n And if dost thou wish to repair to the region of immortals, do thou\\n again lord over the deities in thy Vishnu form and let them be freed\\n from anxiety. O Hero, the Patriarch hath sent this intelligence unto\\n thee.\" Hearing those unequalled words of the Patriarch from the mouth of\\n Kāla, the destroyer of all, Rāma smiling said:—\"I have been greatly\\n pleased and happy for thy coming here, O my son.

Thereupon\\n remembering the words of Kāla, Rāma was greatly sorry. And thinking of\\n those dreadful words he was overwhelmed with grief. And with a poorly\\n heart, and face downwards he remained silent for some time. Thereupon\\n thinking of Kāla’s words and determining that every calamity would\\n befall him, that highly illustrious descendant, of Raghus, summoned\\n patience.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 118: '## SECTION CXIX.\\n \\n \\n Thereupon beholding Rāma with his head downwards and poorly like unto\\n the moon possessed by Rāhu, Lakshmana, delightedly and with sweet words,\\n said:—\"Be not aggrieved for me, O thou having mighty arms. Such is the\\n course of time; the movements of creatures are destined by their\\n pristine actions, good or bad. O gentle one, do thou satisfy thy promise\\n slaying me without any hesitation. O Kākuthstha, those, who cannot carry\\n out their promises, repair to hell. O great king, if thou hast any love\\n or affection for me, do thou satisfy thy promise by fearlessly slaying\\n me.\" Hearing those words of Lakshmana Rāma’s mind was greatly moved.\\n Thereupon having invited his priests and ministers there he communicated\\n unto them his promise and Durvāsā’s arrival. Hearing it the ministers\\n and priests remained silent. Thereupon Vasishtha, of unmitigated\\n effulgence, said:—\"O highly illustrious and mighty armed Rāma, I knew\\n before by virtue of my asceticism, of this thy present destruction and\\n separation from Lakshmana. Time is powerful; do not falsify thy promise.\\n Promises not carried out bring on the destruction of virtue. And on the\\n wane of virtue, forsooth, the three worlds, with celestials, saints,\\n mobile and immobile creations, shall be destroyed. Therefore, O foremost\\n of men, do thou protect, the universe by suffering separation from\\n Lakshmana, in the interest of the preservation of the three worlds.\" All\\n other ministers and priests agreed with Vasishtha’s words. Thereupon\\n hearing their moral counsels, Rāma said to Lakshmana before the\\n assembly:—\"O Lakshmana, it is not proper to act against morality, I do\\n therefore renounce thee; for the pious hold that destruction and\\n renounciation are all the same.\" Rāma saying this, Lakshmana did not go\\n to his own house, but with eyes full of tears specially repaired\\n therefrom. Having reached the banks of Saraju and rinsed his mouth he\\n stood there with folded palms. And having obstructed all passages he did\\n not breathe any more. Lakshmana, the younger brother of Rāma, being thus\\n engaged in penances, having obstructed his breath, Apsarās, Indra and\\n other deities and Rishis showered flowers on him. Thereupon beyond the\\n sight of men, having taken the highly powerful Lakshmana within his\\n body, the king of celestials entered his own city. Thereupon beholding\\n Lakshmana, the fourth portion of Vishnu arrived at their city the\\n celestials were greatly delighted and engaged in his worship.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 119: '## SECTION CXX.\\n \\n \\n Having forsaken Lakshmana and being stricken with sorrow and grief Rāma\\n said to his citizens and ministers:—\"Having placed the pious and heroic\\n Bharata on the throne of Ayodhyā, I shall to-day repair to woods. Do ye,\\n without any delay collect there all articles of installation. I shall\\n follow the way which has been wended by Lakshmana.\" Hearing the words of\\n Rāghava, the subjects with their heads downwards remained motionless\\n like so many dead bodies. Hearing Rāma’s words Bharata was also\\n stupified and speaking ill of the kingdom, said:—\"O King, I swear by\\n truth, that far from kingdom I do not wish to live in heaven even\\n without thee: O King, of these two princes, Kusi and Lava do thou place\\n Kusi in Kosala and Lava in North Kosala. And let quick-moving emissaries\\n go to Satrughna and communicate unto him the intelligence of our going\\n there.\" Hearing those words of Bharata and beholding the subjects\\n stricken with sorrow having their heads downwards, Vasishtha\\n said:—\"Behold, O Rāma, the subjects have placed themselves on the\\n ground. Do thou, therefore; apprised of their intention, satisfy their\\n desire.\" Raising up the subjects according to the words of Vasishtha\\n Rāma said:—\"What good can I do for you!\" Hearing Rāma’s words they\\n said:—\"O King, we shall follow thee wherever thou shalt go. If thou hast\\n any love or affection for the citizens do thou permit them that they may\\n follow thy good path with their wives and children. O lord, if thou dost\\n not forsake us, let us all go wherever thou wilt,—be it a forest, an\\n intractable tract, a river or an ocean. O great king, by this we shall\\n be greatly delighted. We pray for this boon only. Our delight consists\\n in following thee in everything.\" Observing such a firm devotion of the\\n citizens Rāma agreed to that. Thereupon having gone through his duties\\n he installed Kusi in the kingdom of Kosala and Lava in the northern\\n country. Having thus installed the high-souled and heroic Kusi and Lava\\n and conferred upon each of them thousand chariots, Ajuta Nāgas, Ajuta\\n horses and various jewels and riches he established them in their\\n respective kingdoms. Having thus settled the princes he despatched an\\n emissary to Satrughna.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 120: '## SECTION CXXI.\\n \\n \\n Having been despatched by Rāma, quick-moving emissaries speedily arrived\\n at Mathura. Continually travelling for three nights and days, they\\n arrived there and communicated unto Satrughna the intelligence. Having\\n informed him of the renouncing of Lakshmana, Rāma’s promise and the\\n following of the citizens they said:—\"The intelligent Rāma has reared\\n for Kusi the spacious city of Kusavati at the foot of the Vindhya range.\\n The city of Sravanti has been reared for Lava, and the mighty\\n car-warriors Rāma and Bharata, making Ayodhyā void of men, have\\n addressed themselves for repairing to heaven.\" Having speedily\\n communicated unto him this intelligence the emissaries took rest.\\n Thereupon they asked Satrughna to proceed soon. Observing the dreadful\\n destruction of his race, Satrughna sent for his subjects and priests and\\n informed them of everything. He also communicated unto them his own\\n destruction with his brothers. Thereupon the king Satrughna determined\\n upon installing his two sons in the kingdom. Suvahu was placed on the\\n throne of Mathura and Satrughati became the king of Vidisha. Having thus\\n established Suvahu in Mathura, and Satrughati in Vidisha, the great hero\\n Satrughna ascended his car and went to Ayodhyā. And there he saw the\\n great Rāma, clothed in silk raiment burning like fire in the midst of\\n the ascetics. Thereupon remembering his duty he saluted Rāma, conversant\\n with piety and with folded hands said:—\"I have placed my two sons on the\\n throne of my kingdom. I have now resolved upon following thee, O King. O\\n hero, do not command me otherwise. I pray only that I may not neglect\\n thy command.\" Thereupon understanding the firm resolution of Satrughna,\\n the descendant of Raghu agreed. Immediately after Rāma had said this,\\n monkeys assuming shapes at will, bears, and Rakshas began to assemble\\n there. Apprised of Rāma’s determination of going to heaven, monkeys,\\n born of the celestials, Rishis and Gandharvas taking Sugriva before\\n them, came there to see Rāma. And they all said:—\"O Rāma, O foremost of\\n men, if thou dost repair to heaven forsaking us all, it will be hurling\\n Yama’s rod upon us.\" The highly powerful Sugriva too saluting Rāma\\n said:—\"O lord of men, having placed Angada on the throne I have come\\n hither. I have determined upon following thee, O King.\" Hearing the\\n words of monkeys, Rāma said that their desire would be fulfilled. He\\n then said to Bibhishana the king of Rākshasas:—\"As long as people shall\\n breathe, O Bibhishana, O highly powerful lord of Rākshasas, thou shalt\\n preserve thy body in Lankā. As long as the moon, the sun and the earth\\n shall exist and as long as my story shall remain current, thy kingdom\\n shall be in existence. Thou didst, out of friendship, carry out my\\n behests and perform my works. Do thou piously govern thy subjects. I\\n should not speak any thing else. What shall I say more unto thee, O\\n highly powerful lord of Rākshasas. Worship Jagannath (the lord of the\\n world), the presiding deity of the Ikshwāku race.\" Having thus addressed\\n the king of Rākshasas always obeying Rāghava’s command, Kākuthstha said\\n to Hanumān:—\"It is settled that thou shalt live forever, do thou, now\\n observe thy promise. As long as my history shall run current in this\\n world do thou at my command live happily.\" Being thus addressed by the\\n high-souled Rāghava Hanumān attained to great delight and said:—\"As long\\n as the sacred theme shall pass current in this world I shall live here\\n carrying out thy commands.\" Thereupon he said to the Jambhuvan, Brahmā’s\\n son, Mainda, Dwivida and five others in his company:—\"As long as the\\n Kali Yuga exists do ye all live.\" Having thus addressed them all\\n Kākuthstha said to bears and monkeys, \"Do ye come all with me.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 121: '## SECTION CXXII.\\n \\n \\n After the night had expired the highly illustrious Rāma having a\\n spacious breast and eyes like lotus petals said to the priest:—\"Let the\\n brilliant umbrellas Agnihotra, and Bājapeya go with the Brāhmanas\\n before, which look well in the great road.\" Thereupon the highly\\n effulgent Vasishtha arranged duly all the ceremonies necessary for going\\n to the next world. Thereupon wearing a thin cloth, holding kusa grass by\\n his fingers, and reciting Vedic hymns he proceeded to the banks of\\n Saraju. Having given up all actions of senses, and suffered the pains of\\n going on foot he issued out of the city speechless like unto the burning\\n sun. On his right hand side was the lotus-handed Sree, on his left hand\\n side was the goddess Earth and before him was the power of destruction.\\n Various arrows, huge bows, and daggers, assuming forms followed him. And\\n also went with him the four Vedas in the shape of the Brāhmanas, the all\\n protecting Gayatri, Omkāra and Vasatkāra. The high-souled Rishis and\\n great Asuras followed the high-souled Rāma to the open gates of heaven.\\n All the female servants, old and young, the damsels of the seraglio\\n accompanied by servants having no manhood, Bharata and Lakshmana\\n accompanied by their wives, followed him with Agnihotra. All those\\n high-souled ones, assembled there with Agnihotra and followed Kākuthstha\\n with their wives and children. The ministers and the servants, with\\n their sons, beasts and friends, followed Rāma delightedly. Thereupon all\\n the subjects healthy and delighted went after Rāghava, attracted by his\\n accomplishments and cleansed of their sins. All the females and males,\\n with their beasts, birds and friends, delightedly followed Rāghava.\\n Bathed and delighted, all the monkeys, healthy and joyous following\\n Rāma, created a continued tumult. There was none poorly, aggrieved or\\n miserable—all of them appeared wonderfully happy and delighted. When\\n Rāma issued out of the city, whoever came to see him followed him being\\n desirous of going to heaven. Bears, monkeys and Rākshasas and all the\\n citizens followed him with great devotion and collected minds. And all\\n other animals, that were beyond the view of all in the city went after\\n Rāghava proceeding to heaven. All creations mobile and immobile, whoever\\n beheld Kākuthstha followed him. All beings in Ayodhyā, whoever breathe\\n and are very minute, accompanied Rāma.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
       " 122: '## SECTION CXXIII.\\n \\n \\n Having thus gone for more than a half Yojana, the descendant of Raghu\\n espied Saraju of holy waters flowing towards the west. And having\\n crossed that river of rising waves to some extent, Rāma, with his\\n followers arrived at the place where he should give up his person.\\n Thereupon at that moment, Brahmā, the grandfather of all encircled by\\n all high-souled deities and with hundred kotis of celestial cars,\\n arrived there where Kākuthstha had addressed himself to repair to\\n heaven. The aerial way was full of lustre but its brilliance was\\n increased the more by the native effulgence of the inhabitants of\\n heavens, always performing pious actions. There blew the holy, fragrant\\n and delightful winds and there fell profusely celestial flowers from the\\n hands of the deities. The place was filled with the noise of hundreds of\\n bugles sounded by Gandharvas and Apsarās. And then Rāma prepared himself\\n to descend to the waters of Saraju. Thereupon the Patriarch gave vent to\\n the following accents from the welkin:—“Come O Vishnu; may good betide\\n thee; by our good fortune thou art coming here; O Rāghava hear—O thou\\n having mighty arms, do thou enter here with thy brothers, resembling the\\n celestials in brilliance in whatever form thou likest—either in that of\\n the sky or in thy own Vishnu form. Thou art the refuge of the\\n creatures—nobody knoweth thee. Thou art above the range of thought;\\n great immortal and imperishable; nobody knoweth thee save Māyā, having\\n wide eyes, thy former spouse. Do thou enter here thyself in whatever\\n effulgent form thou likest.” Hearing the words of the Patriarch and\\n determining everything the high-minded Rāma entered there bodily with\\n his brothers in his Vishnu form. Thereupon all the celestials Sādhyas\\n Marutas, headed by Indra and Agni worshipped that deity, Vishnu. So did\\n all the celestial Rishis, Gandharvas, Apsarās, Suparnas, Nāgas, Yakhas,\\n demons, Dānavas and Rākshasas. Thereupon eulogising him the celestials\\n said:—\"Our region is now freed from sins and all here have been\\n delighted and all their desires have been fulfilled.\" Thereupon the\\n highly effulgent Vishnu said to the Patriarch Brahmā:—\"It behoveth thee,\\n O thou of good vows, to allot to those people their proper regions.\\n These illustrious ones have followed me out of love. They are worthy of\\n my respect for they are my devotees and have renounced their persons for\\n me.\" Hearing the words of Vishnu, the lord Brahmā, father of all\\n creatures, said:—\"All these people who have come here shall go to the\\n region named Santanaka. This region is intended even for him, who though\\n born in the most degraded state, thinks of all objects as Vishnu. There\\n is no question about their attaining to this region who, out of\\n devotion, have followed thee and renounced their persons. This region\\n has all the attributes of the Brahmā region and is next to it. The\\n monkeys and bears shall enter into their respective celestial forms.\\n They shall enter into the deities from whom they had respectively\\n originated. Sugriva shall enter into the Sun’s region. And they shall\\n obtain their respective fathers’ forms among the celestials present.\"\\n The lord of the deities having said this, all those who were present at\\n the holy pilgrimage of _Gopratra_ descended into the waters of Saraju\\n with eyes full of tears of joy. Having bathed there, given up their\\n lives delightedly and renounced their human forms they ascended the\\n celestial cars. And having obtained the waters of Saraju, hundreds of\\n those that were born in the race of birds attained to the land of\\n immortals obtaining the respective celestial forms (they had before).\\n And in those celestial forms, they looked effulgent like the deities.\\n And going to the waters of Saraju all objects, mobile and immobile,\\n having bathed there, repaired to the excellent celestial region. Having\\n renounced their bodies in the water thereof all the bears, monkeys, and\\n Rakshasas attained to the land of deities. Having thus settled in heaven\\n all those arrived there the father, of creatures with the deities,\\n delighted and happy, repaired to the highest heaven.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n'}"
