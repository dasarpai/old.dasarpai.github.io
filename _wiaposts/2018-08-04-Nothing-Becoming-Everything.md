# Nothing Becoming Everything
    
Objects live in the space and     
they need some 3D space in the space     
where an object can fit into.    
    
Minimum space required to place     
One liter of water is .001 cubic meter.     
What is that minimum space     
in which nothing can be placed,     
even a subatomic particle cannot be placed?    
    
10^-105 cubic meter is that space     
in which nothing can live inside.     
Even light or any kind of radiation     
cannot enter in that volume     
because the thickness of light or radiation is too much.    
    
But, if you have 10^103 units of     
that smallest space then the final made-up space     
can hold one liter of water in that space.    
    
Space which cannot hold anything, even not light rays,     
starts holding everything     
even house, city, planet, star, and galaxies.    
    
This is how nothing becomes everything.     
But is that space really nothing?     
Just because we can not put     
anything physical in that smallest space     
it doesnâ€™t become zero or nothing.     
It is near to zero but not zero.    
    
In fact there is nothing zero in the entire existence.     
Either in the matter form or in the energy form     
they may exist with least quantity but they exist.     
Even if something exists in your idea     
it means it exists in the energy form.    
    
With our all physical or technical capability     
if we can measure then     
we never say it is zero or infinite.     
When we fail to count due to limitation then     
only we call it zero or infinite.    
    
Thus zero and Infinity both are concepts     
but in reality, they do not exist.    
    
Any guess who brought these two ideas     
of the two non-existences?
