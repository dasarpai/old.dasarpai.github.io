# Which Metrics Does Really Matter?
    
Whether our general knowledge     
or our value system     
What we want to know or value looks something like this.    
    
Who is the richest person in the city, country, world?     
Who is the most influential person in the city, country, world?     
Who is holding a particular position in the organization, city, country, world?     
Which is the Highest GDP country or state?     
Which state has the Highest literacy?     
Which state has the highest level of education?     
This way there are hundreds of metrics     
Which are in place and we need     
to mug-up them to look smart!    
    
These are the metrics that are easy to count     
Because lots of data is there     
Commonly agreed formulas are there in place.    
    
But tell me, in the life of an individual or common citizen     
what is the use of learning this kind of metrics?    
    
There is a tool called media analytics     
There are people who get benefited     
either by earning after doing so     
or getting a name when this is done.    
    
But we common citizens, reader     
What we get out of it?     
Except a desire to be something else.     
Sometimes in ugly form, this is called motivation for others     
Why I am saying ugly because you try to copy someone     
and then end up saying its not my cup of tea     
that person is really great     
I am nothing before him.     
Or we say without being corrupt     
you cannot be successful like him.     
I am not like that.    
    
In this spirit, we forget to understand that     
With a hammer, you cannot stitch cloths     
It doesn’t mean hammer is bad     
It only means it is being used for the wrong purpose     
Every individual need to discover their own path     
And travel that without copying     
even closest person in your field of work    
    
Why don’t we create metrics which matters for all     
By following which there is no such kind of stress among human     
By achieving those metrics     
people are able to relate better with others and live happily    
    
We should create metrics     
To measures those characteristics of human,     
And rewards the individuals for achieving those metrics.     
Some metrics are like below    
    
A person of the highest integrity.     
A most peaceful selfless hardworking citizen.     
A person with least or zero bank balance but huge impact creator.     
A most loving person who can speak the truth on the face without fear.     
A person who spends the most time with the unprivileged.     
A person who created technology that improved the lives of millions of poor.     
A person who inspired thousands of children to come of depression     
and helped them to follow their own life and passion    
    
The issues with this kind of award are     
It is not easy to measure the said behavior     
But we know, it matters a lot to all     
The lazy human mind always jumps for low hanging fruits     
Highest return on the lowest investment     
And this applies to the domain of rewards and recognition as well    
    
Tell me what will I get     
If I remember the name of all influential,     
rich and powerful people of this world?     
Still, my struggle to earn my next bread is the same.     
What are the **important metrics** of life    
    
Someone said it inspires him!     
Ask yourself, it really inspires or creates a vacuum,     
which is later filled by undesirable emotions of a human?    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Your Truly Hari
