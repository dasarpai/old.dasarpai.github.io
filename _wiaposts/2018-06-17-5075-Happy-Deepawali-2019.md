# Happy Deepawali 2019   
## Happy Diwali  
     
Before we emerge ourselves     
in the long celebrations of Deepawali,     
I wanted to share with you one thought.    
    
At every moment of this festival     
we know that today our Rama     
has come back from the forest.     
But, why did Rama went to the forest?     
What great he did there?     
Who went out from Ayodhya and     
who came to Ayodhya are they both the same?     
If not then what was the transformation?    
    
Is Rama like a Bollywood film hero,     
which remind us always happy ending or     
Rama is much deeper than heroism,     
winning and a happy ending?    
    
Do we celebrate Deepawali just because     
we are Sanatani (Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain) and     
Rama was our ancestor or     
there is some more reason for that?    
    
Perhaps Rama of Ayodhya has come back,     
and Bharat and Ayodhya have many reasons to celebrate.     
But see around in evening parties of Deepawali     
who is celebrating Rama’s return and     
how they celebrate that.    
    
Hope Ravana has not compromised     
the occasion and celebrating in an unethical way.     
The day Osama Bin Laden celebrates American independence day     
don’t think it is a good sign for the USA.     
Be watchful in your breath about the celebrator     
and the reason for the celebration.    
    
Finally, my Rama has come back     
but the Rama, which was in me     
is still wandering in the forest,     
when will he come back,     
for what He is waiting?     
On this auspicious occasion     
can you please pray for the return of Rama in me?    
    
I pray that your Rama returns back     
in your heart and mind.    
    
Wish you a very happy and lovely     
Dhanteras, Deepawali, Bhaidooj, Goverdhan Pooja    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Yours Truly Hari
