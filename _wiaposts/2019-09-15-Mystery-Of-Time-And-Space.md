# Mystery Of Time And Space   
    
Let us look into time first.    
One minute is made of 60 seconds    
One second is made of 1000 milliseconds.    
One millisecond is made of 1000 microseconds.    
What is the smallest unit of time is made of?    
The “present” time is only that.    
    
By the time you blink eyes    
the present becomes past.    
The “present” is so small that    
we even do not know how small is that.    
This is the reason either it is    
One microsecond or one minute or    
one hour or one day or one year old, all are past.    
    
All units of time either minute or second or microsecond    
Can measure only “past” time or “future” time    
You measure only that which is passed or    
when it is about to pass    
There is no way to measure the present    
There is no watch which shows the “present” time    
because “present” is so small.    
    
Let’s say you have a watch which can    
measure microsecond on some wall    
A watch is showing the tick of the "time passed"    
You even cannot count that    
because “present” is so small.    
    
For some creatures, one second is too long    
For other creatures, 10 years is too short    
In human experience, if 20 static frame moves before us    
in one second then we call it is moving,    
and we get an illusion of a movie.    
20 frames a one seconds means    
One frame in 50 milliseconds    
There are many lives which have a total life of only 50 ms.    
For human it is just one frame    
and some life have lived their life fully.    
    
What is that from which “present” takes birth?    
Is the time only human and mental creation?    
Is time an unreal thing but    
serve the real purpose of coordination with surrounding?    
If it is so then billions of watches on this planet are    
measuring something which only exists in the mind.    
It has no physical existence    
and it is definitely not showing the “present” time.    
    
For scientists, time is scalar and vector both    
Because it moves in some direction so it is a vector.    
But we know this move only in forward direction and    
this forwardness is so implicit that    
we even don’t bother about this aspect    
and we measure only the duration that is why it is scalar.    
They use a watch to measure the duration and    
for doing that they do the round off of time    
either in minutes or seconds or anything    
whatever serves their purpose.    
    
Now let us look space.    
We know a living body is made of proteins,    
Proteins are made of molecules,    
Molecules are made of atoms,    
Atoms are made of subatomic particles,    
Subatomic particles are made of quarks,    
Quarks are vibrations of    
something “unknown” in the field.    
    
What is the that “unknown” of which quark is made of?    
What is that “field” made of in which    
“unknown” vibrates and gives rise to quark,    
subatomic particles, atoms, molecules, proteins,    
bodies and phenomenon world around?    
    
Science is still struggling to know the answer to this    
But, religious people say their god and messenger    
have told everything in their holy book.    
Meditators get lost in that timeless and spaceless    
existence and come fresh to live again.    
    
O Chaitanya, are you a struggling scientist    
or a religious person who knows everything    
or a child like me who know nothing    
about this phenomenal world around    
and puzzled all the time    
That how things happened and    
how it is happening and    
what is the meaning of happening?
