# Is Argument Bad?

An **argument** is a structured series of    
sentences, statements, or propositions,    
where some serve as **premises** leading to a **conclusion**.    
This logical framework is not just confined    
to philosophy or debate but is also fundamental to both    
**scientific inquiry** and **spiritual exploration**.     
   
In the scientific process, an argument begins with a **hypothesis**—   
a proposed explanation or assumption about reality.    
To test its validity, we put forward **statements and reasoning**,    
conduct **experiments**, gather **data**,    
and engage in **analysis**.    
The argument is then refined through **discussion and debate**,    
ensuring that the conclusion is    
backed by empirical or logical support.     
   
**Discussion**, on the other hand, is different.    
It occurs when there is already an established    
understanding of a subject.    
There is no **hypothesis to test** and    
no **argument to build**—only an exchange of    
knowledge, clarification, or elaboration.     
   
In Indian Hindu tradition, if we ask ourself   
What Adishankara was doing when he was traveling    
across the length and width of Bharat?   
Was he is discussing with other Mathas,    
Schools of thoughts and Acharyas?   
No, he was doing Purva Paksha of every school of thoughts    
Then engaging with them with his answers.   
There was hypothesis, there were arguments and    
there were conclusions of those arguments.   
   
Unfortunately, in society, the idea of "argument"    
has been misunderstood and often carries a negative connotation.    
Many people engage in **verbal fights**    
rather than true arguments    
because they lack a **clear hypothesis**    
or a logical basis for discussion.    
Instead of systematically seeking the truth,    
they argue emotionally, leading to    
**pointless disputes** that go in circles.    
This is not argumentation—it is **chaos**.     
   
However, **arguments between serious    
and intellectual individuals**    
who are genuinely seeking the truth are beneficial.    
They refine perspectives, challenge assumptions,    
and lead to deeper understanding.    
   
When **fools argue**, however,    
they have nothing to establish except    
their own **stubbornness, emotional outbursts,    
and sometimes even physical aggression**.    
Instead of engaging in meaningful debate,    
they resort to **madness and violence**,    
making the entire exchange **ugly and unproductive**.     
   
True argumentation is a tool for discovery,    
reasoning, and progress.    
But for it to be fruitful,    
it requires **clarity, rationality, and an openness to the truth**—   
not just the desire to win at any cost.
