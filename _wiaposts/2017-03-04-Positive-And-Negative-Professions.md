# Positive And Negative Professions
       
There is a city, every road in this city     
Has potholes and it is causing     
Lots of accidents, court case, and pain     
among civilians.    
    
And to fix this problem     
Intellectuals are debating     
that city needs to have     
more hospitals, more emergency wards,     
more doctors, more medicines     
more nurses, more advocate,     
more police force on the roads,     
more jails, more human right activist, etc.     
It means this entire economy is based on negative professions.    
    
Rather than fixing roads     
citizens are debating     
in favor of growing these professions,     
employment growth, increasing GDPS     
(gross domestic product and services)     
It means intellectuals of the city     
Wish to build and grow the economy     
of the city based on the miseries and pain     
of the city dwellers.    
    
If a village has more agricultural products,     
more opportunities to learn dance,     
sing, paint, draw, play, research,     
more beautiful living space for dwellers,     
more community activities,     
more opportunities to enjoy     
and celebrate festivals,     
more pot makers, jewelry designers.     
Equal opportunity for all,     
trust between dwellers,     
more schools and teachers to learn,     
no flexing muscle between people,     
love and respect for each other.     
Then this village is built on     
the happiness and joy of its dweller.    
    
If people learn to live sensibly     
in terms of eating, drinking,     
financial transactions and respect for others     
then why those professionals are required     
who are trying to fix the problems?    
    
If our focus is to fix the problem then     
we need professional of certain types.    
    
if our focus is to build a society     
In such a way that people live     
in a sensible way then more professionals     
of other types are required.    
    
Fortunately, the human mind is     
driven by greed, anger, lust, desire     
Therefore it is never possible     
for all human beings to live sensibly all the time.     
Hence all kinds of professionals are in demand.    
    
But we need to understand     
if there are more people     
with negative profession     
in the city or village     
Then this is one way of living.    
    
And if there are more people of     
the positive profession in the city or village     
then that is another way of living.    
    
Below is a list of professions     
whom you can present on a scale of     
negative to positive left to right.    
    
Most positive means they can exist independently,     
they should be more.     
Most negative means they should not be there,     
They are 100% dependent on other professions.    
    
Neutral means they in a happy society they should be minimum.     
They are a problem fixer.    
    
You can add more professions here     
and try decorating these on a colorful scale.     
You will have fun arranging them.    
    
Farmer, Cook, Artist, Musicians, Scientist,     
Technologists, Trader, Accountant, Automation Expert,     
Goldsmith, Blacksmith, Teacher, Thinker, Writer,     
Dancer, Engineer, Comedian,     
Doctors, Lawyers, Police, Warrior     
Salesman, Marketer, HR Professional     
NewsMaker, Politicians, Brokers     
Thief, Robber, Terrorist, Smugglers, prostitute,     
poison maker, drug manufacturer,

O Chaitanya, if a human with the given     
superior cerebral system     
doesnâ€™t behave like an animal     
they live healthy and ready to leave the body     
when time is over     
then what are those professions     
without which human can live happily?
