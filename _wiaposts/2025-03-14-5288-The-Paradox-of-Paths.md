# The Paradox of Paths

When we’re learning or exploring,  
whether it’s a new skill, a career move,  
or simply life itself,  
we often crave certainty.  
We want a map, a list of steps, a clear destination.  
But here’s the paradox:  
sometimes, knowing too much holds us back,  
while not knowing enough pushes us forward.

Consider this as well:  
If you don’t know where you want to go,  
then no road will help.  
If you don’t know where you are,  
then any road will help.  
If you don’t know where you want to go  
and where you are,  
then your interest in the travel  
is nothing but exhausting yourself.  
But if you still travel,  
then it is like walking on a large circle of a playground.  
Whole life you can remain busy on the roads of life  
and reach nowhere,  
except dropping tirelessly one day  
in the graveyard or on the cremation ground.

Imagine standing at a crossroads  
with no clue where you want to go.  
Every road looks the same,  
and no guidebook can tell you which is best.  
All the roads are possible options.  
You might think this is a recipe for analysis paralysis.  
A mind overloaded with choices grows  
tired, bored, even sleepy, mistaking confusion for wisdom.  


Help command on computer terminal  
can give you list of all the commands.  
Help cry in the society can inspire  
someone around you to help you.  
But, what will you do with that long help documentation  
or good-hearted helpful people around,  
when you yourself are not clear  
what do you want? Where you want to go?

Now imagine you know where you want to go  
but you don’t know where you are standing.  
Then any road will help.  
Because any road becomes a possibility.  
Instead of overthinking the “perfect” path,  
you pick one and move.  
Motion itself becomes the teacher.  
A few steps in, you’ll sense  
if it’s leading somewhere meaningful or not.

So, when you’re learning or exploring, embrace the uncertainty.  
Lack of not knowing your starting point  
or not knowing your destination is ok,  
as long as you are ready to walk to seek the purpose.

Lack of actions is big problem.  
Thinking that having options is good  
and then not choosing any option  
is a definite path of frustration and failures.

O Chaitanya! Do you know why did you come again in this world?  
Do you know where you are standing today?  
Do you definitely know  
where you want to go in this life journey?  
Do you know what are roads leading to your destination?  
If not, then find your starting point and your goal.  
Seeking, surfing, skimming, wandering   
purposelessly on roads, phone screen or on the internet   
endlessly can exhaust you.
