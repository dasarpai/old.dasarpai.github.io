# Undying Love   
   
Love, Respect, and Trust are     
the foundation of any relationship.    
You name any relation like your Ishta, mother, father,     
guru, wife, husband, son, daughter, daughter-in-law.    
Remove love, respect and trust from that relationship.    
That relation becomes like dry wood.    
    
You put these three things     
in any unknown relation.    
Even without name that     
relation becomes most valuable.    
So it is not important     
What is the name of the relationship?    
It is important whether Love, Respect, and Trust     
is there in the relationship or     
it has dried away over the age of that relation.    
    
Keep in mind that Love, Respect and Trust is mutual    
But it never means     
you respect me and I respect you.    
You trust me and I trust you.     
You love me and I love you.    
Love, Respect, and Trust mean as an     
individual's your ability     
to Love, Respect, and Trust     
under all circumstances of life.     
No matter what others do to you.    
After all it is your ability.    
    
Circumstances in life     
will take you on a roller coaster ride     
but never ever lose your ability     
to Love, Respect, and Trust.     
People may go away, die and turn into your enemy     
but you should never surrender     
your ability to Love, Respect and Trust.    
Remain full of life.    
Without these three, you cannot breathe freely.    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Yours Truly Hari
