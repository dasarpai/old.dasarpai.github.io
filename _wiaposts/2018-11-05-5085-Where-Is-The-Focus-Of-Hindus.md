# Where Is The Focus Of Hindus?   
    
Every religion has three main functions     
Inspire the public to believe in god, called Bhakti.     
Inspire the public to work for god, called Karma.     
Inspire the public to understand     
the nature of God’s creation and God.     
This is Gyan, Darshan, and Philosophy.    
    
Christianity has focused their     
more energy in the Karma aspect.     
So they created many missionaries,     
uplifted the education, and health of their people.     
How did they do? whom they benefited?     
why they did etc, all will become     
too much complicated and political     
so avoiding in this article.     
But the truth is their Karma brought     
some physical comfort to individual human beings.    
    
Islam focused on Bhakti more.     
They taught Kuran in Madarsas to all their followers.     
So the output is believers.     
What did they teach? What did people understand?     
Why did followers fail to understand?     
What is the impact of that     
again that is a topic of big debate.    
    
Hinduism got mixed up and     
remain unfocused with all these aspects.     
Organizations like Ramakrishna Mission focused on Karma,     
Organizations like Patanjali Yoga Peetha on Swadeshi and business,     
Organizations like Sringeri Matham on Philosophy and Darshan,     
Organizations like ISKCON and many others on Devotion, Bhakti.    
    
Hence when it comes to infrastructure,     
Like created by churches, Hindus are nowhere.     
When it comes to believers,     
fortunately, Hindus couldn’t create hardcore believers as well.     
They try to apply their mind     
and even do trading and negotiation with God.     
What is in it for me if I give my ten rupees to god?    
    
When it comes to philosophy     
Hinduism has given many philosophers     
of the highest order to the world.     
It may be different that     
not many people around today     
but still situation is not that bad.    
    
Now if we blame that poor Dalit or backward class     
getting converted into other religions     
then it is not because of Hindu philosophy     
or too much torture on low caste people.     
Even high class but poor people also getting converted.     
And suffering is across the Jati and Varna of the entire Hindu system.    
    
It is because our focus was not     
building infrastructure to serve.     
Everything is fine, but for some time     
if we reduce preaching philosophies     
and performing Katha Keertan     
and focus that energy on creating     
infrastructure then this conversion problem     
and politics can be addressed.    
    
Do you think this right path for Hindus?     
Do you think there are people     
who can understand this gap and     
channelize their energy     
to build the community in this way?     
Do you think that those who have money and network power     
will use that for this purpose?    
    
Finally, the government should not be     
controlling temples in the secular state and     
there must strict guidelines for temples     
so that they use their funds     
for community and infrastructure     
building and not in corruption and self-serving.
