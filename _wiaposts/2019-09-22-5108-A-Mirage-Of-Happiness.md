# A Mirage Of Happiness
    
People are Chasing Happiness     
And arguing measuring Happiness Index     
is better than GDP Index     
I thought to talk with you about my journey.    
    
In a desert, I walk and run     
In the hope of water     
The desire for water is real in me     
But not real water there     
How to drink that nectar of this planet,     
Which is nowhere here in this desert?    
    
Happiness is that kind of mirage land     
For which human have a real desire     
To drink but nowhere there is the world     
Except it is perceived at the far distance or     
At the backyard of some other person’s house or     
At the trough in the desert.    
    
But when you reach there after your long journey     
Then you realize it is not here too     
We keep inspiring fellow travelers     
To walk a little more, to work a little more     
You will get it when you reach there or     
achieve which you value in life.    
    
We are inspiring people to achieve that     
Which we ourselves never got outside     
Our children work hard to achieve that     
Which we don’t have     
A child can work hard to follow elders     
You can motivate a child     
to work hard for a whole day     
And finally, give him a chocolate     
so that he can feel good.     
But a child in me has understood     
the trick of people around me     
You want to keep me busy the whole day     
for a bar of chocolate that too when I am not hungry.    
    
I am a child of the goddess of death     
I want to play just because     
I am out from my mother’s lap and     
Not because I want to become happy     
by taking your tempting chocolate     
But because I love to play.    
    
This world is a mirage of happiness     
There is no happiness there     
It is not an object to get anywhere but     
It is my experience during play     
I don’t get happiness but I am happiness     
A mad run for that which I am and     
I am established in that.    
    
O Chaitnya, know thyself that     
in essence, you are nothing but Ananda     
But without knowing your essence you are     
running like a dear is running for a musk.    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Yours Truly Hari    
    
Until Next Time Stay Blessed
