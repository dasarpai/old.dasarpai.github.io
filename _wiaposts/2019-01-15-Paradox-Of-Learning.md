# Paradox Of Learning
    
If you listen to some idea with an empty mind,     
no previous knowledge or     
setting aside your previous knowledge,     
then either in reality or pretentious way     
you are accepting there is no existing neuron     
in your brain which has any information     
related to the idea being spoken.    
    
In that state listening becomes a boring process,     
you get tired, sleepy, restless and     
you want to leave the learning setup.    
    
If you listen and try to relate the subject     
with some other related or     
unrelated known experiences     
then learning is biased by     
your existing knowledge.    
    
In this situation,     
you have questions ready without     
analyzing the answer from the speaker     
from all different angles.     
Hence, you are not able to listen     
what is being said but listening     
which justifies the existing experience.    
    
It looks it is almost impossible     
to listen with an empty mind.     
Especially a subject where you have spent     
your whole life and you ‘think’     
you know it thoroughly.    
    
Probably this is the reason old,     
experienced, people/experts say that     
with this huge experience     
now I understand how little I know.    
    
Do you think “listening with an open mind”     
is a paradoxical statement?
