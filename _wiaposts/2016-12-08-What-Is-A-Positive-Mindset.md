# What Is A Positive Mindset
    
What is positivity? What is positive thinking?     
What is a positive mindset?     
Why is positivity so important?     
Why is negative hated so much?     
What is positivity and what is negativity?     
Is there any plus or minus sign on the events,     
people, thoughts, places, around us?    
    
Despite there is no sign on the objects,     
How do we recognize this is positive and this is negative?     
And how come one thing which is negative is positive for others?     
And something positive is negative for others?    
    
Negative or positive is not absolute characters in nature.     
They are two opposite poles of an infinite line     
These opposite poles can be called negative or positive     
This imaginative line doesn’t have     
distinct negative or positive at any specific place.    
    
On this imaginative line to decide, these are two opposite sides     
You need to know the location of the center     
But on the infinite line, you cannot locate a center     
Every point is a center on an infinite line.    
    
Have any seen negative signs on an electron?     
Has anyone seen a positive sign on a proton?     
Has anyone seen a positive sign on a laughing face?     
Has anyone seen a negative sign on a bitter face?    
    
From our experience, we know     
earth exists, earth has north and south pole     
We know the earth has the magnetic character of south and north pole     
But no one can point a location on the earth     
that from here north or south pole of magnet starts.    
    
So negative-positive, good-bad, day-night they look like the contrast     
and they exist in our experience,     
but our experiences are based on relativity.     
Even after heavy use of this word “absolute”     
There is nothing absolute in our experience!    
    
How easy it is to say think positive     
when you are in the kitchen and boiling milk spill over the stove?     
when you are drinking coffee and coffee falls on your new clothes?     
when you are hungry; eating your food     
and that time your food plate falls from the table     
and there is nothing else in the kitchen?    
    
when you were rejected by the interviewer in the last round?     
when you missed your flight for a critical business meeting?     
when your customer gives you zero-rating     
for your work, product, or service?    
    
when you hear from your partner or children,     
what you have done for me?     
when somebody hits your car, abuses you, beats you,     
and wants compensation because he is a big person     
and his big car also got damaged as yours?    
    
If we cannot think positive in these situations, then     
for what purpose this positive thinking preach is given?    
    
Is positive thinking about hoping for happening which you wish?     
Is positive thinking about hoping against all the hope?     
Can positive thinking be enforced?     
Can a positive thinking mind be cultivated temporarily?    
    
Is it a normal functioning of the mind?     
Is it about stopping old negative thinking habits of a mind?     
Is it possible to stop negative thinking? How?     
Does your mind even know what is positive or what is negative?    
    
A mind is a faculty like the heart or lungs or eyes.     
It works on inputs, without bothering what is the input.     
It is the Dharma (nature/duty) of a mind to think.     
It is the Dharma of the lungs to clean the inhaled breath.     
It is the dharma of the heart to pump the blood to body parts.     
Mind, lungs, and hearts process whatever is available to them.    
    
Is it possible to have a positive mind     
without developing a habit of deeper thinking?     
Without understanding the deeper meaning of events,     
objects and relations around?     
Foolishly people think deeper thinking causes problems.    
    
A child was eating groundnuts from a bowl     
and the bowl falls on the ground.     
Bowl is broken, groundnuts spread on the entire room,     
and the child is crying.     
Mother says don’t worry,     
I will fix that but can you tell me many groundnuts I gave to you?     
The child says wait I will count.     
The child counts and collects all groundnut in another bowl.     
Mother cleans the floor     
The child learned to see the meaning of the event.    
    
The kitchen is just cleaned,     
A housewife preparing tea for her family     
tea spill over the stove and makes the entire area dirty     
finally not enough tea for all members.     
Mother says you have not offered food to fire for long.     
Today if one cup of tea is offered to fire then feel blessed.     
After Havan, we need to clean the floor.     
So, we can clean the kitchen in that spirit.     
She further says sharing, when you have less is a sign of love.     
Anybody can share when it is enough     
So the lady redistribute the same quantity among all     
Lady learned to see the meaning of the event.    
    
A person who was out of his job for six months     
Was rejected in his fiftieth interview     
He comes home and writes his diary     
Thank you, God for letting me know that     
before I get the best job for me     
I should know these things also     
which my interviewer told me     
That person is learning to see the meaning of the event.    
    
We need to understand the difference between     
hoping against hope and positivity.     
We need to understand, taking everything in our control     
and then expecting now things will happen     
as we want is not about positivity.    
    
We need to understand, leaving everything to god     
and then quoting from scriptures,     
poems of great devotees and philosophers     
that God will do everything     
This is not positivity.    
    
A positive mind is neither lives in helplessness.     
Neither it is endlessly waiting and hoping for what it wants.     
A positive mind is not about being foolishly happy.    
    
A positive mind is cultivated by your     
own long, continuous, sustained efforts.    
    
A positive mind is cultivated when you start     
giving joyful meaning to the events.    
    
A positive mind is about how to be joyful     
in whatever is happening around us.    
    
A positive mind is about how to     
look at events from a different perspective.    
    
A positive mind is about how to seek     
and then give larger meaning     
to the events happening around.    
    
A positive mind is about never becoming bitter for anything     
no matter how dangerous was that.    
    
A positive mind is about thinking constructively     
and giving a befitting response without being     
bitter or attached to some event or person.    
    
A positive mind is not about surrender to the situation.     
A positive mind is not about the devotee’s mind or the enemy’s mind.    
    
A mind that uses past and memories     
but never get hooked to the past in some nostalgia.    
    
A mind that uses future and imagination     
but never get hooked to any fear, anxiety, and excitement    
    
A positive mind is a stable mind.     
So, don’t become prejudice in your mind     
And expect it shall do something and shall not do others.     
Don’t expect mediation will solve the problem.    
    
O mind! don’t think negatively.     
O mind! think positively.     
O mind! stop thinking now.     
Giving these kinds of instructions never ever helps.    
    
O God, O Gurus now I am out of control of my mind.     
So you take control of my mind!     
In some extreme situations, it may work.     
But on day to day basis never let your mind to be a slave     
of other’s thoughts and ideas.     
Do not allow your mind to surrender.     
Surrendering ego is a completely different thing     
than surrendering your capability to think.    
    
All this is possible if your mind is the mind of a seeker     
A mind that is ready to learn     
A mind that does not want to test others     
A mind who is unconditionally interested     
in the inner joy of mind &amp; life.    
    
O Pratibimba, know what kind of mind you have!     
Why you become bore when people are not around you?     
Why you get angry when things do not happen as per your wish?     
Why you become anxious about the future?     
Why you miss that this moment     
when you are reading these words is     
the only true moments and all other     
are your just memories and imaginations.     
So, develop a mind that is always joyful.    
    
Until Next Time Stay Blessed
