# Location Of Mind 
## Where is the human mind located?    
       
Today I am using this space to provoke you to ask subtler questions and know the answer from your experience. There is no answer below but many questions for you. Enjoy reading.    
    
Namaste    
    
We talk so much about the mind     
But can you locate your mind in your body?     
Don’t point your finger towards your head     
That is the location of another     
the physical part of your body called the brain    
    
The brain is another hardware in our body     
like heart, kidney, eyes etc.     
Nothing special to hold the mind in it.    
    
So, the puzzle is this.     
Where is our mind located?     
What are the functions of the mind?     
Is it possible to see the mind,     
Or it is like a ghost, unseen,     
And known only through its Karma?    
    
Observe the physical phenomenon world around     
Solidity is the epitome of physicality     
Mark the order of solidity for following     
Food on a plate, water in a glass,     
Cotton on a cotton flower,     
The air around you, ideas in your mind,     
Restlessness in your body     
Unrest in society, Laugh of children     
Cry of a helpless being, your feeling of love, hate, etc.     
Your desire to win, to create, to enjoy     
Social injustice around you.    
    
What is the nature of that     
which shakes the human heart     
which keeps human in action     
which keep human running     
Is that Physical or non-physical?    
    
A physical is that     
Which can be located     
Which can be measured     
Can be created, destroyed, and converted     
Can be displaced     
Can change the form and the state.     
Thus matter is physical.    
    
Energy is nothing but less density matter     
The same energy when condensate     
Takes different states of physical existence around    
    
They say mind does not matter     
But can we say the mind is not a matter?    
    
Post-death, when the rental body is given back     
to the owner of the body, the Mother earth     
Then they say mind transports to another body     
Dharmic traditions called this rebirth.    
    
Atma is eternally free and pure     
What is that which you want to purify     
by your actions of different types?    
    
What is that part of your body     
which does not have memories?     
even your skin has memories     
that is the reason your skin color is like what it is.    
    
In the poetical world, it is good to express that     
The mind thinks and the heart feels     
But in reality, is that true?     
Think again, what is special in the heart     
for which you give it the responsibility of feeling?     
The heart is another physical part of the body like brain.     
There is no comparison between     
a physical and another,     
which is not solidly as physical.    
    
What is the resting place of our     
hope, emotion, creativity, dreams?     
Is this just another form of chemical energy?     
If so, then why don’t we create     
the best chemical energy for our joy     
rather than running around the world for our joy?    
    
What is conciseness?     
Consciousness is the effect of the physical lives around     
or Consciousness is the cause of entire physical creation?     
Including the physical space and time.    
    
What is awareness?     
Awareness is a cause or effect of consciousness?     
Is awareness possible in an unconscious being?     
Is a conscious being always aware of the surroundings?    
    
Oh Pratibimba, contemplate on this     
with your meditative mind,     
Which you cannot locate     
But it can locate everything for you.    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat
