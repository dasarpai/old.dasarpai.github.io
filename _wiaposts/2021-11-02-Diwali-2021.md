# Diwali 2021   
   
## Prayers and Wishes on the Occasion of Deepawali   
   
Earth has completed one more rotation around the Sun  
Time has turned again and once more  
Diwali of this year has come at my door  
I am ready to go out  
To Light the lamp on the outside of walls of my house.  
To search those whom I lost in 365 days.  
To invite those who went away from me  
To share the sweets prepared by sweet keeper  
To share the gift and to give the warmth.

The festival of light has come again  
At the dawn of my life  
Rama and Sita has gone out from home  
They are wandering and   
it looks they have lost the path to home  
Who can show them the light to return back to home?  
  
There is a lot of light in the street and On the balcony   
but Rama and Sita are still not able   
to find the way back to home.  
Maybe our light is not enough  
In which they can see  
Maybe Ram and Sita has become blind   
in too much light of consumerism and glamour.  
Maybe they are not interested in coming home.  
Maybe they have adjusted themselves   
in the forest of confusion  
and on the roads of madness.

Ram and Sita of our personality  
Has lost the way  
They look tired  
Perhaps they want to return the home  
But in our ignorance  
We have locked the door from outside  
And want to enter inside by knocking on the door.  
  
There is no one inside  
No one will open the door from inside  
If you want to celebrate Diwali at your home  
Then open the door of your home  
Which you closed long back.  
  
You closed the door when you went to  
See and enjoy the world  
To do the shopping  
To make money and earn name and fame  
If you have earned enough  
then let Sita and Ram enter the house  
This time let them celebrate Diwali at their home.

Sita and Ram are the symbols of love in the relationship  
Sita is an example of a wife and friend in a tough time of life.  
Ram is an example of Maryada, Dharma, bravery.  
Maybe if you search you will find   
more attributes of your Sita and Rama.  
More than what new dimensions you find  
It is important that Ram and Sita return in your heart.

In the last year of Covid, so many lost their lives.  
Many of the lost were our closed ones.  
Bodies don’t turn back.  
Memories never leave   
till our mind is working normal, and we are living.  
May the memories of those,   
who are far from you, lighten your heart.  
Bring a big smile on your face.  
May you share that smile with others.  
May you share that smile with your mirror.

May this year Diwali we turn inside   
to search our lost Ram and Sita.  
May this year Diwali Ram and Sita in you   
resolve to dissolve all the bitterness of the relationship.  
May they be better guided by love,   
compassion, commitment, and chastity.

May a relationship have some deeper meaning for you.  
May this Diwali be beyond the transaction of giving and taking gifts.  
May it be much more than a business season.  
May it be a season of the inside journey.  
May it be a season of Ram and Sita’s homecoming.  
May it be a season of self-realization for you.

O Chaitanya, may you become more poise, peaceful mind  
May you have an intellect full of wisdom  
May you have a healthy body  
May you earn and get all the success you want  
May you return home, at least for one day.  
Home, your real home in the waking state of your mind.  
May you live in that home with full awakening   
and without the substance of alcohol, drug, smoke, or any addiction.  
Without any fear, sadness, worry.  
May you live like fearless Dharma.

Hari Om Tat Sat  
Yours Truly Hari
