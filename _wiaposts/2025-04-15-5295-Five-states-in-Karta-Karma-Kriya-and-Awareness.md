# Five states in Karta, Karma, Kriya and Awareness

## Definations: 
Kriya means that which happens automatically within us like breathing, digestion, yawning etc. Normally we don't control that nor we want to control unless some hospital case.

Karta means the doer the person.

Karma means some action physical like sitting, standing, walking etc, or thinking or speaking. They are generally done with intention, but most of time people do this out of habit or compulsiveness.

## Five Meaningful States of Karta, Karma, Kriya and Awareness 
1. Doer is Present, Karma is done, Kriya is happening and you are not aware.
Example: Like walking in a sleep state. Here walker is there, walking is done but Karma is happening like Kriya, the doer is not aware.

2. Doer is absent, Karma is absent, Kriya is not happening and person is not aware.
Example: When one is dead. The experiencer of Karta Bhava is not in the body, no karma is happening, no kriya is happening and person is not aware.

3. Doer is Present, Karma is done, Kriya is happening and person is aware that I have done this.
Example: Normal expected state in living humans. Although there are people who forget after doing and when Karma does the follow up they cry that why I am suffering, I am innocent! It is because people live like in State 1 when doing karma but after that they come to senses.

4. Doer is Present, Karma is absent, Kriya is happening and person is not aware that I am NOT doing but still something is happening in me.
Example: Sleeping. Sleeping person as doer is there, but Karma is not done, Kriya (sleep) is happening and person not aware that I am not doing anything, but I am sleeping.

5. Doer is Present, Karma is done, Kriya is happening and you are aware that I am not doing.
Example: You finish eating, you are aware eating is happening but it is done by my body and I am not the doer. You are aware that all Karma happening within the body like Kriya. Although your body, mind and intellect is involved and so much is achieved and sometimes lost but you are aware doer is not me but my mind, body and intellect. They are functioning as per their swabhav and hence suffer and enjoy as per their swabhav. I am just aware of all the suffering and joy within the body.

This 5th state is extremely difficult. Different school of Philosophy or Darshan shastra talk about different methods to achieve this state. Which method will work for you, you cannot know without adopting and practising for some time. Scriptures of Sanatana Dharma are full of these methods. If one doesn't work with any chosen method, but do the window shopping about all method then nothing changes for better. In fact a confusion happens that I know.

Why it is important to achieve this state? Because in this state only one can transcend all kinds of fears and suffering.

When you nearing towards chaos, when death is near, when all is lost, if you feel all is happening and I am Sakshi (witness) of all this, it means your method is working. In that state of you panic (outwardly looking), if you need help of others or God it means method is not working.

O Chaitanya, what state you live is your choice   
Your suffering and joy all your choice.  
Don't feel helpless and fearful   
All these are events on the screen of time  
and there is seer, timeless Sakshi of these events.

Yours Truly Hari   
Hari Om Tat Sat
