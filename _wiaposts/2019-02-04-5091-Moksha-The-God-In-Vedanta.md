# Moksha The God In Vedanta   
    
The God of Upanishad is not that     
what we “speak about” but the speaker!    
    
Not that which eye can see     
but through which eyes see.    
    
Not that which you pray     
but that in the absence of which     
you cannot pray.    
    
The word “Maya” of Vedanta doesn’t     
mean illusion nor it means it is false.    
    
It means, it is not the way you know,     
experience and see. It is different.    
    
If you want to know the absolute existence, “Satya”     
without Maya then take a step back     
and see everything including     
your mind and body as an object.    
    
Moksha of Vedanta is not received     
from your Bhakti or Karma     
nor it is given by God.     
It is about dropping off     
your notion that you are bound.     
But how that is possible?    
    
If some devil has bounded you     
in the shackles and then disappear     
then some god is required to free you up.    
    
But if you yourself have purchased shackles,     
tightly bounded yourself and then crying for Moksha     
then even if you god come to help you     
you will not be free,     
because you will not handover him     
the key through which you have bound yourself.     
On top of that testing God and waiting for his miracle,     
To free you up without your handover the key of the lock.    
    
Even if some miracle makes you free     
Will you live like a Mukta Jeeva?     
Impossible! because human love to create     
walls for himself and then cry for help and freedom    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Yours Truly Hari
