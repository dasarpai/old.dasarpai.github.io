# The Meaning of Understanding     
   
What do you mean when you say, "I understand"? Sometimes, you might say, "I really understand."

Suppose you have a piece of software code before you, or a philosophical idea is revealed to you (e.g., "God is knowledge and infinite, Satyam Jnyanam Anantam Brahma"), or you have a document (e.g., project requirements) before you. You have read the document or listened to the idea completely, and now you say, "I understand." What does that mean?

"I understand" can have multiple interpretations, such as the following:

- I have read the document.
- I can understand the text of the document.
- I understand why each word, line, and paragraph is written.
- I can explain this document/idea to you.
- I can write this document from memory now.
- I can create a better document than this one.
- I have understood this, but I cannot explain it.
- I have read this, but I could not understand it because it is cryptic, too technical, or in a foreign language with roman letters.
- I read this and found gaps, and I can improve this document.
- I read the document and found gaps, but I do not know how to fix them because I lack complete knowledge of the subject and context.
- I have read it and feel something is missing, but I cannot identify what it is.
- I read it and find it to be a complete, comprehensive, and correct document. As an authority on the subject, I certify the document or endorse or reject idea.
- Now I can feel why the author has written this or the speaker has spoken this.
- Now I can understand the context better.
- I understand this, but I am not sure if there is a better way of writing or saying what I read, listened to, said, or wrote earlier.
- I understand this, but I do not know why this document was given to me or said to me.

Suppose you see a 12-year-old child crying alone because she/he has lost her/his mother. You are a person with a very sensitive heart, and you say, "I understand." What do you mean by that until it has happened to you? And even if it happens to you, your feelings about that event and the child's feelings may differ. This depends on how emotional the child was with his mother, at what age it happened, how dependent he was on her, what surroundings he have to take care of him, etc.

Suppose someone says, "God is with me." Most of the time, people immediately say, "He is with everybody." Do you understand the meaning of that sentence and the background of the person who is speaking?

Suppose you hear from a spiritual guru that Ishwara is Nirguna (attributeless), Nirakara (shapeless, not even like air, water, or light, or electricity because they have some subtle form), Nitya (eternal, in all times of past, present, and future), Ananta (infinite), Sarvatra (everywhere), Anirvachaniya (inexpressible in words and thoughts). Now, if you say, "I understand," it means you have used words and ideas to understand. Effectively, you are saying you understand that which cannot be expressed in words and languages with the help of words and ideas!

In a deep spiritual sense, when we say, "I understand this," you are expressing I am fully aware of my existence, which I cannot express in words because grammar is a result of logic, and life is alogical.
