## The Power For Prayer      
     
If you believe there is no power in the prayer     
Then you can stop doing any prayer of any type.     
If you believe there is power in the prayer     
Then what we reap in our life has     
influence of the prayer of people around us.    
    
Pratibimba had a very good friend     
They both lived together for a long     
They fought, argued, disagreed with each other     
But the sign of love always remain in their heart     
Sign of love was respect, care, no ill will,     
no ill intentions, giving a free space     
to each other to experience the world around,     
and ultimately coming back     
to support each other in all ups and downs of life    
    
One day because of some fate     
they went away from each other     
Over a period of time, they had differences     
Finally, they parted away     
on their journey, both with heavy hearts    
    
Pratibimba decided to remain positive     
So he always prayed for the good health and mind of his friend     
He prayed for a good heart, which is full of love,     
compassion and care for his friend     
In his prayers, his friend was included.    
    
His friend became bitter, because of the circumstances.     
He prayed ill fate, disease, losses,     
defeat and death for his friend     
His heart became black with the experience     
So he prayed worse for his friend.    
    
Time passed, Pratibimba remained positive     
But he had lots of problems in his life     
Had many legal cases, defame, loss of money     
this is what his friend prayed for him.    
    
On the other hand, his friend had a normal life     
But his friend’s heart started melting     
He became sweet, full of love, compassion,     
respect and care for all around     
So he became positive and     
compassionate for Pratibimba.     
This change of heart happened     
because of prayer from Pratibimba    
    
One day Pratibimba’s friend     
decided to search Pratibimba     
Finally, he could find his whereabouts     
He found Pratibimba has lost everything in life     
Struggling for his life on the hospital bed     
But he is still praying     
for his friend and the world around him.    
    
When his friend went to meet     
Pratibimba in the hospital     
His heart broke and he cried     
He said to God, why did you hear my prayers     
And brought so much unfortunate to my friend.    
    
Pratibimba was happy and ecstatic     
The tear was flowing from his eyes,     
After seeing his friend before he died     
He said to God thank you so much for listening,     
to my prayers and making my friend     
a sweet and compassionate     
But what is this, today I cannot utter a word     
I cannot raise my hands to wipe his tears.    
    
Such is the power of prayer     
It definitely brings results     
It may take time     
but never goes unheard    
    
Therefore don’t wish ill,     
even for your enemy.     
Who knows, this has a seed     
of you being guilt in your life    
    
Time moves in a circle     
Life moves in a circle along with time.     
When an enemy becomes friends     
or friends become enemy,     
only time knows.    
    
Oh wise reader, can you find     
which a friend gained more from his prayers?     
Don’t be in hurry, think again
