# Who Is Guru
    
We all know the Samskrut definition of Guru     
The remover of darkness.     
But whose darkness?     
How does he remove?     
What is this darkness about?     
What is the meaning of remove?    
    
In Omkara Dharma tradition,     
Knowledge &amp; Wisdom has been so important     
that from the time immemorial     
Many people came forward.     
At the time of leaving for the cause of Knowledge &amp; Wisdom     
Some of these people had comfortable life and some didn’t    
    
But, one thing was common.     
The concern for the humanity and selflessness     
Selflessness means they didn’t start new journy     
for their personal gain and glory    
    
Concern for humanity means     
Compassion, love, respect, forgiveness     
is diminishing among the human of society     
People in the society are becoming so     
Self-centrist that whether this life or post death life     
They just look for their comfort     
That too at the cost of other around them     
So, to bring the society to the     
center of humanity    
    
Guru is not a proper name it is a common name     
It is like prime minister or president     
Whoever fill that position is called prime minister     
But prime minister is position of democratic system     
Guru is position which is neither democratic or self procalimed     
It always existed in the Omakara Dharma tradition    
    
According to different Sampradaya     
They say first Guru is Shiva or Vishnu or Brahma     
Some wise people say they all are same     
Some say they are different position     
Some even say they are not proper noun     
But common noun.    
    
A power which destruct is Shiva     
A power which maintains is Vishnu     
A power which creates is Brahama     
But these powers are not physical in nature    
    
Like if your remove a person     
from a prime minister position     
What happens to person? He becomes common man.     
What happens to power? It remains.    
    
Either cabinet exercise or     
new coming person will exercise that power     
So, even if we keep people away,     
To whom we worship     
These powers are eternally there    
    
From our ancient wisdom stories     
We know that the powers and position     
to create, maintain and destruct were     
never filled by any individual     
like Indra’s position was filled by powerful kings    
    
We know from traditions     
that these three powers always existed     
They are not human nor they are human like     
For meditation or worship we give them     
the form which most suites to our mind    
    
Interestingly in Omkara Dharma tradition     
Either Vishnu is Adi Guru or Shiva is Adi Guru     
But Brahma is that first power     
who got the wisdom from the Adi Guru    
    
From the wisdom He created the world     
But even he is not Adi Guru     
He is called Guru     
That is why famous sloka     
Guru Brhama, Guru Vishnu, Guru Devo Maheshwara    
    
In the entire system of Omkara Dharma     
From the time immemorial     
uncountable number of people     
who have come forward and     
refined the body of knowledge    
    
The purpose was not to create new book     
Or copy right or their worship from common people     
The purpose was to give direction to the society    
    
Bharadwaj, Vishamitra, Vashista,     
Veda Vyasa, Patanjali, Gautam, Kanad,     
Siddhartha, Rushabhadeva, Mahavir Jain,     
Chankya, Adi Shankara, Guru Nanak,     
Kabir, Tulasidas, Ramkrishna Paramhamsa,     
Vivekananda, Dayananda Saraswati is just starting list     
Your can write a book just with names of these people    
    
Unlike other religions which are history based     
Omkara dharma never ever bothered about time and history     
For us person was not important     
For us time was not important    
    
We don’t care whether Gandhi said or     
Krishna said or Buddha said     
We don’t care when it was said     
We care and worship that     
Who did enough Tapasya     
And based on his wisdom     
What he did versus what he said?    
    
Whatever was done by him     
whether that was inline with our Dharma or not.     
Whether based on the need of time     
that was contextualized or not     
That was important for us    
    
Unlike today’s time when most of the people     
Have lost touch with ancient knowledge-base     
Some has knowledge about the book     
But they cannot contextualize    
    
Some people try but refer to some old book     
so many times that public start feeling     
why are you going so much back in 21st century     
It is not about the respect, but about the connect.    
    
We need to understand people in Omkara Dharama     
At any point of time never bothered about     
What is written in book.     
We were never book driven society     
Tradition of writing came very late.    
    
When knowledge base was getting lost     
Because people were dying and     
entire chain of knowledge getting wiped out     
So, we understood the importance of documenting    
    
Otherwise, we were very practical     
We always question.     
What is there for me if I do that?     
Then what is there for my people, my tradition and my Rastra?     
If you tell them it is written in such a such book     
Such sloka and such page they will laugh at you    
    
Since few centuries, our mind has been conditioned     
Because of western education &amp; western influence     
All the time referring to people.     
Who said what, and what is written in which Holi book,     
which chapter and which page number    
    
That is why, today when we share quote     
We mentions, who said that,     
As if it copy right problem or     
they know that they do not have courage to say that     
or practice that and people will laugh     
so it is better to use name of some Holi book     
or some great philosopher or scientist    
    
Have you ever seen great Upanishad text     
being referred which Rishi said that?     
Either people do not remember what is written there     
Or they do not remember who said what     
Or people have read so much English text     
that they feel filled and enlightened    
    
Guru of anytime were those people     
Who took this bold charge     
They left their personal comfort     
Because they had deep pain in their heart     
They came forward to give direction to the society    
    
Did society accepted them?     
You ask yourself,     
did Rama, Krishna, Buddha, Mahavira, Kabira,     
Mirabai, Vivekananda or any Guru lived a unopposed life?     
Never ever! when they lived they had     
enough opponent to keep them on toe    
    
They struggled enough but never     
Deviated from their path     
We worship them not as individual     
But as Guru-Satta, Dharma-Satta    
    
Because of their efforts and sacrifice     
We are here today in 21st century, as a thriving civilization     
Otherwise we could have been finished thousand years back    
    
Where are original habitat of America, Europe, Africa?     
They all are killed, finished!     
Where is their knowledge system?     
All digested by ruler and new religion!     
Why? Because these societies had great people &amp; great minds     
But they couldn’t produce Guru    
    
A person who is punching bag of the society.     
When a guru lives     
He gets punch from his family members     
his friends, pupils, opponents, society     
And in today’s time even from media    
    
But these are the people who don’t care about anything     
They even don’t care about     
their personal name, fame, gain &amp; business     
If it is there it is fine     
If it is not there that too is fine    
    
In ancient time also     
Guru control king but lived in forest     
They ran universities but never lived in luxries     
They ran business but not for themselves     
They ran hospitals but not for making money     
They offered several social program not for their TRP    
    
All was to comer forward and lead from the front     
So that other take inspiration and do it right way    
    
In today’s time our mind is conditioned that     
Guru is Godman, he gets power from god     
Therefore he should not do business     
Should not indulge in politics     
Should not do social reforms     
Should not live in society     
They should live in forest like some ancient people     
This is all media coined definitions &amp; expectations from Gurus    
    
This all is being pushed upon us by self-interested western forces     
If we have concern for society and Rastra     
Then we should be very careful     
About such interpretation     
That what Guru should do and what not     
We are not frozen society     
who will follow what is written in Holi books.    
    
We do what is needed     
That is the why Guru becomes punching bag of the society     
If they start following Holi books word by word     
and Remain cut from everything     
and let the society, politics and business     
go to the dogs then western interest group will be happy,     
because they get opportunity to fill the space.    
    
We should never ever be prejudice about the people     
Look what they are doing     
Look what we are doing     
Can we renounce and become punching bag like them?     
Can we help them?    
    
If nothing then remain silent     
We have lost the ability to preach if we cannot practice     
It is not cricket game that by watching commentary     
you teach Virat Kohli how to play a six    
    
It is about taking society forward     
Keeping them alive at the cost of a life called Guru     
Don’t speak against the tradition of Guru Shishya Parmpara     
It has given us our identity     
But at the same time we need to understand     
That Guru is not a person     
It is not a proper noun, It is a common noun     
Who ever fill that space becomes Guru     
Ask yourself, who fills that space in your life.    
    
If you find none then     
Either you are the greatest of all time     
Or a selfish of height     
Or an ignorant about contribution of others     
Or an arrogant or a commentary maker     
Or an ungrateful for the lifes of past and present     
who have given you opportunity to breath     
in today’s vibrant democracy     
In all cases you have to think,     
what is missing in me,     
which made me like this.    
    
On the occassion of Guru Poornima of 2019     
I offer my these words as a Pranami     
to the entire Guru-Satta    
    
Who kept their personal life &amp; comfort aside     
And drove out us from darkness to light     
The light of the life that exists today     
The light of the live festivals and events     
The light of the joy &amp; happiness that in spite of     
we billions people, we are living     
as one tradition of thousands of inter-woven traditions    
    
The light of wisdom of balancing old wisdom with current challenges     
The light of wisdom of remaining context sensitive and not dying in books     
That is why our society is not in frozen in books    
    
Thank you my Guru for being part of my life     
Inspiring me all the time     
Giving me hope and purpose     
and being my punching bag     
Enduring all the pain given by me and society     
Because you lived for Dharam and not for yourself    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Yours Truly Hari
