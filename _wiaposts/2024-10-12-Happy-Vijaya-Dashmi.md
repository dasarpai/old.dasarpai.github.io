# Happy Vijayadashami 2024   
   
Hindus celebrate Durga Puja and remember the stories of Goddess Durga fighting and defeating demons. This festival is celebrated for nine days, culminating on the 10th day, known as Vijayadashami. 

During these nine days, we recite the *Durga Saptashati*, which consists of 13 chapters. In the first 10 chapters, various demons are vanquished by Goddess Durga.

A complete list of the *Asuras*, *Daityas*, and *Danavas* killed by Goddess Durga in the *Durga Saptashati* is provided below. These demons symbolize different human tendencies that are the cause of *dukkha* (suffering) for individuals and society as a whole. By reading their names, you can identify these tendencies. Discovering and overcoming them within yourself is the true essence of Vijayadashami.

For the average person, it is difficult to remember the names of all these demons. Hence, we created a master symbol—*Ravana*. All the demons represent different tendencies, and Ravana is the symbol of all symbols. By burning Ravana, we symbolically destroy all these demons.

But ask yourself, if all these demons are truly destroyed this Vijayadashami, do you experience peace in your life? If not, then the demon still lives within you. Thus, burning Ravana externally is symbolic and ineffective if you don't work to eliminate the inner demons.

Yes, there are problems in families, societies, nations, and the world. All these issues arise from certain demonic tendencies that prevail in society. However, it is your own inner demons that disturb your peace.

### Demons from the Durga Saptashati:

- **Chapter 1**: *Madhu* and *Kaitabha*: Two Asuras born from the earwax of Vishnu, who are slain by him at the request of Goddess Mahakali.
- **Chapter 2**: Mahishasura's commanders: *Chikshura*, *Chamara*, *Udagra*, *Mahahanu*, *Asiloma*, *Vidalaksha*, *Vaskala*, *Durmukha*, *Tamra*, and *Andhaka*.
- **Chapter 3**: Mahishasura’s Army.
- **Chapter 4**: *Mahishasura*: The buffalo demon who wages war against the Devas.
- **Chapter 5**: *Shumbha* and *Nishumbha* Prepare for War.
- **Chapter 6**: *Dhumralochana* and his army.
- **Chapter 7**: *Chanda*, *Munda*, and their army.
- **Chapter 8**: *Raktabija*.
- **Chapter 9**: *Nishumbha’s* army, and then Nishumbha.
- **Chapter 10**: *Shumbha’s* army, and then Shumbha.

I wish, if not all atleast one Asura within is destroyed by you so that you may experience inner peace and self-fulfillment in your life. What that one is you can identify yourself, based on your own experience and priority.

Wish you a very joyful Vijayadashami!
