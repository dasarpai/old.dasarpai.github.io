# The Concept Of Six Sins
    
Science taught us that     
we evolved from unicellular life     
to monkeys and chimpanzees etc and finally humans.     
Our consciousness is a phenomenon     
of chemical reactions in the body.     
So we are nothing but a physical being.     
Physical destroyed, we are finished! Stop! Over!    
    
Religion teaching us morality.     
Kaam (Desire), Krodh (Anger), Mada (self-pride),     
Lobh (Greed), Matsarya( Jealousy) are gates to hell.     
Avoid these, they are the sins.     
Control them. Discipline yourself, learn morality, etc.    
    
But very few challenge science     
by asking whether consciousness is the outcome     
of the physical or physical world     
has come from consciousness.    
    
Quantum physics is trying that     
but still, not many scientists are not open     
to accept that causation is downward,     
i.e. first there is infinite, eternal consciousness     
and then the creation and desolation     
of the world in that consciousness.     
Even physical space is a child of that all-pervading,     
always existing consciousness principle.    
    
And very few ask questions     
to religious people that if all is bad     
then what you are saying is     
your god has put inside     
all these bad in human beings,     
and all are suffering.     
Even innocent animals are not spared by your God.     
In fact, these problems are more in the human than in animals.     
Rarely people challenge this design of god.     
Those who challenge this concept     
they try to become Liberal, scientists, thinkers, etc.    
    
But the fact is humans are like this.     
Either because of past karma     
or because of god or because of the environment.     
So the problem is not kaam, krodh etc.     
It is an integral part of the design     
and the Creator’s design is not faulty.    
    
The problem is limited identity.     
Why don’t we spend money on educating human     
that you are like the way you are.     
This is the perfect outcome of the evolution process.     
So, be endlessly greedy, angry, etc,     
don’t hide this don’t feel upset.    
    
But first understand truly, correctly, and convincingly     
that you are a non-physical being.     
The physical you are holding right now     
is not even equal to a particle of dust     
in this physical visible world.    
    
So behave as if you are nonphysical     
and there is no second non-physical in the entire existence.     
Physical beings are many.    
    
Do whatever best possible     
for this one nonphysical self.     
Go in the world, interact will different physical objects around     
But when it comes to thinking and doing     
then think and do in a most greedy way.     
As if you are serving yourself only,     
There is no second.     
You are the criminal, you are the police     
your the judge and you are the jail.     
You are the earth,     
You are the hell and     
You are a heaven without the second.
