# About Transactions and self   
   
From our experience we say   
Doing transaction of any kind    
Whether social, commercial, religious    
We need another    
But if we don't know about another    
Then transaction can be risky    
It can cause pain, hurt, loss or suffering    
Therefore don't transact with unknown.    
(a frequently used proverb)   
   
But, how do we know someone without transacting?   
After transaction only we know    
Transaction with unknown person maybe good or bad.   
But the same applies to your known    
If you know someone and then transact    
In that case also transaction maybe good or bad.   
   
One need to ask oneself,    
what is cause of his suffering    
Transaction with known people    
Or transaction with unknown people?   
We all know the answer    
Only known can cause suffering highest suffering.   
Unknown doesn't has much power to cause suffering.    
   
Then we need to ask ourselves    
How do I know that I know that person?   
Because that person is my friend since last 30 years?   
Because she is my wife or husband    
living around me since last 20 years?   
Because a person is my son or daughter?   
Because that person is my colleague since last 10 years?   
Is this knowing enough for safe transaction?   
   
   
Thinking that a person is around me    
since last many therefore    
I know him or her is the biggest illusion.   
What is knowing?   
Do you know yourself fully?   
If yes then you should be able to control    
yourself fully and you shouldn't suffer.   
But we suffer, because we don't know ourself and   
the behavior of other can upset us.   
   
We don't know what we are eating is nutritious for me not    
We don't whether studying something    
will help me fulfilling my life or not.   
Getting married to someone can please my mind or not    
Having some car or house or job or children    
Will please and settle me or not   
Recovering from a disease will make me happy or not.   
Winning a lottery will make me happy or not.   
   
For the time being we feel happiness    
and then we start suffering again    
If the nature our mind is such then   
We don't know ourselves    
And in that situation saying    
Transaction with unknown will cause pain and suffering    
Is not wise idea.   
If you don't know yourself    
then transacting with even known will cause you suffering,    
if not today then wait for some more time.   
   
Sansar Vyavhar - transaction are cause of pain,    
pleasure, joy and suffering    
for those who don't know their mind   
But those who can live in Sakshi Bhava   
Even with all kind of transactions    
All kind socially perceived suffering and joy   
There is no suffering    
There is no joy.   
It is blissfully doing what is needed at that time because    
Desh Kaal Paristhithi - Time space and situation.   
And blissfully living in the awareness    
   
O Chaitanya, do you know your mind?   
This is more important than    
knowing the people and objects around    
Because your cause of suffering is not knowing    
or not knowing the people around    
But your not knowing the self   
Not knowing the mind of self!

Hari Om Tat Sat
