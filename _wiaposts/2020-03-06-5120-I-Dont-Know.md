# I Don't Know   
    
When physics is saying 95% of the cosmos is dark matter and dark energy, and what we are analyzing is only 5% of the whole matter and energy. This 5% is made of the atom, which is 99.9999% empty. This empty space is again unknown.    
    
So when we do not know anything about 99.999995% of the existence. In this situation saying the hardware is the basis of intelligence is too early for a science. I think it is safe to say that as a human we don’t know enough. It makes me mad when religious people or believers say that their God and their book have the answer to everything many centuries ago. But if you ask them please help me they refer to some person who they don’t know personally or who is equally illiterate or to a book which they themselves have not read at all or not understood properly.    
    
"I don’t know anything" is the safest point from where one can start one’s journey. Read, ask people, debate but more than that contemplate on the meaning and comprehend. A real seeker should not behave like a full and closed container. Shraddha does not mean believe. Shraddha should help the seeker in asking meaningful and deeper questions, not the surrender of intellect and dulling the mind.
