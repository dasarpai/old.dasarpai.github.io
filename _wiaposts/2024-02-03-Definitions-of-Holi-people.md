# Definitions of Holi people & institutions  
  
I notice that people often use these terms very loosely without understanding their underlying meanings. Additionally, when I engage in defining these terms, many individuals adopt the "all are the same" philosophy. They employ the same old, meaningless logic that all gods are the same. Unfortunately, they fail to grasp the distinction between "Devta" and "God," concluding that since there are many "devatas," there must be many gods. This Western mindset hinders the understanding of Bhartiya culture and often leads to fruitless arguments. In this article, I attempt to define some key terms based on my understanding of the Sanatana Knowledge system. You are most welcome to improve these definitions if necessary. I hope this helps my  readers.

## Who is **Muni (मुनि):** ?  
A Muni is one who engages in Mananam, the act of thoughtful contemplation and introspection. A Muni maintains the vow of silence to prevent distractions during penance (tapas). This individual is adept at mental speculations and deep thinking, often living in retirement, meditating, and observing the vow of noble silence (mauna).  
  
## Who is **Rishi (ऋषि):** ?

Another list, mentioned in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2.2.6, comprises Gautama, Bharadvaja, Visvamitra, Jamadagni, Vashista, Kasyapa, Atri, and Brighu.
