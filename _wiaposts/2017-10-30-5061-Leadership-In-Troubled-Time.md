# Leadership In Troubled Time
   
Enough we read, hear and lecture     
Especially in the management profession and leadership positions.     
Life every moment unfolds surprises     
Many bring joy and others brings failure and sadness together.    
    
We know success has many fathers     
But there is no father of failure     
Beyond the words, quotes, and poems     
Many times in life we need to experience     
all that severe pain in our life to understand.    
    
Sitting in one place, we want to experience     
what we understand is imagination.     
On the other hand, we understand and comprehend     
that what we experience is true life.    
    
We all know win-lose, success and failure is part of life     
Taking responsibilities, blaming others     
is part of a regular business game.    
    
By chance or by choice     
How many times you are at a place where you should be     
And empathize the way it should be.    
    
It never comes from rehearsing,     
acting & repeating those old quotes     
But it comes spontaneously.    
    
Photographers may catch or miss the moment     
But you as a leader never fail to fill the other’s     
heart with hope and energy     
And say without speaking –     
Stand up and bounce back.    
    
See this 30 seconds Video, Another Angle     
This comes at the last moment failure of Chandrayaan 2     
Watch the emotions of two great leaders     
One is the tallest political leader of all time     
and another is a leader of ISRO.    
    
Enemy states, political commentators,     
critics will pass their own comments.     
And that is their profession.     
But you observe it yourself     
Ask, how many times you have this kind of boss around?     
How many times you are this kind of boss for your team?    
    
I am not a fortune teller     
But mark my words,     
if these two people have enough life     
to serve the nation     
they will do exceptional work for the science     
and in turn for the society     
because of that emotional energy and support,     
Which is expressed at tough moments of life.    
    
Beyond the boardroom meetings,     
presentations, metrics, chilling review meetings,     
competition, firing, and criticizing people around.     
Can we demonstrate this kind of warmth?     
Can we fill our team with this kind of energy?     
Very difficult, why?    
    
Because you need to be absolutely fearless to do this.    
    
If one is not professional,     
doesn’t know his work     
doesn’t have the required skills     
doesn’t do his work in an utmost selfless way    
    
will have fear of his job, criticism, reputation     
That kind of people can never transfer this kind of energy.    
    
Every organizations or person work for the goal,     
some get success and some not     
But only those live     
Who lives with unconditional     
empathy, humanity to a dedicated team.
