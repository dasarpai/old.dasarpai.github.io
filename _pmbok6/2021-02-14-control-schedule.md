## Control Schedule

Once the deliverables and schedule have been promised to the stakeholders. The project team should be committed to complete the planned activities as per the schedule. Monitor the actual time taken to complete the activities, measure the schedule variation if any, compare the variation against the allowed limit, analyze the reasons for variation. Prepare a detailed corrective action plan so that whatever possible time can be recovered. Prepare a detailed preventive action plan so that in the future you can avoid certain activities that cause delays. If there is a variation that is causing an overall delay in the deliverables or milestones or phase, then forecast the schedule which is doable.
