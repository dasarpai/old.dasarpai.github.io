## Manage Project Knowledge

We know the OPA (Organizational Process Assets) of the organizations contains precious knowledge but the problem is how to use that knowledge that is lying on some servers? **Manage Project Knowledge** process enables that knowledge so that it is easily able to the project team. You may have noticed that somebody creates some document/ template/ guide with a great effort hoping that other people will be able to use it or I will reuse this in the future, but when we/our team need that document we spend more time in searching than it took to create! Either we want to access the knowledge created by others in the organization or we want to access our own knowledge base we need a system where it is easy to engage with the content provider, creator. It should be accessible in human natural language rather than depending upon exact metadata keywords.
