## Collect Requirements

In this process assigned person(s) needs to collect requirements from the stakeholders. All functional, non-functional, technical, system, quality requirements are collected and documented. All those documents where requirements are documented are collectively called [requirement documentation](/pmbok6/requirement_documentation). Depending on the availability of the stakeholders, technical nature of the project, clarity of scope and requirements, various techniques are used by the team for requirement collection and elicitation.
