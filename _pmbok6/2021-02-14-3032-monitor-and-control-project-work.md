## Monitor and Control Project Work

How the management or customer or you will come to know that whether the project is going as per the approved plan? The only way is to monitor the progress against the plan. Where is the plan for monitoring? In the project management plan! The project management plan includes the plan of project execution, project monitoring and controlling, and project closure. So you need to prepare the performance report of the project work, perform an analysis of the data collected, and make a decision if there is a variance from the base plan. The decision is a change request. A change request can lead to defect repair or preventive action or corrective action.

In nutshell the Monitor and Control Project Work process is for tracking, reviewing, and reporting the progress to meet the performance objectives defined in the project management plan. Monitoring and controlling of all project activities performed throughout the project life-cycle.
