## Expert Judgement

PMBOK is an industry-agnostic project management standard. PMBOK 6th Edition defines 49 processes to manage a project. Every process has defined input, output, [tools &amp; techniques](/pmbok6/pmbok-tools-techniques). But we know that the tools and techniques required to manage a project also depend upon the industry for which we are doing a project. To do the industry-specific work PMI has come up with a beautiful concept called “Expert Judgement”. This term is heavily used in the PMBOK in fact 28 processes out of 47, i.e. 60% of the processes use this term as a tool and technique. But the meaning and purpose of this change from process to process and industry to industry. Broadly expert judgement can be bucketed into the following groups.

- A department within the organization
- Consultants
- Industry Group
- Engineering Associations
- Subject Matter Expert

Keep in mind that it is different from [Organizational Process Assets](/pmbok6/Organizational-Process-Assets), which is related to the processes or artifacts and part of the organization and built earlier.

Many times [PMP](pmi.org) aspirants get confused that a PMBOK process lists many tools and techniques and then one more, Expert Judgement. They think that this is the overuse of the term, either expert judgement or give a list of all those tools and techniques why both. But PMBOK is very cautious about when they are addressing all the industries through this standard. Many a time meaning of this in a process is if you cannot complete the processes using the listed tools and techniques then use expert judgement :).
