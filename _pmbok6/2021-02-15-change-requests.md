## Change Requests

Project is an instrument of change. Hence during the project lifecycle changes are inevitable. Therefore **Change Request** in Project Management is an extremely important process in any project.

PMI’s PMBOK helps us handling the change request very carefully throughout the project. As per PMBOK **change request is any deviation from the plan which you need to follow in order to make a project successful.** Therefore change requests can be related to baselines (scope, schedule, cost, quality), plan (risk, communication, resources, procurement, etc), project documents (design, RTM, issue register, risk register, procurement document, etc), organization process assets (OPA), and enterprise environmental factors (EEF). PMBOK 5th edition has defined 47 processes and out of those 16 processes can issue change request at any time in the project life-cycle. And there is only one process that can integrate all change requests and this process is **“Perform Integrated Change Control” (PICC)**
