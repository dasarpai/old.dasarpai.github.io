## Initiating Process Group

Initiating Process Group is the first process group in the PMBOK. But it does not mean all the activities of the processes of this process group are done only once and that too at the start. Some of the activities under the 2 processes of this process group are done during the project life-cycle. Some of the activities of the processes of this process group which are done even during the project life-cycle are as following.

- Stakeholder Identification
- Stakeholder Analysis
- Validating the business case of the project.
- Take approval for the next phase (if the project was signed for only one phase)

This process group has 2 processes
