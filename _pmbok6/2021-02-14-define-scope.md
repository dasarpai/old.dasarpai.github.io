## Define Scope

In this process, the technical team analyzes the requirements from the solution perspective. They need to come up with a clear and unambiguous list of deliverables, acceptance criteria, solution, design, and the architecture of the final system. What is possible or not possible, discussing and negotiating solutions with technical team and customer is also done in this process. What is out of the scope is clearly marked out in the process and a lot of documents get generated here. Collectively all these documents are called [project scope statement](/pmbok6/project_scope_statement). If the solution is really complex or the project is large this may not be the one-time process in the project life-cycle. There may be multiple phases or multiple iterations in each phase to prepare a [project scope statement](/pmbok6/project_scope_statement).
