- How that need to be communicated (phone, email, face to face discussion)?
- What is the format of communication?
- What is the content of the document being shared?
- At what regular frequency this document needs to be shared?
- What is the cost of communication?
- What is the return of communication (benefit)?
- Is it written or verbal?
- Is it formal or informal?
