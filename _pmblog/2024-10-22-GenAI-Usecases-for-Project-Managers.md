# GenAI Usecases for Project Managers

## Introduction

GenAI is a major breakthrough in human evolution. It is definitely very powerful for businesses. You can generate any kind of content using GenAI, whether it's reports, articles, summaries, action items, sentiment analysis, translations, voice-to-text, text-to-voice, text-to-image, text-to-video, voice-to-video, video-to-text, and many more capabilities. 

Project managers can leverage this technology to make their work easier. Since project managers and senior management value clear explanations and detailed, visually appealing reports, it’s important not to use the technology to generate unnecessary documentation. The focus should be on having high-quality, reliable data, and using GenAI when needed to perform useful tasks that aid in decision-making or in presenting cases to stakeholders.

There are three types of organizations, projects, or project managers:

- **Type 1**:  Those who have a well-defined project management framework, a PMO, and use robust project management software like Microsoft Project, Project Online, Primavera, SAP Project Management or any other.
- **Type 2**:  Those who use some project management tools, but they are not fully institutionalized.
- **Type 3**:  Those who either do not use tools or use them rarely or selectively.


## GenAI for Type-1 Organizations or Project or Project Managers
For organizations with a well-defined project management framework, PMO (Project Management Office), and sophisticated tools like Microsoft Project, GenAI can offer a range of advanced, tailored use cases. These organizations already operate at a high level of project management maturity, so the emphasis for them would be on optimizing processes, enhancing decision-making, and improving efficiency. These are more related to institutionalization of GenAI or using GenAI for PMO work. GenAI is great technology to generate all kinds of content, therefore use it cautiously.

**To perform these activities without GenAI, you would need to set aside significant time, or assign them to a dedicated team. If you have a lot of unstructured data (such as emails, reports, specifications, meeting minutes, WhatsApp communications, audio conversations, etc.), it would be nearly impossible to process these activities efficiently without human intelligence. An alternative is to use GenAI. In some cases, your existing project management tools may have AI capabilities, and in other cases, you might need to use external tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama, Einstein, etc.**

There are several ways to utilize GenAI tools:
1. **Create your own GenAI tool** – This is extremely expensive, time-consuming, and often unsustainable.
2. **Use foundational models available in the market and create your own GPT.**
3. **Fine-tune foundational models to meet your specific requirements.**
4. **Prompt engineering** – Provide clear instructions to the model.
5. **In-context learning** – Offer examples and guide the model to generate the desired output.
6. **Use tools like LangChain or Ollama** to create Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.

Each of these techniques has its own pros and cons in terms of cost, time, privacy concerns, and quality.

Now let's see the possible use-cases for Type-1 organizations.

1. **Data pattern search and insights**: GenAI can analyze project performance data across multiple projects to uncover patterns such as recurring risks, common causes of delays, or resource utilization inefficiencies. This can help fine-tune the PMO's methodologies or project templates.
   
2. **Document generation and enhancement**: Automating the generation of high-quality project reports, executive summaries, and project charters while improving clarity, grammar, and structure to match the high standards of documentation required by PMOs.
