## What is Agile? Is it a Business Process Framework?
**Agile** is a methodology and set of principles designed to improve the flexibility and efficiency of project management and software development. It is not a business process framework in the traditional sense, but it can be considered a framework for managing and improving business processes, particularly those related to software development and project management.

### Key Aspects of Agile
Agile is based on the [**Agile Manifesto**](https://agilemanifesto.org/), which outlines four core values and twelve principles for software development.
  
1. **Values**: 
   - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
   - Working software over comprehensive documentation.
   - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
   - Responding to change over following a plan.

2. **Principles**: 
   - Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery.
   - Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.
   - Deliver working software frequently.
   - Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers.
   - Projects are built around motivated individuals.
   - Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication.
   - Working software is the primary measure of progress.
   - Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace.
   - Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design.
   - Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.
   - Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
   - Regular reflection on how to become more effective.

3. **Methodologies**: There are almost a dozen agile methods, some of the popular one are as below.
   - **Scrum**: A framework for managing work with an emphasis on iterative progress through sprints, daily stand-up meetings, and roles such as Scrum Master and Product Owner.
   - **Kanban**: A visual approach to managing work with continuous delivery, limiting work in progress, and focusing on flow efficiency.
   - **Extreme Programming (XP)**: Emphasizes technical practices such as pair programming, test-driven development, and continuous integration.
   - **Lean Software Development**: Focuses on eliminating waste, delivering quickly, and optimizing the whole.

4. **Practices**: There are hundreds of practices, some of the popular for reference purpose are as below.
   - Iterative development: Developing in small, incremental cycles.
   - Continuous integration and delivery: Frequently integrating code and delivering updates.
   - Test-driven development: Writing tests before code to ensure functionality.
   - Stand-up meetings: Short daily meetings to discuss progress and obstacles.
   - Retrospectives: Regular meetings to reflect on the process and make improvements.
