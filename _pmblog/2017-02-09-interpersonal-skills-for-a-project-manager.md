## Nontechnical skills every project manager needs

# Interpersonal Skills

To succeed in any profession you need to strike a balance between the art and science of that profession. Science is about processes, practices, techniques, tools, logic, etc. But art is about knowing what else is required to complete the work. It works as a glue between isolated steps, techniques, stages, processes, or practices. To play a melodious guitar we need to ensure strings are not too tight neither too loose. Knowing this balance is art. It is not about measuring the tension of string using some tool but listening to the sound after striking the cord. What combination of color, what stroke, and in what direction will improve the painting is about art. The project management profession is no exception to this art. This is what generally referred to as the Nontechnical skills of the project manager.

Global standard on Project Management, Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) of PMI emphasizes this as an important tool &amp; technique for every project manager. In PMBOK this tool &amp; technique is called **Interpersonal Skills**. The success of a project hugely depends upon the proficiency of a project manager on these skills.

You cannot learn these skills by force, nor because somebody is paying for it and you sit in class to hear from experts. You learn these skills through your own struggle. But the struggle can path can be shortened when you have some tricks and tips around topics. Training, coaching, mentoring helps you in shortening that path.

If you want to learn flute then you must develop a love for listening flute. You must pay and purchased a good flute and take help from a couple of people around me to play it. Practice it regularly. Now even after many years, if you cannot play it well then it means you are missing deep passion which can absorb your mind in the music a flute. In the absence of this passion, you will not be able to prioritize the time to practice. Anything you want to learn gives you a moment that tells you “forget it, I cannot do it, it is not my cup of tea”. Patience and practice further is the only key to manage those moments of life.

In the project, we struggle even after knowing every process, customer requirement and technology. The primary reason for the struggle is either awareness or proficiency of these soft-skills. But, till the time we do not feel at our heart that makes and break of project hugely depends upon certain soft-skills and I have to master this by my own efforts and strong will, I will not be able to move ahead.
