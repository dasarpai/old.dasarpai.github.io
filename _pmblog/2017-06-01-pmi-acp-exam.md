# Workshop Topics of PMI-ACP Exam

## Introduction

**PMI ACP exam** expects from a candidate who is appearing for the exam that he must understand the following topics. It is an exhaustive check of the knowledge, skills, and attitude. This is the reason I love and value this certificate most over other methodology specific certification of the Agile world. This is best for the both coach level and the introduction level. At the introduction level, it helps a team in understanding what is agile in nutshell. At the coach level, it helps the coach to select the best-suited practices for any organization’s need.
