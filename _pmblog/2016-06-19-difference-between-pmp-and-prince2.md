## Difference between PMP and PRINCE2

Before taking up a **project management certification**, professionals do a lot of research and often get confused with the issue of choosing between the PMP and PRINCE2 certification. Both of these are reputed credentials in the field of project management. I have tried to give you an overview of the two certifications in this article. I hope, this will help you in making the right decision.

## What is the difference between PRINCE2 and PMP certification?

Although PRINCE2 has a different project management framework than the PMI’s PMP certification, the goal of both is to improve the performance or success rate of the project. The choice of certification depends entirely upon the type of industry you are in, geography you are in, customer demand, organization process and practices, your previous experience of managing a project using a certain process that may be near to one of these standards and like other factors. Both these certifications are in high demand and are of equal value for the practitioners.

## What is PMP certification?

The Project Management Professional (PMP)® credential offered by Project Management Institute (PMI)® is one of the highly prestigious, internationally recognized, and sought-after credentials for project managers across all industries worldwide. In order to earn a PMP credential, the candidate has to meet the professional requirements and need to pass the exam conducted by PMI. The exam at any point of time is based on the PMI latest Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) 5th edition that describes the core practices and areas of project management including the five process groups, 10 knowledge areas, and 47 processes.

## What is PRINCE2 certification?

PRINCE2 (an acronym for “Projects IN Controlled Environments”) is the de facto standard in the UK. It was developed for and is used extensively by the UK government, and is widely used in the private sector, in the UK, Europe, and commonwealth countries. PRINCE2 is in the public domain, offering non-proprietary best-practice guidance on project management. PRINCE2 embodies established and proven project management best practices. It can be applied to any type of project – and can easily be implemented alongside specialist, industry-specific models (‘engineering models’ or ‘development life cycles’).

## Prerequisites for PMP and PRINCE2 

### Prerequisites for PMP Certification

For PMP exam there is a set of prerequisites that one has to fulfil:

**10+2+4 years degree holder:** Minimum 3 Years/4500 hours of personal project management experience.

Or

**10+2 years diploma holder:** Minimum 5 Years/7500 hours of personal project management experience.

**Contact Hours of Project Management Instruction:** Minimum of 35 hours of specific instruction that addresses learning objectives in project management.

### Prerequisites for PRINCE2 Certification

**PRINCE2® Foundation:** There is no prerequisite for the PRINCE2® Foundation examination, however, basic project management knowledge would be advisable.

**PRINCE2® Practitioner**: Only those can appear for a Practitioner who has passed the PRINCE2 Foundation exam.

## Exam Format

### **PMP Exam**

The exam consists of 200 multiple choice questions written against the PMBOK specification, industry-agnostic international best practices, and the PMP Code of Ethics. This is a closed book exam which lasts for 4 hours. The PMP exam is based on the five *performance domains*:

- Initiating the project (13%)
- Planning the project (24%)
- Executing the project (31%)
- Monitoring and controlling the project (25%)
- Closing the project (7%)

Earned PMP certificate is valid only for 3 years and you need to earn 60 PDUs (Professional Development Units) within three years to maintain your certificate for another 3 years.

### PRINCE2 Exam

The **PRINCE2 Foundation** exam consists of 75 multiple choice questions which should be completed in 60 minutes. Out of the 75 questions, 5 are trial based questions and not counted during the scoring process. This is a closed book exam. Generally, this exam is taken on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day evening which is the last day of PRINCE2 Foundation training.

The **Practitioner exam** is an objective, scenario-based paper. There are 8 questions each worth 10 marks, making a total of 80 marks available. The pass mark is 55% (44 marks required to pass out of 80 available). This is an open book exam. Generally, this exam is taken after 1 week of PRINCE 2 Practitioner training.

The PRINCE2 Foundation certificate needs no renewal.

The PRINCE2 Practitioner certificate needs to be renewed every 5 years.
