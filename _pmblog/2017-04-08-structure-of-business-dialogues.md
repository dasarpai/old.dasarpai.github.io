## Conclusion

There are many other names and formats of talk. Next time when you open your mouth to speak something then ask yourself what are you doing? What is the purpose of this? If you keep points discussed in this article in your mind before speaking and while speaking then you can avoid lots of unnecessary confrontation, controversy, and fight with others and the results of the talk will be more fruitful. This is a very useful topic for everybody but super-useful for those who are in leadership positions in corporate, government, politics, society, etc. On such a wide topic this is very small content but I expect to keep the discussion on and learn more from other’s experiences.
