# PMI-ACP Vs. Scrum Master Certification

If you are looking for agile certification then a question may come to your mind which agile certification? There are many certification bodies and every certification body has 3-5 certifications based on the agile team role.

Knowledge of agile methods, collaboration skills, and flexibility to adapt the complexity are the **high demand skills** for managing projects. Now, you must be wondering which certification will help you in developing these skills. The most well-recognized and **popular agile certifications** are those developed by the PMI, Scrum Alliance, Scrum.org, and ScrumStudy. It is not necessary to earn all the certifications of all these organizations. Here, we are going to discuss only project management certifications of PMI, Scrum Alliance, Scrum.org, and ScrumStudy, so that based on your need you can make an informed decision to earn a valuable certificate for yourself.

## What is the difference between PMI-ACP and Scrum Master Certification?

The PMI Agile Certified Practitioner (PMI-ACP)® formally recognizes your knowledge of agile principles and your skill with agile techniques. It requires a certain amount of hands-on, practical experience using the Agile methodology. The PMI-ACP covers many approaches of agile such as Scrum, Kanban, Lean, extreme programming (XP), and test-driven development (TDD.) So it will increase your versatility, wherever your projects may take you. It also helps you in making decisions about a particular method or mix of practices from different methods required for your project based on the need.

Scrum is one of the many methods to manage agile projects. It is a management support method and does not include the detail of practices for development, testing, and requirement management. The primary focus of Scrum is on delivering the product in increments that satisfy customer requirements. To deliver the greatest amount of value in the shortest amount of time, Scrum promotes prioritization and Time-boxing over fixing the scope, cost, and schedule of a project. An important feature of Scrum is self-organization, which allows the individuals who are actually doing the work to estimate and take ownership of tasks.
