# ZED Best Practices Based on Version 2

## Introduction & Background

### Objective
**Adopt Best Practices Through ZED to be Competitive in Emerging Markets.**

### Make in India. 
### What is the meaning of Make in India for you?
- Made in India.
- Consumed in India and in International Market.
- Employment for Indian.
- Participation of Indian People in the Economy.
- Big MNC invest in India and collaborate with local vendors to make International Quality Products.

**To Make in India initiative successful the only way is for Indian MSMEs to contribute and become partners to Indian or International Manufacturers or Service providers.**

### How to Make Indian MSME Competitive?
- Reduce Operational Cost
- Improve Quality

### How to bring qualitative change in the Indian MSME 
The answer to this question is ZED.

### What is ZED
- Means - ZERO DEFECT ZERO EFFECT
- a unique & holistic Maturity Assessment Model for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs)
- Includes Assessment, Rating and Handholding
- Parameters in ZED model are related to production, design, quality, safety, environment, etc.

### MSME Champions
- Holistic Approach to **unify, synergize and converge** various schemes and Interventions with a single purpose. 
- The end objective is to pick up clusters and enterprises and 
	- modernize their processes, 
	- reduce wastage, 
	- sharpen business competitiveness and 
	- facilitate their National and Global reach and excellence.

### Six Components of MSME Tech Upgradation Scheme.
1. Zero Effect Zero Defect 
2. Lean Manufacturing Competitiveness Scheme 
3. Support for Entrepreneurial and Managerial Development of MSMEs through Incubators 
4. Building Awareness of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) 
5. Design Expertise in Manufacturing MSME sector 
6. Digital MSME Scheme. 

### What is needed to do these?
- Making MSME globally competitive in processes, technologies, and products
- Training, capacity building, certifications, and handholding

### Challenges
- These 6 schemes needed a different focus to integrate so that enterprises become competitive.
