# Behaviors that lead to Exceptional Performance

## Introdunction 

Achieving exceptional performance involves adopting key behaviors that can make one a go-getter while maintaining a happy personal life. This article draws inspiration from various sources, including books, articles, and personal experiences. What matters most is not how others perceive you, but how you see yourself and how consistently you exhibit these behaviors. You might not be a widely recognized personality, but knowing that you are peaceful, proactive, accommodating, and compassionate can lead to personal and professional fulfillment. I hope this summary will inspire you to live like an exceptional leader.

## 12 Behaviours

1. **Think Like a Leader**: Take responsibility for getting things done and see yourself as in charge. Don’t wait until the last minute; instead, monitor your projects and act proactively. Success depends not on the abilities of those around you, but on your skill in managing situations, people, and communication. A great leader can transform a mediocre performer into a valuable team member, while a poor leader can demoralize even the best worker.

2. **Manage Your Priorities**: List your tasks and evaluate each one’s importance and urgency. Use a simple matrix with two columns: Important and Urgent. Mark each task as Y (Yes) or N (No) in both columns. This will create four categories: Urgent-Important, Non-Urgent-Important, Urgent-Non-Important, and Non-Urgent-Non-Important. If multiple tasks fall into the same category, assign a priority to each. Start your day by tackling the top three tasks that are both urgent and important. If time is limited, delegate the remaining tasks to your team.

3. **Don’t Avoid Necessary Confrontation**: Avoid the temptation to always be the “nice guy” who avoids conflict. On the other hand, don’t engage in conflict without good reason. Understand the importance and urgency of issues, and stand up for your point of view when necessary.

4. **Check Your Ego at the Door**: Keep your ego out of the workplace. Be clear and assertive about your points, but don’t take things personally or become overly emotional. Even if you are in a junior position, bringing ego into work can harm both the environment and your own growth.

5. **Think for Yourself**: Regularly review the progress of your projects and assess your behavior and attitude toward your colleagues and work. Self-awareness is key to continuous improvement.

6. **Seek Guidance When Needed**: If you encounter difficulties, consult the organization’s library or knowledge base first. If that doesn’t help, discuss the issue with a trusted colleague or professional friend. If further help is needed, look to industry best practices or consult your immediate supervisor. If your supervisor is approachable, they can be a valuable second line of support.

7. **Embrace Integrity in All That You Do**: In every decision, listen to your inner voice and align your actions with it. Integrity is essential, especially when dealing with complex situations where conventional wisdom may not apply. Trust your inner guidance to make sound decisions.

8. **You Cannot Please Everyone**: As someone wisely said, "I don't know the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to please everyone." Recognize that while people may have valid points, it's impossible to implement everyone's suggestions.

9. **Live in the Present Moment**: Accept failures, learn from them, and move forward. Terms like “if,” “but,” “would,” and “should” are useful for analysis and reflection, but they shouldn't dominate your thinking. Focus on the present and what you can do now.

10. **Define Who You Choose to Be**: Establish your personal brand and actively work to embody it. This helps create a distinct identity and guides your actions and decisions.

11. **Treat Others as You Would Like to Be Treated**: In the long run, your impact on others matters more than specific successes or failures. Be fair and respectful in all your interactions. Remember, someone is always observing your behavior.

12. **Maintain a Healthy Lifestyle**: Consume food and drinks that keep your body and mind active, light, and agile. A healthy lifestyle supports sustained high performance.
