# Book: Mindful Projet Management
## Voyage of a Project Manager

[Kindle Read](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B0CQ37294Y)

In our modern era, a tragic trend has emerged where humans are growing increasingly desensitized and losing their inclination for deeper thought. We reside in an age of abundant information and rapidity, yet we struggle to derive meaning from this wealth of data, failing to assess the value in our pursuits and objectives. We live mechanically, skimming through endless information, social media platforms, and journeys without purposeful contemplation. We traverse through life's milestones—education, career, marriage, wealth acquisition—unmindfully, forgetting our potential for a more purposeful existence. As the most intelligent beings known to the cosmos, we have the power to imbue life's events with significance. After engaging with this book, your surroundings may remain unchanged, but a shift in your thought patterns can revolutionize your world, and this transformation can extend its value to others.

The narratives within these pages are rooted in reality. To ensure its accessibility to a diverse audience, I've tailored some accounts by adjusting their sequences and numbers. This book aims to empower professionals to extract meaningful insights even from seemingly trivial occurrences, urging us all to lead a more conscious life. My hope is that this reading inspires you to imbue every life event with significance. Whether we consider ourselves ordinary students or astute observers, the nature, our surroundings, and the cosmos continuously impart lessons. It is our responsibility to invest the time to experience and interpret these teachings within the fabric of our lives.

This self-help book caters to the realm of project leadership while steering readers toward a thoughtful approach to project management. Project management, as a profession, encapsulates diverse elements such as scope, schedule, cost, risk, quality, resources, stakeholders, and time-bound objectives aimed at instigating change sponsored by the project. Consequently, I employ project management terminology, often assigning different meanings compared to their conventional usage. If you possess some background in project management, certain terms may be familiar as they exist within this domain. I endeavor to define pertinent terms whenever they are referenced to ensure clarity and understanding.

## Kindle Book Review

### Indeed a Self

Hari's "Mindful Project Management: Voyage of a Project Manager" is a literary gem that seamlessly weaves together the realms of project leadership, materialistic insights, and spiritual wisdom. This review delves into the transformative journey that Hari presents, offering readers a unique dual lens through the eyes of a seeker, combining the pragmatic lens of Project Management with the profound philosophy of Advaita or non-duality.

Journey of a Seeker:
Hari's narrative skillfully embodies the essence of a seeker, someone who keenly observes and learns from every experience. The brilliance lies in the dual perspectives - the materialistic lens of Project Management and the spiritual lens of Advaita Philosophy, or simply "Being Human". The harmonious integration of these two perspectives creates a beautifully nuanced narrative that imparts both practical and profound insights.

Universal Applicability:
The book transcends its specific focus on project management by prompting readers to apply the dual lenses of materialism and spirituality to their own lives. Each chapter serves as a rich experience shared by Hari, offering readers the chance to learn not only from his experiences but also to view life through his unique perspectives. It's a masterclass in learning from the mistakes of others and applying these lessons to one's own journey.

Interactive Learning:
A commendable aspect of the book is Hari's encouragement for readers to note down their learnings after each chapter. This simple yet powerful practice instills a proactive approach towards life. The author provides a valuable nugget by fostering a habit of observation, thoughtful introspection, and active learning—a habit that extends far beyond the boundaries of project management, enriching the reader's entire life journey.

Deceptively Simple, Profoundly Wise:
The stories shared by Hari may seem simple and rooted in daily experiences, but the depth of thought and introspection they carry showcases the author's profound understanding. Despite his impressive qualifications, Hari humbly opens up his life to share invaluable lessons. This selflessness and authenticity contribute to the creation of a true self-help book, making it an invaluable resource for readers on their seeking and learning journey.

In Conclusion:
"Mindful Project Management" is a masterpiece that combines the practical and the profound, the materialistic and the spiritual. Hari's ability to communicate complex ideas with simplicity, coupled with the interactive learning approach, makes this book a treasure trove of wisdom. It is not just a guide for project managers but a compass for seekers navigating the intricate journey of life. Three cheers to Hari for this remarkable work—a beacon of light in the realm of self-help literature.
