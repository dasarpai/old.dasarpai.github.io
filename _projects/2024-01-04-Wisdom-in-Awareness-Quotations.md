Human mind works best with sound, images, and smell. In the animal kingdom we are not among the strongest species. Yet we are thriving on this planet. In comparison to other animals of planet earth, our brain has evolved to the extreme. We can reason, imagine, remember many things, remember for a very long time, and we have intuition and telepathy. These capabilities came to us over millions of years of evolutionary process. Reading and writing characters, words, sentences is the latest capability in this evolutionary process. That is why every human knows how to use sounds, images, and smell for signaling and survival but many of us don't know how to read letters of a single language. Reading words, sentences and books is painful for them. But there are some who can speak, read and write poetry and philosophy in multiple languages. 

We know a picture can speak a thousand words but many of us cannot draw a circle or straight line correctly. But, this is about writing. There are many people who can read but cannot write. There are a few who can write and read in multiple languages. Even if you can write and draw, you know writing is easy compared to drawing, unless you are a wizard of painting and drawing.

Even if writing is easy compared to drawing, many people cannot even write. Reading a complex image is easy for many people rather than reading a paragraph. This is the reason compressing information in lesser words is important. But, in this process essense of the text should not be dropped or misrepresented. Quotations are the way to compress that information.

Wisdom is quintessential things which we develop within us, after listening, reading, observing, experimenting, and experiencing. Every human has some wisdom. When we want to share that wisdom, we take the help of letters, words, grammar, script, sound of any language and script. We can also take help of drawing. What we write or draw or speak is information for others. Whether it will become a listener's or readerâ€™s wisdom or not, it depends upon them. Before that information becomes wisdom for them it becomes knowledge for them.

I was fond of so-called one line wisdom quotations. Over the period of time I realized this has the following problems. 
"Wisdom Quotation" for speaker or writer is packed information for the readers, it is not wisdom for listeners and readers. 
Many times these quotations are trying to play with words and acronyms. Life is more than those words or acronyms of any language. Word play can help in memorization but it is not helpful in living a wise life.
These quotations are trying to solace us or divert our mind to positive thinking but life is throwing some different stuff at the readers. Therefore the readers are able to memorize those short phrases but not able to handle them or apply them. 
Human life needs help in asking deeper questions rather than memorizing the answers. But these quotations are trying to answer many of our life problems. Therefore for the short term it okey, but in long you become a person of words not person of wisdom.
People want to use templates for everything, even for the life they are looking for a template. Using a template with least mental and cognitive burden you can solve a problem quickly. But we know these templates don't work when we try to apply them in our life. No matter how many templates you try, your solution will come from your own deeper questions and thinking. Templates can help but ultimately only a thinking mind can endure or come out of the problem. Other people get crushed or keep crying or hoping or blaming.

Keeping this all in mind, I wrote this book. In general, quotations or passages or paragraphs in this book are longer than normal quotations. The nature of the quotations in the book is different, they are provocative, force you to think, challenge the conventional way, and encourage readers to find a new way to come out of that mindset which has made you stuck in the web of words. 

99% of the quotations in this book are coming from my reflections and meditative mood. Some of the quotations of other philosophers and thinkers have been used here, names of those are written below the respective quotations. I was writing these quotations on my quotation blog for a long period of time under my pen name "Advaitananda". I have selected some of the quotations from there creating this, compiling them here in this book.

When there are two there is a relationship. A relationship of dependent and dependee. There is expectation in the relationship. When there is only one then all the relationship and expectations fades away. Life comes to the center. Advaita is a Sanskrit word, it means not two. Advaitananda means one who is established in the bliss of the Self.
