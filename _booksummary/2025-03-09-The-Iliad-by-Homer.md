# **Summary of *The Iliad***  

The Iliad was written by Homer, an ancient Greek poet. The Iliad is a long epic poem written in 24 books (sections). It contains over 15,000 lines of verse in dactylic hexameter (a rhythmic style of poetry). Originally, it was recited or sung by bards before being written down. The Trojan War (c. 1200 BCE) may have happened, but we have no solid proof. Archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann discovered ruins in Troy (modern-day Turkey) in the 19th century, suggesting a war-like event occurred.

*The Iliad* is not just about war—it’s about **human emotions, honor, fate, and the choices we make**. It remains one of the greatest epics ever written of the West! 

**Time & Setting:**  
- Takes place during the **Trojan War** (a legendary conflict between the Greeks and Trojans).  
- Focuses on a few weeks in the **final year** of the war.  

**Main Characters:**  
- **Achilles** 🏹 – The greatest Greek warrior, known for his strength and pride.  
- **Agamemnon** 👑 – The Greek king and leader of the army.  
- **Hector** ⚔️ – The noble Trojan prince and strongest warrior of Troy.  
- **Paris** 🏛️ – A Trojan prince who started the war by taking Helen.  
- **Helen** 👩‍🦰 – The most beautiful woman, whose abduction (or elopement) caused the war.  
- **Priam** 👑 – King of Troy and father of Hector and Paris.  
- **The Gods** 🏛️ – Greek gods constantly interfere in human affairs (Zeus, Athena, Apollo, etc.).  

## 🔥 **Key Events in *The Iliad***  
1️⃣ **Achilles vs. Agamemnon** – Achilles is insulted when Agamemnon takes his war prize (a woman named Briseis), so he refuses to fight for the Greeks.  

2️⃣ **Hector’s Heroism** – Hector leads the Trojan army and proves himself as Troy’s strongest warrior.  

3️⃣ **Patroclus’ Death** – Achilles’ close friend **Patroclus** is killed by Hector while wearing Achilles’ armor.  

4️⃣ **Achilles’ Rage & Revenge** – Enraged, Achilles returns to battle, kills Hector, and drags his body behind his chariot in anger.  

5️⃣ **Priam’s Plea** – King Priam bravely sneaks into the Greek camp and **begs Achilles** for his son Hector’s body. Achilles, moved by Priam’s grief, finally shows mercy and returns Hector’s body.  

📌 **Ending:** *The Iliad* ends with Hector’s funeral. The fall of Troy (the famous Trojan Horse) is not part of *The Iliad* but comes later in Greek mythology.
