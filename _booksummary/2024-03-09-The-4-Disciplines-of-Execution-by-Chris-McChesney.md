# The 4 Disciplines of Execution

Achieving Your Wildly Important Goals by Chris McChesney, Sean Covey, et al.:

Here are 10 key lessons from the book:

1. Focus on the Wildly Important Goals (WIGS). Identify a small number of truly critical goals that will have a significant impact on your organization's success.
2. Act on Lead Measures. Focus on leading indicators that predict future performance, rather than lagging indicators that measure past results.
3. Keep a Compelling Scoreboard. Create a visible and accessible scoreboard that tracks progress towards WIGs. Use the scoreboard to foster accountability and engagement.
4. Create a Cadence of Accountability. Establish regular meetings and communication channels to review progress, address challenges, and maintain alignment.
5. Break down WIGs into manageable steps. Create a clear and actionable plan for achieving each WIG. Break down the plan into smaller, achievable steps with defined deadlines.
6. Assign clear ownership and accountability. Clearly assign ownership and accountability for each step in the plan. Ensure everyone understands their role and responsibilities.
7. Track progress regularly and consistently. Monitor progress on a regular basis and make adjustments as needed. Use data and insights from the scoreboard to inform decisions.
8. Address challenges promptly and effectively. Don't let obstacles derail progress. Identify challenges early, analyze the root causes, and implement solutions promptly.
9. Celebrate successes and recognize contributions. Acknowledge and celebrate achievements along the way. Recognize the contributions of individuals and teams to maintain motivation.
10. Foster a culture of accountability. Create an environment where everyone feels responsible for their actions and contributions. Encourage open communication and feedback.
