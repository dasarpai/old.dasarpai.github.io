# System Patterns

## System Architecture

*   **Static Site:** The core architecture is a static website generated by Jekyll.
*   **Hosting:** Hosted on GitHub Pages, leveraging its built-in Jekyll processing and CDN.
*   **Content Management:** Content is managed through Markdown files stored in a Git repository.
*   **Build Process:** GitHub Pages automatically runs `jekyll build` on push (or potentially via a custom GitHub Action defined in `.github/workflows/` if present - *needs verification*).
*   **Dependencies:** Ruby (for Jekyll and plugins), potentially Node.js (if using tools like Webpack via `package.json`).

## Key Technical Decisions

*   **Jekyll:** Chosen as the static site generator.
*   **GitHub Pages:** Selected for hosting due to its simplicity and integration with GitHub.
*   **Markdown:** Used as the primary format for writing content.
*   **Theme:** (Need to identify the specific Jekyll theme being used by inspecting `_config.yml` or theme files).

## Design Patterns in Use

*   **Collections:** Jekyll collections (`_dsblog`, `_booksummary`, etc.) are used to organize different types of content.
*   **Layouts & Includes:** Standard Jekyll patterns for templating (`_layouts/`, `_includes/`).
*   **Data Files:** Configuration and reusable data stored in `_data/` (e.g., `authors.yml`, `navigation.yml`).
*   **Front Matter:** YAML front matter in Markdown files provides metadata (title, date, layout, categories, tags).

## Component Relationships

*   **Content Files (`_posts`, Collections):** Contain the raw text and metadata.
*   **Layouts (`_layouts`):** Define the overall HTML structure for different page types.
*   **Includes (`_includes`):** Reusable snippets of HTML/Liquid code (e.g., header, footer, sidebar).
*   **Data Files (`_data`):** Provide structured data accessible within templates.
*   **Configuration (`_config.yml`):** Global settings for Jekyll and the site.
*   **Assets (`assets/`):** CSS, JavaScript, images, and other static files.

## Critical Implementation Paths

*   **Content Creation:** Add new Markdown file to the appropriate collection -> Add YAML front matter -> Write content -> Commit & Push.
*   **Theme Customization:** Modify files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass`, `assets/`.
*   **Configuration Changes:** Edit `_config.yml`.
*   **Dependency Updates:** Modify `Gemfile` (Ruby) or `package.json` (Node) and run appropriate install commands (`bundle install`, `npm install`).
