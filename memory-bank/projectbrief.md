# Project Brief

## Core Requirements & Goals

*   **Project Name:** dasarpai.github.io (GitHub Pages Blog)
*   **Primary Goal:** Maintain and enhance a personal blog hosted on GitHub Pages using Jekyll.
*   **Key Objectives:**
    *   Publish blog posts on various topics (Data Science, AI, Book Summaries, Management, etc.).
    *   Organize content effectively using categories and tags.
    *   Ensure the site is functional, performant, and easy to navigate.
    *   Manage project dependencies and configurations.
    *   Implement improvements and new features as requested.
    *   Maintain a Memory Bank for project context and continuity.

## Scope

*   Static site generation and deployment via GitHub Pages.
*   Troubleshooting build issues and site errors.
*   Implementing user-requested features or changes.
*   Maintaining the Memory Bank documentation.
