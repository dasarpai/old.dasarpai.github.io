# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

This project serves as a personal knowledge base and blog for the user, hosted publicly via GitHub Pages. It allows the user to:

*   Share insights, summaries, and resources on topics they are interested in (Data Science, AI, Books, Management, Philosophy, etc.).
*   Organize their learning and thoughts in a structured manner.
*   Build an online presence and portfolio of their interests and expertise.
*   Experiment with Jekyll and web technologies.

## Problems It Solves

*   Provides a centralized platform for the user's diverse writings and summaries.
*   Makes the user's content accessible to a wider audience.
*   Offers a simple, static-site-based solution for blogging, minimizing hosting complexity and cost.
*   Facilitates easy content creation and updates using Markdown.

## How It Should Work

*   **Content:** The site displays blog posts, book summaries, and potentially other content types organized chronologically and by category/tag.
*   **Navigation:** Users should be able to easily browse content through menus, category/tag links, and potentially search (if implemented).
*   **Technology:** It's built with Jekyll, a static site generator. Content is written in Markdown, processed by Jekyll using themes and layouts, and served as static HTML, CSS, and JS files by GitHub Pages.
*   **Workflow:** The user writes content in Markdown files within specific collection directories (e.g., `_dsblog`, `_booksummary`). Committing changes to the GitHub repository triggers a build and deployment process via GitHub Actions or native GitHub Pages integration.

## User Experience Goals

*   **Readability:** Content should be well-formatted and easy to read on various devices.
*   **Navigability:** Finding specific posts or topics should be intuitive.
*   **Performance:** The site should load quickly, leveraging the benefits of a static site architecture.
*   **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent look and feel across the site based on the chosen Jekyll theme.
