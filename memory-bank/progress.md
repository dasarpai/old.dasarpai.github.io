# Progress

## What Works

*   **Core Jekyll Site:** The basic Jekyll site structure appears to be in place.
*   **Content Collections:** Multiple collections (`_dsblog`, `_booksummary`, etc.) exist for organizing content.
*   **GitHub Pages Hosting:** The site is configured for deployment on GitHub Pages (implied by `dasarpai.github.io` name and common practices).
*   **Memory Bank:** Initial structure created.

## What's Left to Build / Improve

*   **Verification:** Need to verify specific configurations:
    *   Jekyll theme being used.
    *   Ruby/Jekyll versions.
    *   Build process (GitHub Pages default vs. Actions).
    *   Status and configuration of Staticman, Netlify, Travis CI integrations.
    *   Presence and usage of Node.js/npm (`package.json`).
*   **Content Population:** Memory Bank files need further population based on deeper analysis or user input.
*   **Potential Issues:** Address any build errors, broken links, or rendering issues on the live site (if any).
*   **Future Features:** Implement any user-requested enhancements or new features.

## Current Status

*   Memory Bank initialization is in progress. Core files have been created with baseline content derived from initial project structure analysis.
*   The project itself (the blog) is pre-existing. Its exact operational status needs review.

## Known Issues

*   None identified yet, pending further investigation and testing.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   (To be documented as changes are made or historical decisions are uncovered)
