# नासदीय सूक्तं 
## Nasadiya Sukta

### Nasadiya Sukta from RigVeda

In English we can call it Hymn of Creation. This is part of 10th mandala of the Rigveda (10:129). It is contemplating on the cosmology and the origin of the universe. This is one of the oldest text from Bhartiya Rishis. It has only 7 slokas and it goes like following.

नासदासीन्नो सदासीत्तदानीं नासीद्रजो नो व्योमा परो यत् ।  
किमावरीवः कुह कस्य शर्मन्नम्भः किमासीद्गहनं गभीरम् ॥1॥  
There was NO existence then , nor was non-existence.  
No realm of air yet, nor there was aakasha beyond.  
What cloaked all and where and by whose Maya?  
Did not the cosmic waters pervade dark and deep !.  


न मृत्युरासीदमृतं न तर्हि न रात्र्या अह्न आसीत्प्रकेतः ।  
आनीदवातं स्वधया तदेकं तस्माद्धान्यन्न परः किं चनास ॥2॥  
There was no cycle of birth or decay  
Nor there was a mediator for darkness and light  
The field of consciousness breathed, the field is self-sustaining.  
Apart from morphogenetic Brahman, there was none!!  


तम आसीत् तमसा गूळमग्रेऽप्रकेतं सलिलं सर्वमाइदम्  
तुच्येनाभ्वपिहितं यदासीत् तपसस्तन्महिनाजायतैकम् || 3 ||  
The Dark energy concealed in darkness, a continuum of dark cosmic ocean  
Then “That”, which lay in void thus covered, burst forth in the glory self excited by intent  


कामस्तदग्रॆ समवर्तताधि मनसॊ रॆत: प्रथमं यदासीत् ।  
सतॊबन्धुमसति निरविन्दन्हृदि प्रतीष्या कवयॊ मनीषा ॥4॥  
In that great cosmic all pervading mind  
A vibrations of Kama sprout from a conscious thought  
The seers, who have searched within with the wisdom,  
Have witnessed the conscious equation between matter and energy  
तिरश्चीनो विततो रश्मिरेषामधः स्विदासी दुपरिस्विदासी  
रेतोधाआसन् महिमान आसन् स्वधा अवस्तात् प्रयतिः परस्तात् || 5 ||  
An oblique ray cutting the Being from the Non-being on the screen.  
What was described above, and what described below this screen?  

Above was the power of conscious intent and  
Below was the strength of creative discipline  
को अद्धा वेद क इह प्र वोचत् कुत आजाता कुत इयंविसृष्टिः  
अर्वाग् देवा अस्य विसर्जनेनाथा को वेद यतआबभूव || 6 ||  
Who really knows? Who in this world may declare it!  
When was this holographic exhalation, whence will be the pralaya inhalation?  
Only after this holographic projection came the gods of the field  
Who move nature’s opposites. Who truly can say this!  


इयं विसृष्टिर्यत आबभूव यदि वा दधे यदि वा न  
यो अस्याध्यक्षः परमे व्योमन् सो अङ्ग वेद यदि वा नवेद || 7 ||  
He, from whom this creation arose,  
He may hold the reins, or he may not  
He, who surveys it all from his highest plane,  
He verily knows it, or perhaps even he does not?  
Mind-blowing! Isn’t it? This text is many thousands of years old.  
Leave aside the common man of 21st Century, even so-called intellectual,  
philosophers, scientists struggle hard to think like this.

So think whether we are going forward, or reverse or  
moving on endless circle because since last  
many centuries we couldn’t produce enough  
minds of this kind which we had many millennia ago.

Hari Om Tat Sat
