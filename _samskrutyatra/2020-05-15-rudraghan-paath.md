In Vedic system to chant a mantra following methods are used. It makes sure correct memorization and ensures if there is an error you can catch that. So, in Guru Shishya Parampara long down the line, it is not possible that someone plays and changes the main sloka, because doing so means changing various kind of Patha of that sloka. It has inbuilt checksum system.
