Sharma can PTM be saved it's India's digital payments giant a household name with
tens of millions of users it's on the verge of losing its license the story has been brewing for a few days now the
company bosses are running from Pillar To Post to contain the crisis but it looks tough tonight we'll put together
the developments in the reports to try to answer one question can PTM be saved
our next story is from Pakistan tomorrow is election day we already know who's winning it's a sham that the world
cannot ignore though tonight we'll talk about what India should expect from this election in Pakistan in Myanmar The
Crisis escalates India has issued an alert all Indian citizens must leave the
latest tech company to announce layoffs is snap the parent company of Snapchat caught in a downward spiral we'll
discuss that in the US the Border has become the biggest election issue it seems and Donald Trump and Joe Biden
seem to have the same solution with different names in Europe Farmers have one concession after weeks of protests
in China travel chaos due to extreme weather in Sri Lanka the killing of elephants has sparked concern also
report and how influences are reaching your children and giving them dangerous advice and how the Sun is flipping poles
what does it mean and why should you care all that and more coming up the headlines first tensions continue in West Asia
Iran launches three satellit simultaneously for the first time in Jerusalem US Secretary of State Anthony
blinkin meets Israeli Prime Minister Nathan yahu this comes as Israel and Hamas we a truce proposal Saudi Arabia
says no ties with Israel without an independent Palestinian State another Indian origin student
killed in the US this is the fifth such incident in a month 23-year-old Samir Kat was studying at the pur University
in Indiana just last week Neil achara a student from the same University was also found
dead big embarrassment for Nikki Haley no one won the Republican Party primary
in Nevada Haley who was unopposed was beaten by none of these candidates she
lost to Trump in Iowa and New Hampshire and is likely to lose in a home state of South Carolina later this
month China removes the head of its top Financial regulator the surprise move comes amid sharp sell-offs in the
country's stock markets China is the world's second largest economy in recent months it has been among the worst
performing Nations globally and unlike Hong Kong Messi doesn't
disappoint Tokyo he takes the field in the second half of inter Miami's friendly a few days back the Argentine
Superstar was a noow in Hong Kong angering fans
there our lead story tonight is PTM until a week ago it was a celebrated unicorn today it's a company struggling
to survive PM is in deep trouble last week India Central Bank issued an
order against it it's called The RBI The Reserve Bank of India and its order came
like a death sentence Banning PTM from most banking services the order comes
into effect in March so the company's working overtime to save itself and that is the big question right now can PTM be
saved the deadline is February 29th so barely 3 weeks to go there's a lot of
speculation talk of a potential sale Reports say PTM may sell a part of the business and that there are two sutors
in the free HDFC bank and Geo Financial Services now none of this is confirmed right now but even if a sale is proposed
they will need the rbi's permission a sale cannot go through without a nod from the central bank and whichever way
it goes the Fallout will be immense this is a big company we're talking about PTM
is a major player in financial services a poster child of India's digital payments Revolution it has more than 300
million active users all of them will be affected by the rbi's order BM is
scrambling to protect its business and to reassure its customers it says its services will continue
uninterrupted and that it's working with the Reserve Bank trying to address the concerns and mitigate the crisis The
Reserve Bank says PTM is not playing by the rules and that it committed serious
compliance violations so can the company still be saved at this point a comeback looks
tough Reports say The Reserve Bank May cancel its license a final call is yet
to be taken but officials are said to be seriously considering this the company's founder is Vijay shakar Sharma he met
with officials from the Central Bank apparently seeking some concessions either an extension of the deadline or
assistance in keeping PM's operations safe what does that mean patm is looking
to migrate some of its accounts to other Banks this is to keep the service online
for its customers now both these options were discussed with the Reserve Bank officials and what was their response a
flat denial so the Feb 29 deadline stays and the RBI will not offer any assistance to
patm the company is on its own really the central bank will not nudge any banks to take this
up in fact it may move in the opposite direction shutting doors for PTM Reports
say the RBI has refused to entertain any request from the company and they're unlikely to meet Vijay shakar Sharma
again it's a very tough approach yes and there's the reason for this The Reserve Bank believes that PTM was given enough
time a lot of leeway to address compliance issues and now the bank seems to have
run out of patience but the PM founder is not giving up yesterday Vijay shakar Sharma met with India's Finance Minister
nirmala sitaraman we don't know what was discussed but by all accounts he sought some
relief and this was most likely a person appeal to the Finance Minister we'll have to wait and see if it helped now
PM's problems circle around a subsidiary it's called the PTM payments
Bank this subsidiary is at the heart of the payments business it has a license from the
Reserve Bank but it's not a full banking license so this company can take
deposits but it cannot lend money it offers services like digital banking
fixed deposits through partners Banks digital wallets and payments UPI which is India's realtime payment system and
fast tag which is India's electronic toll collection system all these services are run by the PTM payments
Bank its parent companies called 197 Communications they to offer banking
services through various Arrangements but the rbi's order specifically Target the subsidiary the PTM payments bank
that's the target will selling the subsidiary help them is is that the only
way out for PTM well a distress sale is an option but it's a very tough one it would be
like cutting the arm to save the body The Last of The Last Resorts will PM do it the next few days
would determine the future of this

it's voting time in Pakistan just hours from now polls will open across the country some 5,000 candidates are in the
frey they're fighting for 266 seats but not a lot of excitement on the ground
because most pakistanis have lost faith in the election they know what to expect a lot of rigging a lot of military
meddling and finally a selected government this time it's Naas sharif's
turn the Army is backing him to be prime minister again so it's a foregone conclusion yet the world will be
watching because this is a nuclear armed State also the global headquarters of terrorism a national election here will
have implications for the region and the world voting will Begin by 8:00 a.m.
local time it will continue until 5:00 p.m. if voters are in line by then they
can vote a big challenge will be security almost half of all polling stations have been declared sensitive
there is extra security there and with good reason on Tuesday multiple incidents were reported in bistan around
nine grenade attacks in one day and the targets election offices and polling
stations such incidents could keep voters away tomorrow and fewer voters
equals more rigging we've discussed the issues and faces of this election on the show tonight let's talk about the
expectations they're very low of course both at home and outside take India for instance how should India see this
election in Pakistan what does each candidate bring to the table for India we'll start with Naas Sharif he's
a known figure in New Delhi a three-time former prime minister his last term was from 20 2013 to 20177 meaning he has
worked with prime minister Narendra Modi the two leaders had a warm equation and now we come to the policies
Sharif is a pro Western politician between the United States and Pakistan he has closed ties with the United
States in the past he has advocated for fixing relations with India in fact
Sharif presided over the Delhi lore bus diplomacy he came to India for prime
minister modi's Inauguration in 2014 and recently he has been talking about a
reset no country can progress while fighting with its
neighbors so is there a reason to Hope well Sharif St record offers some
confidence if anyone is likely to push for a reset it is nawas Sharif his
Manifesto talks about a message of peace to India then you have bilaval BTO
zardari leader of the Pakistan People's Party India knows knows a lot about the bhos they are political royalty in
Pakistan but belaval is the new kid on the Block in the last few years he served as Pakistan's foreign minister so
chances are India got a good look at him and The Impressions can't have been good while
in the US Bela said some nasty things about the Indian Prime Minister AMA bin
ladin is dead but the Butcher of Gujarat lives and he is the prime minister of
India poor MO for a top Diplomat it shows that he lacks maturity and
experience will baval BTO be any different as prime minister it's tough
to say he's talked about ending the politics of hate and revenge I guess that applies to foreign policy as well
at the same time he keeps making those nasty attacks last year in August he did the same he said Prime Minister Modi
will become the Butcher of Kashmir also forward to the it's not the temperament of a Statesman and finally we have Imran
Khan his term as prime minister was mixed bag you did have a few breakthroughs like the Visa free karur
Corridor it allowed Indian seeks to visit a shrine in Pakistan without Visa
Prime Minister Modi publicly thanked Imran Khan for it in 2021 India and Pakistan also renewed a Seas fire again
Imran Khan was prime minister then but honestly the bad outweighs the good Imran Khan made a habit of raising
Kashmir at the United Nations he branded the Indian government fascist I want to
make it clear that any attempt by the fascist
totalitarian RSS L Indian government to aggress against
Pakistan will be met by a nation that that will fight for its freedom to the
end the pulama attack also happened under him 40 Indian Personnel were killed so another Imran Khan term is not
really encouraging and not like it matters you and I have a better chance of becoming prime minister than Imran
Khan at best his party can make inroads so my point is don't expect very much Pakistani
politicians can have the best of intentions but in the end only the Army matters if General Asim munir wants a
reset it may happen and if he does this is the right time General munir took
charge as Army Chief in November 2022 so he's got a long term ahead of him India
too will have elections this year all bets are on Prime Minister Modi to continue in office so there is time and
Circumstance Pakistan's economy is struggling to stay afloat more cooperation with the fifth largest
economy in the world is only going to help them it would also free up his plate maybe more time to focus on his
other borders the borders with Iran and Afghanistan both have flared up recently
so Asim munir will be looking to stabilize things there India of course will want results we have heard Promises
of Peace before what New Delhi wants is Action Now visible and strong Action Against Terror groups that's the only
reason why these elections are key because it could be a clean
slate not because it's a democratic exercise because let's face it big boss has more democracy than this
sham onto another Indian neighbor that is Myanmar it's been gripped by a civil war since late last year but now New
Delhi is worried the government of India has released an advisory they're first
since violence broke out and what does it say leave rakine State immediately if
you're planning to travel there do not if you're already there leave that's the message from New Delhi some context now
rakine is a state in Myanmar it is located along the western coast of the country it is close to but does not
border India you may have heard of this region before it was home to the rohinga
Muslims they were driven out by the Myan AR Army but now the roles have changed
the Army is the one being hunted by whom the arakan Army they're part of the
ethnic Coalition against the hun it's called the three Brotherhood Alliance
the ethnic Coalition and the arakan Army is fierce they've made major gains since
last year a number of outposts have been captured a few cities have changed hands even military installations have fallen
the arakan Army says they've captured two hun Battalion headquarters in just
the last last week two in one week in fact H soldiers are on the run some 260
of them fled to Bangladesh recently so the rakine state is a battlefield and things could get even more ugly there
which is why India has issued this advisory but will that alone be enough I ask because the fighting is spreading
it's not just limited to rakine violence has been reported in the Shan State as well in the chin
state in Cari and and the saging state so it's
all over Myanmar really Western countries have started to take notice they're asking the Hun to stop the
violence we strongly condemn the ongoing violence harming civilians including the
military's continued use of indiscriminate air strikes we Echo the
call of asan in urging the Myanmar armed forces in particular to cease its
attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure India too is concerned
New Delhi has not openly criticized the Hun but it has called for the violence to end U I would like to say that we are
concerned with the deteriorating situation in Myanmar which has direct
implications for us as a neighboring country and friend of Myanmar India has been long advocating
for complete sucession of violence and myanmar's transition towards inclusive
Federal democracy well that was last week and now an advisory is out India is
not just looking at the current crisis it is also looking at a long-term solution and what is that a border fence
it could be a controversial decision India's home minister made the announcement on Tuesday he said the
entire border with Myanmar will be fenced plus a patrol track will be
constructed the idea is to constantly monitor the border now the need for
fense is understandable some 5,000 Myanmar refugees have entered India since last year dozens of soldiers have
also fled here and in the current context it is worrying India's Manipur state shares a border with Myanmar and
right now Manipur is in the middle of a crisis two ethnic groups are fighting there so the last thing you want is
outside influence making things worse in fact the Manipur chief minister has openly called for offense but others are
not so Keen the chief Ministers of nagaland and mizoram have opposed it and
why is that because of local sentiments Indian border communities have families on the other side in Myanmar right now
they can travel across and meet them few checks no hassles but a border fence is
going to change all of that it would make travel more difficult hence the opposition of course the final
decision lies with the center so looks like the fence will be built it may
limit India's exposure to those to the Civil War in Myanmar but it's not a complete solution for that the fighting needs to
end but will the Hun agree to that they're getting more desperate for sure
on Monday a school in southern Myanmar was flattened by air strikes at least four children were killed around 15
others were injured now the Hun has not claimed responsibility yet but air strikes are their M Mo their modus
operandi eyewitnesses spotted fighter jets flying over the region only the Hun operate those the
rebels mostly use homemade drones so chances are this was the Hun and imagine
striking a school you do that when you're desperate when you want to frighten your
enemies so this war is not over yet the rebels may have made gains on the ground but the Hun controls the skies things
could get worse before they get
better meanwhile the turmoil in the tech sector continues company after company is reporting layoffs and a decline in
Revenue the latest one is snap the parent company of Snapchat snap has
reported fresh losses in the last quarter it lost some 248 million and the
markets have reacted sharply snap stock has fallen by 30% after the results what explains this a challenging
market and their revenue is falling how does a company make money mainly through
ad advertising revenue on the Snapchat app but the ad Market has been shrinking because economies are slowing down so
companies are spending Less on ads and snap has been losing money although that's not their only
problem they're also losing users the Snapchat app is not as popular as it used to be it is losing the race against
big tech companies last year Snapchat had more than 750 million users their
closest rival is Facebook do you know how many users Facebook has close to 3 billion so 750 million versus 3 billion
there is no comparison but there was a time when Snapchat was very popular especially among the teams its biggest
USB was the disappearing messages users used to communicate through pictures or snaps and once they were opened they
disappeared there was no way to retrieve them they were deleted immediately and automatically this feature made Snapchat
a rage the company also had a reputation for being an innovator others followed it players like meta frequently ripped
off Snapchat's features meta of course is a parent company of Facebook it run apps like Facebook and Instagram you may
have used these face filters Snapchat was the first one to ship them the other
simply copied in fact Instagram's founder one of the co-founders had even
admitted to this they said they're stealing features from
Snapchat so it seemed snap was on top of the curve then what went wrong according to
experts snap is not falling behind when it comes to Innovation what what it lacks is a steady business model they're
not being able to scale it they're failing to expand beyond the Snapchat app a few years ago they launched AR
glasses AR is augmented reality the project failed to take off it was scrapped soon after the launch next they
came up with a selfie drone did not work meanwhile they're also working on the app Snapchat they're making changes to
the product developing new features and opening up new revenue streams but they have a long way to go
snap CEO is a man called even Spiegel he says the company is focusing on quote unquote long-term growth and in the
short term they're taking some tough calls this week's snap announced layoffs they've cut 10% of their Global
Workforce that's more than 500 workers they've been asked to go and this is snap's thirdd round of layoffs in
2022 they cut around, 1300 jobs in 2023
they sagged around 70 people and 2024 has begun with another 500 employees
getting the pink slip to be fair this is the story across the tech sector it is witnessing a Slowdown everyone is
announcing Mass layoffs so far in 2024 more than 100 companies have laid off
over 30,000 employees even the Giants Amazon Google
and Microsoft they've laid off employees this year after sacking tens of thousands of workers last year but here
is the difference these companies the Giants remain operationally sound they're still
raking in billions their bottom line is steady but that is not the case with
SNAP it is heading towards a crisis of survival big Tech can ride through this
storm but smaller companies like Snap might struggle continuous losses could push them to the brink what they need is
a pivot their survival depends on
it if you ever visit Sri Lanka you'll notice one thing the elephant is omnipresent on the island nation it's
religiously significant and culturally Central to Sri Lanka you see elephant motives in art and architecture they're
also a major tourist attraction Sri Lanka has the highest density of Asian elephants in the world but now they're
dying in large numbers 470 elephants were killed in Sri Lanka last year
mostly in man animal encounters what explains this trend and
how can Sri Lanka reverse it our next report
explores Sri Lanka is known for its Wildlife it's extraordinary it's diverse
but there is one animal that defines it this Majestic creature for 2,000 years
elephants have roamed the island nation they are intertwined with its social fabric symbolizing power prosperity and
spiritual significance they were once a prized possession of Kings elephants were
employed in Warfare they symbolized opulence and strength a sign of Royal
Authority then there's religious significance elephants were embedded in Buddhist religious beliefs they can be
found in folklore they are symbols of wisdom these gentle Giants are revered
as sacred beings but besides its place in history and culture elephants play another
crucial role in Sri Lanka that of ecological balance these Majestic
animals are keystone species they shape habitats they maintain balance of ecosystems and support the survival of
others but what about their own Survival since the 19th century Sri Lanka's
elephant population has fallen by almost 65% a decade ago 250 elephants died
every year in Sri Lanka the number has risen sharply since then last year 470
elephants died in the island nation most of them were killed so why are Sri
Lanka's elephants dying the biggest reason is human animal conflict Sri Lanka's forests are depleting its
farmlands are growing that means more elephants and human encounters they are entering Villages
they are trampling crops killing an elephant is punishable by law but farmers are doing everything to protect
their farmlands this includes electric fences poison jaw bombs AKA crude bomb
warms the other worrying trend is the death of male elephants a large number of them are dying they are key for the
survival of the species more often than not these tuskers venture out they end up in human settlements they are
stranded and they end up dead the young ones are dying
too 70% of elephants that died due to draw bombs were not even adults Sri
Lanka has the highest density of Asian elephants in the world once nearly 5,800
elephants room the island nation now the number has dwindled experts say it won't
be more than 4,000 so what can Columbo do to protect its revered national symbol Wildlife
experts have suggested two measures more protected areas for elephants and asking
Farmers to grow crops that don't attract them because elephant encounters have a human toll too last year nearly 200
people were killed plus there are damages to farmlands which means Sri Lanka is at a Crossroads elephants are
crucial for the country for its ecological balance for its tourism industry its Wildlife tourism is worth
some 400 million dollar most of it's because of this majestic beast but its
conservation efforts are not bearing any fruit globally Sri Lanka had the highest annual elephant debts if it doesn't act
fast soon 70% of Sri Lanka's elephants will be gone so the government has a dual challenge ahead of it saving its
Flagship species while protecting the livelihoods of its people
people it's election year in the US so a good time to look back at Joe Biden's
presidency what do you think was his biggest failure maybe the war in Ukraine
or the Israel Hamas war or his failure to revive the Iran nuclear deal outside
the US yes these were important setbacks but if you ask Americans you may get a different
answer they may tell you his biggest failure was the Border
let's talk numbers first how many migrants did officials detain at the US
Mexico border in 2019 around 850,000 that was during the Trump
presidency and last year around 2 and A2 million the numbers are staggering
December alone logged more than 300,000 detentions but why is this happening for a number of
reasons during the pandemic lockdown people could not migrate so there is pent up demand plus Biden's reelection
is not certain if Donald Trump wins this year he could complete his border wall so migrants are making a dash they want
to enter before the US election and what is Biden doing to stop
this until now very little first he sent his vice president to Latin America her
message was borderline Hollywood villain I want to be clear to folks in this
region who are thinking about making that dangerous track to the United
States Mexico border do not come do not come no luck people kept
pouring in around 70% Americans disapprove of Biden's border policy they say he's failed even Democrats are
struggling to defend him in November last year five Mayors wrote a letter to Joe Biden these were mayors of Chicago
New York Denver Houston and Los Angeles all five were Democrats and what did they want better border policies because
their cities are swamped by migrants in Chicago they're sleeping outside police stations in New York a cruise ship
terminal is now a shelter in Denver migrant arrivals are up 10-fold so these cities are overrun they
may want to welcome migrants but the infrastructure is not available so finally Biden has woken up he's managed
to strike a deal on immigration reform it sets aside $20 billion for the Border
solu and what would this deal do number one fast track Asylum cases number two give more Authority and freedom to
deport migrants number three reduceed parole for detained migrants and number four a border shutdown
clause and this could be controversial it says the president can shut down the border under two conditions a if 8,500
migrants cross in a single day or B if daily average Crossing stop 5,000 in a
week Mexico is already complaining about this
so the position of we are going to close the borders is very demagogic for example I have a lot of respect for
President Biden he has conducted himself very well so did President Trump before
he was very respectful of us we understand the circumstances but imagine closing the border the deal may help Joe
Biden just one problem though Trump and his Hardline Republicans won't support it so chances are it won't pass in
Congress and that's politics for you Biden had 3 years to sort out the border to increase funding to set up more curbs
but he failed to do any of that and when does he decide to make a move in election here so Republicans are on the
charge on Tuesday they tried a drastic move in the US House they moved a motion to impeach President Biden's Homeland
Security chief his name is Alejandro mayorcas he's also Biden's top border
official luckily for him the motion Was Defeated because four Republicans decided to Buck the party leadership but
next time could be different so what does Joe Biden plan to do campaign on it
his plan is to point at the border chaos and say it's Trump's fault I'll be taking this issue to the country and the
voters are going to know that it's not just a moment just at the moment we're going to secure the border and fund
these other programs Trump and the Maggie Republicans said no because
they're afraid of Donald Trump but it could go either way maybe vter will blame Donald Trump for blocking the bill
or maybe they'll blame the Man In Charge which is Joe Biden either way it's a blemish on his legacy some 6.3 million
migrants have been detained under Biden's rule Trump Obama and Bush had fewer detentions so there's no point
blaming others Biden came to power promising a Humane immigration policy
the same Biden now says I will shut down the Border all those people are seeking
Asylum they deserve to be heard that's who we are we're a nation says if you want to flee and you're freeing
oppression you should come if that bill were the law today I'd shut down the border right now and fix it
quickly a bipartisan bill would be good for America and help fix our broken immigration system and allow Speedy
access for those who deserve to be here the 2024 elections will be fought on a number of issues but the Border will
feature prominently Trump the world champion versus Biden the shutdown guy
it's the same policy with two names
now let's discuss your travel plans for work or for leisure if you're heading towards Europe or China you may have to
reassess your plans because both these sectors have plunged into chaos travel
has been disrupted thanks to strikes and extreme weather in Europe workers across
various countries are on strike or they plan to go on one and in China the winter storm has turned travel into a
nightmare roads are jammed drivers are stuck on highways many trains and flights have been cancelled our next
report tells you more millions of Chinese citizens wait
for the Luna year it's that time of the year when they get a chance to reunite with their families but this year their
plans have been thrown into chaos this is a train station in Wuhan yesterday
hundreds of Travelers were left stranded a snowstorm led to mass cancellations
over 100 trains went out out of service over the weekend it was the
airports they were covered in snow two runways on the Wuhan airport went
inoperational the site on the roads wasn't too different in the Hunan Province IC roads brought traffic to a
grinding halt the storm has impacted China's capital Beijing as well it has forced
passengers to rethink their plans I was originally considering how
to change my tickets to see if I could change to another train but because I have my son with me I'm worried that if
we get separated after the change I won't be able to take care of him there are thousands more like
sunjong China Spring Festival triggers the world's largest annual migration every year and this time China was
expecting a massive Surge and travel travel agents were expecting holiday travel in China to bounce
back China's AV ation regulator had scheduled 2,500 extra international
flights transport officials said they were expecting another 480 million rail trips a 40% rise from last year but bad
weather is playing spoil sport in Germany too travel is disrupted
but not because of the weather it's due to a strike workers at lansa are staging
a walk out they're demanding better wages and they are angry with lans's manager
for us strikes are only used when there is no other option but we've now had two rounds of negotiations which have been
really sobering Lanza presented an offer in the last round but it's not only inadequate it's also divisive groups of
employees are being played off against each other so to speak it is completely unacceptable to
us many flights have been cancelled over 100,000 passengers passers are hit they
all have to reschedule their flights last week Germany's transport employees had walked
out Europe's farmers are up in arms they have put down their tools boarded their tractors blocked roads and plunged the
block into chaos the first to take to the streets were polish Farmers they started the blockades last year it was
the first call to action but now it has spread across the region in France Farmers blocked highways leading to
Paris they overturned trucks set up tents and burned produce the aim was simple they wanted to starve the
capital we will go to Paris show our rage show our discontent show that something must be done today the
profession can no longer survive it is being strangled similar scenes in Germany
thousands braved freezing temperatures they took to the streets and blockaded the country's biggest airport there was
absolute chaos and and the picture is the same everywhere in Europe in Greece Farmers dumped their produce in Belgium
they targeted border crossings in Italy farmers lit fires and in Portugal there
were long lines of trucks most of it was peaceful but in Brussels they vented their anger it is after all the
headquarters of the European Union Farmers rolled into the city camped outside the EU Parliament lit fires
blared their horns and hit the Parliament building with eggs soon the situation turned tense police had to be
called in they H down the angry
[Applause] [Music]
[Applause] Farmers the import in Belgium and Europe is from outside the rules in outside of
Europe are too easy it's too difficult for us to farm normally on the daily
base it's too too difficult for us we ask uh easier rules farming makes up
just 1.4% of the eu's GDP yet the blockades are a serious nuisance they've cut supplies to countries fresh produce
is hard to come by and prices have been rising you see Angry farmers are never good news and when coupled with
inflation they spell disaster which brings us to three main questions why are Europe's Farmers protesting what are
governments doing about it and will these measures be enough first of all why the protest Farmers across the EU
have a lot of grievances a lot of complaints there's Rising debts cheap Imports price pressures climate change
and the eu's heavy regulations Farmers must abide by strict laws which do not
apply outside the European Union these laws make farming in Europe more expensive so their produce costs more
but in the market they must compete with cheap Imports obviously they lose out
then there are country specific issues like tax breaks and subsidies governments are reducing these and
Farmers don't like the idea so they've been protesting and after weeks of protest they seem to be winning European
governments are offering a compromise and Farmers seem to have won this round the EU wanted to Harve the use of
pesticides it has now scrapped the plan it has also made other concessions plus
countries are taking measures individually France was going to increase diesel tax it has scrapped the
plan Germany was going to cut diesel subsidies they watered down the plan and
Greece has announced a special tax rebate on agricultural diesel so
concessions are being granted but will it be enough Farmers say they need more
their biggest complaint is cheap Imports mostly from Ukraine it's flooding European markets and hurting the
business of farmers in Europe we took to the streets to protest
against Europe and the new laws it is making agriculture has already been on its knees for a long time and we took to
the streets because we have reached the end of our rope we demanding a better tomorrow with
lower production costs lower fuel prices lower electricity prices and a fair
distribution of subsidies now while this story is about Europe let me digress a bit because for
our viewers in India the scenes may look familiar India went through something similar Farmers took to the streets in
2020 protesting against new Farm laws the West was quick to lecture they slammed the Indian government and its
handling of the situation countries like Canada also tried to stop the fire the protest continued for months finally the
government gave in it made concessions now Europe is witnessing the same and headlines like these have
emerged police moved to end Dutch farmer protests whatever happened to their
freedom of expression the point here is simple protests are a part and parcel of democracy but they cannot be allowed to
cross a line and hurt public order when they do law enforcement agencies have to act in India and in
Europe our next story is about the sun it is flipping out quite literally scientists
say the sun's poles are about to flip just like the Earth the Sun has two magnetic poles the magnetic north and
the Magnetic South on Earth the poles rarely change their order they flip once every hundreds of thousands of years but
on the sun it is a fairly regular occurrence the poles flip about every 11
years they last reversed in 2013 and you don't have to be a math genius to know
that the next reversal will take place this year scientists say it will be an epic
transformation but they also claim that it can be terrifying for us so how will this Shuffle impact the
Earth should earthlings be scared no matter which school you went
to you were bound to learn three things by root one the Pythagoras Theorem two
mitochondria our Powerhouse of the cell and three the sun is a big ball of
fire this story is about that last bit because this year the ball of fire is
quite the hot topic for starters a total solar eclipse is predicted in April this happens when
the moon crosses paths with the sun blocking it from view it is a highly
anticipated event for scientists but they are concerned over one thing fact
that the sun itself self is getting ready to flip its poles are about to reverse
here's how just like the Earth the Sun has two poles the magnetic north and the
Magnetic South every 11 years the polar magnetic fields weaken they go to zero
and then emerge again with much more energy but with opposite polarity so the
North Pole becomes the South and vice versa this is a regular part of the the
solar cycle unlike the one on Earth where the poles flip once every hundreds
of thousands of years the sun's poles last reversed in 2013 even those bad at math will know
that the next due date will be sometime this year now this may sound scary but
the flip is not a big deal what comes before the flip is leading up to the
pole reversal the sun has intense magnetic activity right now the sun is
more active than it's been in over a decade during these periods the sun displays extravagant fireworks there are
solar flares or mass ejections scientists call them solar storms think
of them as explosions they H charged matter out of the sun and it is shot
across the solar system at a speed of hundreds of thousands of kilometers per hour these particles can reach Earth in
typically 3 days and the results depend on what happens Happ s next remember we
told you about the Earth's magnetic poles that's because the Earth has a magnetic field too usually this field
acts like an umbrella it deflects the storm much like rain bounces off an umbrella but sometimes the storm is so
strong it rips through the Earth's magnetic field and the results can vary
on the positive side solar storms can result in Vivid auroras which is why
this year the northern lights will be stronger than they have been in at least a decade but in some scenarios solar
storms can be the perfect storm for disasters they can disrupt communication
satellites and GPS in space and disable electrical grids on the ground the
possibility of such a hit is rare but it can happen like it did in
1859 when the earth witnessed the Carrington event it was the worst solar storm in history a disrupted Telegraph
lines hindered messages sparked fires and auroras were witnessed in Mexico
City it was a shock event and if a similar incident occurs now it could
cost economies trillions but in most cases this active time for the sun is
not dangerous it has more positives than negatives for starters scientists have
an opportunity to dig deep into the sun secondly you can start planning your
next vacation
for our last story today let's turn our attention to Zimbabwe not the African
nation of Zimbabwe I'm talking about Zimbabwe do you know what it
is have you ever heard of an upper decky lip
pillow okay let me ask you an easier question do you know what Zin is z
YN if these words sound like a madeup language to you do do not feel bad most
adults do not know what Zin is but gen Z do which is alarming on so many levels
because Zin is a brand of nicotine pouches think tobacco dips minus the
tobacco but all of the nicotine there is about 12 Mig of nicotine per pouch 15
such pouches cost about $4 each pouch is a tiny sack the size of a gum it comes
in all kinds of fun flavors bubble gum blueberry lime it has to be nestled between the lip and the gum the nicotine
slowly leaks out of the paper accessing and using these pouches is easy and this poses a difficult
problem according to the World Health Organization nicotine pouches are a major health concern they contain
exceptionally high levels of nicotine which is an addictive chemical they can affect nervous and cardiac systems
damaged DNA even lead to cancer but Zin influencers couldn't care less they're
influencers and they have one goal to promote nicotine pouches like Zin on social media and their target audience
is the youth especially children these influencers have made nicotine pouches trendy by promoting them as an effective
tool to quit vaping some are shipping pouches directly to customers or giving
user discounts on their profiles and children are lapping these up the market
for nicotine pouches doubled between 2020 and 2021 in one year the market has doubled in Croatia the Czech Republic
Denmark Slovakia and the United Kingdom in the UK 1 in 25 people have tried a
nicotine pouch the biggest User Group here is 18 to 24 year olds in America
about 16% of the same age group have tried these pouches and about 2% of middle school students use them every
month the sales have skyrocketed in America as well now Zin is the crown
jewel of a multi-billion million dollar Tobacco Company 105 million tins of Zin
were sold in America just in the third quarter last year earning $9 billion in Revenue by
mid January this year the sales were up 87% nicotine pouches are all the rage in
Australia as well children are carrying them to school and they're slowly gaining popularity in Japan and India at
this point nicotine pouches are not just products they are a subculture a language among the young hash tags like
Amazin zinful Zin Laden Ghana hundreds of millions of views they're Brewing
culture wars they have riled up politicians they have become the latest success story of influencers you see
influencers are not your traditional pitch people think of them as the coolest Kids on the Block they gain
millions of followers thanks to their personality not so much their experience expertise or credibility and they
promote all kinds of things from skincare to crypto to diets and Vapes sometimes they're paid to make baseless
claims and they don't mind being deceitful in their approach like in this video where a
grown influencer portrays as a sixth grader talking about the need for nicotine pouch before participating in a
spelling B young people are susceptible to this kind of promotion the result is
sometimes slightly amusing like children running around Sephora Isles trying new skincare products but in most cases it
can be D dangerous we see this with Vapes they're now a growing epidemic
among children and it is no shock that adults rarely know about such Trends because social media algorithms are too
efficient for their own good they serve problematic influencers on a digital platter but only to Children meanwhile
adults see content on gardening and vacuum cleaners influencers and social
media algorithms are a potent combination possibly the most powerful tool of advertising ever invented
and like most things on social media influencers are still vastly unregulated they're not held
accountable as we lose an entire generation in the tragic Vortex of social media because to governments
social media is still a monster they cannot control now if only there was an
influencer to teach them how and now it's time for vanted shots images that tell the story in California
torrential downpour sweep the state leaving behind flooded streets mudslides and debris in Germany floats for the
cologne Carnival poke fun at world leaders and in the UAE camel breeders
compete in the Kingdom's Annual Festival finally we're taking you back in history on this day in 1992 European nations
signed the marrich treaty it led to the creation of the European Union it also
led to the formation of a single European currency the Euro we're leaving you on that note thanks for watching
we'll see you tomorrow
