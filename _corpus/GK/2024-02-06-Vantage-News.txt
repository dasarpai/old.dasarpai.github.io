2022 just like investors in the stock market there are two kinds of leaders bulls and bears what would you call Xi
Jinping if you asked him he'd probably say he's a bull someone who can drive the Chinese economy to newer Heights but
his limitations stand exposed there is panic in Beijing investors are fleeing China they're dumping Chinese stocks the
loss so far is $7 trillion in less than 3 years 7 trillion in less than three
years last week there was a selloff that alone led to a loss of almost $2
trillion in value the problem is too big to ignore and president Xi Jinping has
finally decided to step in he called a meeting with Chinese Regulators to find a way to improve Global sentiment about
China and its worsening economy the meeting was supposed to take place today so far we've not heard about the outcome
no big announcements yet earlier today the news of this impending meeting lifted Chinese
markets but it has not impressed major investors they seem to have run out of
patience and they're moving their money to India we're talking about billions of dollars in investment in Indian stocks
Wall Street banks are placing bigger bets there is a gold rush and the shift is hard to miss investors prefer India
over China increasingly because India has consistently proven to be The Driver of growth with China developing a
serious perception problem now it is no longer seen as an
invest friendly destination not just for foreign investors but also for the local ones they're unhappy and many of them
are venting on webo webo as you would know is one of China's biggest social
media platforms it's like their Twitter or X so here's what Chinese users are
doing they look for the account of the US Embassy in Beijing and they start posting comments to it these comments
are basically criticism they're slamming China's economic policies but why do it
on the US Embassy page it's a way to escape Chinese sensor it's a trick that
these people have devised you see when you post on social media sensors pick it up but when you comment on someone
else's post there's a lesser chance of Discovery or so they think it's a relatively Spa safer space to criticize
China which is why they go to the US Embassy account on vibo it's being flooded by
comments on one particular post there were over 100,000
comments let me show you some of them this is what they're saying could you spare us some missiles to bomb away the
Shanghai stock exchange the webo account of the US Embassy in China has become the Wailing
Wall of Chinese retail Equity investors these are comments by Chinese
users and do you know where they were posted below the picture of a
giraffe the original post was about Wildlife Conservation but the comment section is filled with criticism of the
Chinese economy well played we say these comments are also revealing they show
that a large number of Chinese citizens are unhappy with the Meltdown in their markets for six straight months now
investors have been selling Chinese stocks in large numbers last month alone
Global funds sold Chinese stocks worth $2 billion and they've not seen the worst
yet experts say China's Equity Market is yet to hit the bottom I have an assessment from nura that's
Japan's largest Investment Bank they think China's economic dip and I'm quoting is likely is ongoing and is
likely to worsen and what is the basis of this assessment China's weakening economy it
faces multiple challenges from a failing property sector to a Contracting manufacturing sector last month Factory
output declined for the fourth straight month manufacturing is clearly slow going down and I'm not the one saying
this China's official data for a change shows the real picture the sector is
shrinking and when you join all of these dots it's easy to see why China is being
called uninvestable so investors are looking for Alternatives and they're narrowing
down on India two Wall Street banks have endorsed India the Goldman Sachs group
and Morgan Stanley they have a projection for the next decade they say India is the prime investment
destination Goldman Sachs expects robust inflows into the Indian markets Morgan Stanley believes and I'm quoting India
will become the third largest economy by 2027 after the US and
China and numbers support their assessment last year the Indian stock market received some $20 billion from
foreign investors the momentum is clearly on India's side experts say Indian stocks are now overpriced they're
among the most expensive in the world look at the top Indian companies their Shares are 27% more expensive when
compared with the average prices from 2010 to 2020 so one can expect a price
correction too but the larger picture looks like this more people are buying into India's growth Story the world is
betting on India's rise and the overall trajectory remains positive what about
China well they have their task cut out short-term measures and assurances will not be enough anymore they'll need
concerted action to win back investors and reverse their Decline and the owners
is squarely on sh Xi
Jinping in Pakistan the countdown is on the election campaigning ended today
it's all up to the voters of Pakistan now actually scratch that it's all up to
the army of Pakistan now we know that every election is a battle of faces and
in Pakistan you have three faces IM KH of the PTI Naas Sharif of the Muslim
League and belaval B zardari of the PPP of course there's a fourth phase
that of army Chief Asim munir but why list the Puppet Master with the puppets
so let's leave him out now as you know Imran Khan is in jail so his campaigning has been through artificial intelligence
a lot of deep fakes and written notes the other two have hit the trail bilaval
BTO had a rally in Karachi yesterday he T the city in an open truck and the
turnout quite impressive actually baval B zardari visited a number of streets and districts he also stopped
occasionally to speak to people by the end of it he looked visibly
exhausted his pitch was mostly around
growth
[Music]
until last year belaval BTO was allied with the shars together they had toppled Imran Khan but BTO does not want to
repeat he says he won't be foreign minister if nawas Sharif wins the election not unless Sharif breaks the
old Politics the politics of Revenge we say say good luck with
that now sharif's last rally was today the whole family lined up on stage in
kasur it's a city south of laor again the turnout was quite impressive sharif's pitch was all about Pakistan's
youth around 40% of the voters are below 35 years of age so Naas Sharif turned on
the charm to woo
them
youth
youth Pakistan Pakistan Muslim
League so that's campaigning done on Thursday Pakistani voters will head to
the polls let's look at some some of the key numbers Pakistan has 128 million
voters but chances are a lot of them won't turn up turnout is traditionally low there in 2018 it was over
15% the voting age is the same as here in India 18 years more than 5,100
candidates are in the free most of them are men only three 312 women are
contesting this time imagine that just 312 out of more than 5,000 candidates
some 167 political parties are registered their candidates are fighting for 266 seats in Parliament and finally
polling stations more than 990,000 of them have been set up around half of them have been
declared sensitive around 18,000 are highly sensitive meaning these are located in restive areas there is risk
of violence or attacks 18,000 as a result major deployments are
being planned some 650,000 security Personnel will oversee this
election now we come to the issues just three of them honestly the first of course is the economy Pakistan's
inflation is almost 30% the country is hurtling from one IMF bailout to the
next so every voter has the same complaint they can barely make ends meet
we need petrol the whole day we do get customers but they always bargain over the fairs it is very difficult to
survive what can we do there is no solution to the problem because the fuel is so expensive I don't know what to
do so my business has been impacted a lot before the tea was 20 25 and 30
rupees now it is 60 to 70 rupees because nowadays the prices of tea and sugar got
very expensive the second issue is Imran Khan his
supporters will use this election to seek revenge to maybe spring a surprise they'll try to but logistically it will
be tough because Imran Khan's party has lost its election symbol the cricket bat so most of its candidates are contesting
as Independents their support could be crucial and finally the third issue
rigging expect a lot of it on Thursday pakistanis themselves know what to expect polling agency gallop surveyed
1,000 Pakistani adults last year 70% of them did not trust the election it's a
small sample size but it gives you the sentiment they don't think the election
will be free or fair so the real question is this what's the point of the
Sham one major player is in jail the other was in jail and the third's biggest asset is his last name forget
democracy in action this is democracy in free fall
and from democracy in freef fall to the rise of rice prices it's a serious pain Point especially in Asia home to more
than 4 billion people whose staple food is rice Asians consume more rice than
anyone in the world 90% of the world's rice is produced and consumed here 90
90% but these days rice is burning a hole in Pockets there's a shortage in the market and that is driving up prices
dramatically take the case of the Philippines last month rice inflation in the Philippines crossed
22% the highest level since March 2009 what is the country's overall
inflation rate 2.8% last month 2.8% inflation but rice
prices are growing at over 22% which is eight times faster and it's not just the Philippines many other countries are
reeling rice inflation is hitting them hard in Nepal for instance rice prices have shot up by 7 % in Vietnam prices
are rising Rising by almost 10% on a monthly basis and by almost 20% on a
yearly basis Malaysia has been forced to cap rice prices this is after imported
rice became way too expensive prices shot up in October last year by whopping
36% the trend is quite clear the question is why why are rise prices on
fire some experts are blaming India for this until last year India was the world's leading exporter 40% of the
world's rice Supply came from India but then prices began rising at
home there were Supply disruptions India wanted to control inflation like everyone else it wanted to ensure a
surplus stock at home so India imposed export restrictions some types of rice were
banned from export and the result was this some 9 million metric tons of rice disappeared
from the global market Market an expert in Washington gave an assessment India's export curbs have
created quote unquote a big hole to fill and this argument has some Merit yes
India is supplying less rise to Global markets but that is not the only reason behind the shortage rice production is
shrinking worldwide and the reason for that is climate change extreme weather events like floods and droughts are
hampering and hurting Harvest so overall there is less rice to go
around farmers are unable to keep up with the rising demand and the falling Supply and the impact of extreme weather
is being felt across Asia Indonesia is predicting a lower harvest in Vietnam
rice Farmers have received instructions they've been asked to plant their crop earlier than scheduled so that they have
adequate water supply in the Philippines farmers are getting Aid to cope with extreme weather last year El Nino led to
drought droughts and dry spells in the country elino is a weather phenomenon it
causes higher temperatures similarly India is calibrating its response it has no immediate plans to
lift the rice ban the rice export ban but it has made exceptions for some countries India is sending rise to some
Partners including immediate neighbors like Nepal Bhutan Sri Lanka and the Maldives also some asan Nations like
Indonesia and Vietnam Reports say the first eight in the first eight months of
2023 India sold rice worth over $500 million to South Asian countries asan
Nations received some $340 million worth of Indian rice so there is no sweeping ban New Delhi is being careful with its
supplies having said that this episode makes one thing quite clear the world's current approach is unsustainable India
alone cannot bear the burden of stabilizing Global rise prices climate change is sure to disrupt
supplies in the future too the only way way to deal with this is to mitigate global
warming rice may come in different types but some things are best when uniform
like laws for example that's the big debate unfolding in India as we speak the state government of utarak tabled a
bill today the UCC bill that's the uniform civil code and what does it do it aims to
create uniform personal laws in the State like when you marry or get a divorce or inherit parental wealth the
same law should apply to all right now it's different for each religion Hindus
have different personal laws Muslims have their own so do other religions this bill aims to abolish most of that
instead one uniform law will govern personal lives it's a big reform it's
also a controversial one the UCC has been a divisive issue in India one side says why bother why not let the
diversity exist the other side says what about rights and uniformity why should
two citizens of the same country follow different laws India's ruling party belongs to the
second Camp that's the BJP they want the UCC the manifesto in 2019 in fact
promised the uniform civil court it's not happened at the national level but many BJP rule states are planning their
own versions and utarak is the first its cabinet approved the bill last week
today the bill was tabled it's expected to be passed in the next couple of days after that the UCC will apply in utak so
no personal laws only a uniform one in this state now why is this important a
because it has never happened before no Indian state has implemented the UCC since Independence one state Goa already
has it but goa's UCC dates back to Portuguese rule so it's unprecedented in
Independent India and B it's a template for the future
States like Gujarat and Assam are watching closely their UCC could be similar to this
one so let's look at uttarakhand's Bill what's good what's okay and what is not
acceptable for starters tribal groups are excluded UCC Provisions will not
apply to members of scheduled tribes secondly polygamy has been banned
meaning you can take only one spouse if you already have a partner you cannot marry again not
unless you divorce marriageable age has been fixed 21 for men and 18 for women no matter
your religion you cannot marry below that age and finally a controversial
provision that of live in relations the utarak government wants live in couples to register themselves an official will
then check a few things like are both Partners adults have they both given consent is one of
them married once these checks are done the living relationship is
registered but what happens if you don't inform then after a month you can be punished up to 3 months in jail and up
to 10,000 rupees in fine now we understand the idea here a lot of Livin
relationships have gone sour some have ended in violence and death so the government wants more control but
honestly it's a slippery slope two consenting adults should be able to live together they should not require
government permission or registration no democracy has such a rule utarak should not be an exception
hopefully good sense will prevail now let's focus on the larger picture does India need a
UCC well our founding fathers thought so the uniform civil code is part of the
Constitution it's included in the directive principles of State policy think of them as suggestions for the
government leaders may or may not take them but these suggestions are there in the constitution in this case the BJP
has taken the suggestion the question is will a nationwide UCC be
next things are moving in that direction the UCC could be a reality if Prime Minister Modi is
reelected maybe the utarak bill is a trailer of that and will the opposition
agree well there's no Clarity on what their official position is India's biggest opposition is the congress party
their leader in utarak khand says he's not opposed to the UCC but in the past
their leaders have rejected it it tells you how contentious the issue is but it doesn't mean we should
abandon it mature countries don't run away from tough issues they confront them they debate them and finally they
reach consensus India should do the same on UCC I know we are a country of many diversities and that is indeed our
strength but you can't use that to justify injustices how does diversity explain a man taking multiple wives how
does it explain a woman being denied an Cal wealth or child marriage in some
remote Village it doesn't my point is beliefs and customs should not violate
your rights no matter which religion you belong to the hope is a UCC can remedy
that as for The Descent and opposition there is only one solution a fair
transparent an unbiased process such a uniform civil code should be our
goal now let's talk about Iran a country under heavy Western sanctions and caught in the middle of a volatile conflict in
West Asia despite all the challenges Iran remains an influential player in the region practicing its own brand of
strategic autonomy usually its militia groups provide thean with crucial leverage but
now the regime regim has a new tool in its Arsenal a new strategic lever to pull I'm talking about Iranian drones
they're becoming the weapon of choice for many countries across the world why because they're cheaper and they can
inflict some serious damage our next report tells you about Iran's Rising drone
power the mighty US military is up against a new enemy they're fast often
easy to detect but when they are fired in large volumes one of them can easily breach American defenses this is what it
looks like these are drones made by
Iran last month one such drone attacked the US forces in Jordan and inflicted
heavy damage the capabilities of the Drone left the Americans
surprised there are still many questions to include how the oneway attack drone could have penetrated the facility's air
defenses its point of origin and which which specific Iranian proxy group is
responsible experts say it was one of the Shahed drones they became famous after entering the Ukrainian Battlefield
the Russian forces have relied on them since the beginning of the war now iran-backed militia forces have been
spotted using the same drones Iran has a huge drone Fleet ranging from small lightweight weapons
to large flying machines tahan's main weapon is this drone the Shahed 129 also
known as is the AK-47 of tan the weapon packs a punch it has a range of 150 km
the Drone can carry multiple missiles and stay in the air for more than 15 hours a few years ago Iran upgraded this
drone and developed the Shahed 136 this drone is also known as kamikazi it has a
range of over 2,000 km and can carry around 20 to 40 kilos of explosives the
Drone can fly into the target crash and explode
these drones are cheap to make and easy to mass produce one Shahed drone can be manufactured for as little as
$20,000 Iran's drone program is not new it began in the 1980s but over the last
decade tan has made some rapid advances all these drones come from One Source
the Shahed Aviation Industries this is an Iranian Aerospace company and is linked to Iranian revolutionary guard
core the company is believed to have reverse engineered Israeli and American drones how does it manufacture these
drones the information is limited but going by some claims Iran gets its
supplies from a range of sources the parts come from over 70 manufacturers
spread out in 13 countries and territories and includes the West
despite the sanctions Iran has managed to assemble drones with western parts according to an assessment of Iranian
drones found in Ukraine over 80% ENT of the parts came from American companies Washington has used sanctions
to put an end to Iran's drone program but so far the US has failed to make a
dent or even minimize the damage they've caused in west Asia's
Battlefield who doesn't like Leonel Messi football pundits would say no one
he is a genius of the game also a World Cup winner with Argentina but askar around in Hong Kong and you might get a
different answer I'll tell you why on Sunday Messi's team inter Miami was in
Hong Kong they played a pre-season friendly in the city some 38,000 fans were in attendance all of them wanted
just one thing to see Leonel Messi play and for that they paid a lot of money up
to $634 us per ticket which is around 52,000 Indian rupees for one
ticket but guess what Messi did not take the field he stayed on the bench as a substitute player so
the fans got angry they started chanting refund during the
match inter Miami won won the match but they lost the Crow and it wasn't just a
players and Coach even club owner David Beckham was booed he was clicking pictures on the sidelines but when he
took the mic look at what
[Music]
[Music] happened [Applause]
so I guess the question is what happened here why did Messi take the field
according to him because of an
injury in Hong Kong we had an Open Door training session and I went out because there was such a big crowd there and
there was a clinic with the kids and I wanted to be there and participate but the truth is that the discomfort was
still there and it was very difficult for me to play
and injury is an injury but tell that to the fans Messi's Nosh show has spiraled into a crisis fans are demanding answers
Hong Kong's government wants accountability and a lot of money is at stake Sunday's match was organized by
tler Asia part of it was supposed to be funded by the government how much was that around $2 million but tler was with
has withdrawn that application they say they won't take the public money not like they had an option fans
old already targeting them and tearing them apart on social media so taking public money was a
nonstarter but the trouble does not end there Hong Kong wants tatler to reveal its contract with inter Miami did it say
that Messi would definitely play or was injury a possibility listen to what
their CEO said on Sunday before kickoff
the official team Sheet a list of the players who are available to play in the game which was
submitted by the inter Miami CF team and signed by the head coach Gerardo Martino
showed lonel Messi and Luis Suarez as substitute and therefore fit to
play accordingly tatra Asia had every expectation that b would play the
game so to recap the organizers say Messi was on the team sheet if you're on the team Sheet you're fit and that's a
fair point things could have been certainly handled better maybe inter
Miami could have informed in advance apparently they told the organizers only after
Halftime by then it was too late the organizers also pitched a backup plan
maybe Messi could speak to the fans sort of like a consolation address but that too did not work out so
in the end the fans went back angry all they saw was messy s on the sidelines I
guess you can call it a giant miscommunication the organizers thought Messi would play the government thought
Messi would play but the club had other plans something similar happened last
month Cristiano Ronaldo's Club was supposed to play in China days before the match Ronaldo picked up an
injury so guess what the club did first they canceled the match then they made
Ronaldo apologize could something similar have been done here in Hong Kong I'm afraid
it's impossible to know in such cases there is no perfect response you have to accept the harsh reality Messi is almost
36y old he's key to inter Miami's title hopes this season not to mention their
commercial success and you can't risk your Talisman at the same time you feel for
the fans 50,000 Rupees is a lot of money for a ticket some of them traveled to Hong Kong from other countries they
wanted to catch a glimpse of Messi in action you can't blame them for being angry so going forward I guess there is
just one solution better communication do not oversell your event do not overpromise make sure you're promoting
what you can deliver there's another Miami match tomorrow this time in Tokyo I'm sure fans have paid a lot of money there as
well but Messi may still be a noow if I'm being honest I still don't
know whether I can or not attend the match in Tokyo but I feel much much better and I'm really looking forward to
being being able to do [Music] it well the fans in Tokyo are in for a
ride it will either be a massive heartbreak or a surprise of their
lifetime for our next story let me ask you something what is the one thing you should not do while driving I know what
the common answers will be talking on the phone texting drinking but here's another thing that you should not do
while driving it's playing games on your virtual reality headset that should be
obvious right yet it's happening in America a Tesla driver was caught with his VR headset on while driving the
video has since gone viral it has even prompted alarm from the US government the transportation secretary says
drivers must pay attention at all times our next report tells you why V are in
driving don't mix are you at work playing with your
children doing household chores watching TV you can do all of this with a VR
headset at least that's what Apple claims but can you drive a car with one
apple says no but that hasn't stopped people last week Apple released its
Vision Pro headset it is a virtual reality headset The Vision Pro Blends 3D digital
content with the outside world that way you you are always in touch with reality
but is it good enough to drive a car this Tesla driver says
yes this video has since gone viral on social media it shows the Tesla driver
at the wheel he's wearing a VR headset he's making hand gestures as if trying
to manipulate a VR field the video was posted by us transport ation secretary pach
Budaj he says even assisted driving requires the human driver to be in full
control of course Tesla markets its cars as self-driving there are various
features autopilot enhanced autopilot and full self-driving but as Buddha
pointed out none of that means that vehicles are fully autonomous Tesla agrees to that too it says its features
are for use with a fully attentive driver one who is ready to take over at any
moment so driving with a VR headset is definitely not safe and it's one of the
many dangers of virtual reality you see it is a world changing technology an immersive world but what
happens when that experience is too immersive you lose touch with reality
you don't know what your surroundings are you can trip over wires bump into your TV break something or in the worst
case scenario like that Tesla driver crash your car these are the obvious
physical dangers but then there are other concerns too like those related to health you may not trip and fall but you
could get nauseous using a VR headset only got minutes yes virtual reality
takes you on a bumpy ride and sometimes that leaves you with motion sickness you see in real life our eyes naturally
converge and focus on a point in space our brain is used to this but in VR
those are separ so the brain is confused and it leaves people with an eye strain Plus in a VR
world it is easy to forget your limits people working out in virtual reality
have had dislocated shoulders fractures and have accidentally hit bystanders causing serious damage a 31-year-old
even broke his neck while playing a game so the world of virtual reality may
be immersive it may be interesting but it isn't entirely safe the ground rule
is clear the playing field beware of your surroundings and if you are driving
ditch the headset virtual reality and driving don't
mix our next story comes from Sagal it is home to about 17 million people it is
part of West Africa and one of its most stable democracies Sagal is the only West African nation that has never had a
military coup it has never delayed a presidential election that is until now
the country was going to polls in 3 weeks but yesterday lawmakers passed a contentious bill they extended the
tenure of President macki Saul and pushed elections to December 15th and
just as the postponement was being announced protesters marched across the capital of Dakar calling for a reversal
and clashing with the police now senagal faces a critical test of its Democratic
Integrity here's a report unrest gripped the parliament
just as violence and clashes erupted right outside this is the current state of
West Africa's last Bastion of democracy Sagal it's home to about 17 million
people for years it has been one of the most stable democracies in the usually unstable region of West Africa Sagal is
the only country here that has never had a military coup it has seen three handovers of power all were largely
peaceful it has has never delayed a presidential election that is until now
it was supposed to hold elections in 3 weeks but that wasn't to be yesterday
lawmakers passed a contentious bill they delayed elections by 10 months to the 15th of December and extended the tenure
of the current president makis Sal this came after a heated discussion in the parliament before the vote some
opposition leaders were removed and after it the opposition urged people to Pro protest they vowed to go to court
calling the delay a constitutional coup sagales people you have in front of
you the enemies of the nation they will ask for a contrary opinion on what has just been done this is a constitutional
coup you should be ashamed so just as the bill was being passed inside the parliament violence
erupted outside hundreds took to the streets clashed with the police dear gas
was fired and access to Internet services was restricted that's why we want all the
people of Sagal to come here and to protest peacefully we say so that this
uh aul uh ambition will not take place in this country we deserve Freedom we
have been a peaceful country Democratic Country and this President is not allowed to take our freedom just for
tensions have been brewing for years now the opposition has often claimed that candidates were unlawfully charged with
crimes one major opposition party has even been banned anger has been growing
towards the president and now it seems to have erupted we are only defending ourselves
he meddles with the Constitution he meddles with the newspapers he meddles with the population he does everything
he can to put us in a difficult position I say it and I repeat it again we are
not fighting for a simple cause we're fighting for Freedom makis Sal was first elected in 2012 he came to power again
in 2019 in Sagal a president serves a term of 5 years and is limited to two
consecutive terms critics claim the polls were postponed for political gain
but Sal has not disclosed Ambitions for a third term in office he reiterated the
same this week to calm tempers for my part my solemn undertaking not to
stand in the presidential election remains unchanged but the people of Sagal are
not buying his claim maol must go the Youth of the
country gave him power and today he uses Force to fight us the servitude must
end now Sagal is on the brink and its Democratic credentials hang in the
balance the country is facing a critical test of democratic integrity and only
time will tell if the last Bastion of democracy becomes the newest headache of West
Africa now let's turn our attention to Japan it is in the grip of an ugly Scandal and at the center of it is a
26-year-old beauty queen karolina Shino that's her name Shino was born in
Ukraine she moved to Japan at the age of five she grew up speaking and writing in fluent Japanese in 2022 she became a
naturalized Japanese Citizen and last month she was named Miss Japan the first
woman of European descent to win this title but just as she made history she
became a target of online hate apparently Sho was not Japanese enough
to win the title she decided to look past this she celebrated her win saying
and I'm quoting that she really had been accepted as a Japanese person
but the drama was was not half finished yet just 2 weeks after the win a Japanese Weekly Magazine published an
expose it said Shino was having an affair with a married man do you know what happened next Shino
accepted it issued a public apology and relinquished her title and no this is
not a story from history it's happening as we speak in 2024 you could say what
are beauty pageants without popcorn worthy drama and you may be right but this is not just about the drama this
episode is all sorts of problematic for starters Shino was berated because of her Caucasian
Roots having a Japanese citizenship was not enough meeting the pageant criteria
did not cut it either you had to look Japanese secondly having an affair is
not a criminal act in fact Japan decriminalized adultery in 1947 we are
living in 2024 yet women must apologize for having an affair what about the man by this logic
he too is a villain for cheating on his wife yet only one detail is public knowledge about him and that is his
occupation the man is a doctor and an influencer his name and age stay protected meanwhile Shino faces the
brunt of this affair she's being abused online her name and reputation are being tarnished so much so that she had to
give up her title and that's the thing with be beauty pageants they propagate a problematic
puritanical culture did you know that the success of pageant winners could be measured by the length
of their hair not making this up this year Miss France was quote unquote
violently criticized for her short hair in 2018 Miss Ukraine was
disqualified because officials found out that she was a divorced mother in 2006
Miss missusa was criticized because she liked drinking the co-owner of that
pageant was Donald Trump he publicly forgave her he even considered giving
his permission so she could pose in the Playboy magazine basically showing off your body is fine as long as the man in
charge is giving his Blessing which brings me to problem number three beauty pageants as a whole
they should have no place in our world they were first conceptualized in the 1850s as a marketing tactic used by
newspapers to sell Cosmetics today these pageants are a true embarrassment they
parade women around in bikinis spit them against each other to find the shiniest object in the room as one of them wins
the honor of a sash and a tiara some may say it's more than that
pageants claim that they offer major scholarships but this has long been debunked pageant scholarships usually
offer a fraction of the money they claim they do plus women who participate spend more money than they make and sometimes
they pay a much higher price last year several Miss Universe Indonesia contestants said that they were being
sexually abused by organizers in 2019 Uganda offered a
proposal to hold a Mis curvy beauty contest a beauty pageant to put its
women on display in order to attract foreign visitors such examples are everywhere so
beauty pageants can modernize themselves all they want to they can add categories of intelligence if they like on top of
attractiveness but at the end of the day such pageants are an Antiquated reminder of what we do not want for the women of
today they are retrograde and demeaning and I repeat they should have
no place in our present let alone our
future do you remember the old Facebook posting on people's walls spoking friends tagging strangers in photos in
2004 Facebook started out as a place for Harvard students to connect 20 years later it's a social media Titan it has
multiple apps it faces allegations of data theft and election meddling and its parent company has a new name meta the
world's most popular social media site is 20 but is this birthday a happy one for
Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg how did Facebook change the social media game why is it still
thriving after two decades our next report brings you the Facebook story the year was 2003 Mark Zuckerberg
was at his Harvard Dom the 19-year-old was a computer wiz he was working on an
online Network it was called face smash it allowed users to objectify fellow
students they could rate them they could even vote on who was hotter the idea did not go down well
with the administration in fact it nearly got him expelled but Zuckerberg did not give up face smash gave him the
framework so he started working on something new a different type of online Network one that would later go on to
become Facebook so how did the name come about Facebooks already existed in
Harvard they were essentially an online directory featuring photos of students and their basic information Harvard had
many of them but there was no one with information about all students so Zuckerberg aimed to change that in
February 2004 he launched the facebook.com it was with three of his friends the first iteration was
exclusively available only to Harvard students it proved to be very popular
soon it was expanded to other colleges the likes of Stanford Yale and Colombia in less than a year the facebook.com
became Facebook it had a million users by 2008 Facebook was Unstoppable it
toppled Myspace as the most popular social networking site it had over 50 million
users when Facebook burst onto the scene it changed the social media game you
could write on people's walls you could like stuff you could tag friends in photos all of this was revolutionary and
it fueled its sharp rise in 2011 Facebook played a defining
role in the Arab Spring by 2012 it had a billion
users it's like nothing could go wrong for the social media site it acquired Instagram the photo sharing app it
released its IPO it bought the messaging app WhatsApp it expanded in less connected countries
being on Facebook was the new cool thing but all good things come to an end and
Facebook learned that the hard way the first blow came in 2016 there
were allegations of election meddling of how Russia used the platform to medal in the 2016 US elections then came the
Cambridge analytica files it showed how Facebook had harvested the personal data of millions not just that it used it for
political gains face book paid $725 million to settle the legal action the
incident highlighted a major issue personal data was no longer
personal Zuckerberg promised to do more but he did little more than changed the name of the company by 2021 Facebook was
meta today at least 3 billion people use at least one of its apps every day it
started out as a social network but Zuckerberg built an Empire he changed media he bought out Rivals
and when he couldn't buy them he did the second best thing he copied their best features Olympic gold medalist and
Facebook has continued to grow it's expanding into Arenas of virtual reality and artificial intelligence 20 years ago
Facebook was a simple place to connect with your friends today it's a social media Titan but it's not all hunky dory
usually birthdays are a joyous occasion who did you fire Senator but Zuckerberg
spent his birthday this year being grilled by US senators Facebook's troubles may not be
over anytime soon but two decades in it's still thriving dictating our daily
lives one like one real and one message at a
time and now it's time for Ved chots images that tell the story in Los Angeles mud slides buried cars and
streets causing severe damage in Argentina a runaway dog stole the show after invading the pitch during a
football match and a pod of killer Wales was trapped in drifting ice off the coast of Northern Japan finally taking
