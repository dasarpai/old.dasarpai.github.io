[Music]
Sharma we're still tracking Pakistan it's more drama than we signed up for Imran Khan's
candidates have come on top but they cannot form the government they're not a party nawas Sharif has a party with the
most number of seats but he cannot form the government because he doesn't have enough seats Coalition talks are on so
our protests and court cases may follow we'll try to make sense of the mess for you for India the day began with with
good news eight Indians who were on death row in Qatar have been pardoned most most of them are back home it's a
win for India's quiet diplomacy meanwhile Chinese companies in India are complaining the likes of xiaomi are
under scrutiny PTM to for the Chinese money in it in Indonesia the stage is set for the
world's biggest single day election ever in Israel prime minister Netanyahu wants

Dan it has been accused of spying for
beij [Music] elections are over it's now Coalition
time in Pakistan last week the Army script nearly went wrong so they're writing a new one now and this script
has just one objective to keep Imran Khan out of power we're seeing a lot of negotiations happening first Navas Shari
hosted the MQM it's a political party based in Karachi then came the big meeting former
prime minister Shabah Sharif met the bhos he was welcomed in Lor by belaval BTO zardari they hugged exchanged
pleasantries and then got down to business looks like a coalition is being worked out the Pakistan people's party
and the Pakistan Muslim League together both sides agreed to cooperate
they also resolved to save Pakistan from political instability I guess that means
a coalition but will the numbers work out let's look at the final results candidates backed by Imran Khan lead the
way they won 101 seats Naas sharif's pmln got 75 seats and the BTO PPP got 54
at number four you have the MQM which has 17 seats now Pakistan's National
Assembly their Parliament has 266 members so the majority Mark is
134 if you add pmln that's Naas sharif's party and the PPP B's party you get a
total of 129 just five seats short of majority and where where will those five
seats come from there are many options right now maybe the MQM can join in or
maybe some Independence can be poached and that's already happening we're seeing evidence of that six Independents
have already joined nawas sharif's party many more could be on the way so looks like Pakistan's new government will be a
coalition PPP plus pmln the sharifs and the B zardari coming together again the
same equation as before both these parties together toppled Imran Khan in
2022 now they could be back together how is Imran Khan's PTI reacting to this with anger on Thursday
night they were winning the election but 3 days later they could be in opposition so Imran Khan supporters are angry they
held protests across major Pakistani cities even key highways were blocked take a look at
this
[Music] [Applause] so what happens next more Coalition
talks even if an alliance is struck the final details will have to be worked out who gets key cabinet posts who becomes
prime minister and what will will be the policy Direction all of that will have to be
worked out it won't be a comfortable conversation after all baval BTO zardari had rejected the idea before the
elections he said he would not be foreign minister under nawas Sharif but now he's got leverage Reports
say his father Asif Ali zardari wants to be president again belaval himself has Prime ministerial Ambitions so the
Coalition talks will be interesting but they won't be the only challenge two problems will follow
number one a looming judicial standoff Pakistani courts are flooded with election cases many PTI candidates have
filed complaints they say they are the rightful
winners
it will take time to settle all of this a lot will depend on Imran Khan will he keep the street protest going or will he
hit Paws that decision will determine Pakistan's near future problem number
two the economic path ahead Pakistan's current crisis needed a strong government possibly a single party
regime that would have made bailout talks a lot easier also radical policies often require a clear majority AAR clear
Direction but that's out of the window now we're looking at a bits and pieces government a lot of bickering a lot of
uncertainty and a lot of indecision even Pakistan's stock market has realized that on Friday it lost 1200 points today
again it plunged by 1,800 points so the markets have understood the big picture
it's going to be a troubled period for Pakistan the first priority will be cobbling up a government then comes
economic recovery but what about the long term 50 years later how will we look at this
election the vote itself was a blow to the Army it showed how unpopular the
generals were but don't expect their role to change if anything they could meddle
more and I'll tell you why I say this both the Sharif and the BOS have been rejected by the people Naas Sharif
actually lost one of his two seats so chances are the new government will be deeply unpopular it will struggle for
legitimacy and such unst stable Pakistani regimes often depend on the Army for stability for direction and
also for control so the generals are not going anywhere their grip on the country
may have slipped a bit they've reminded the world of Pakistan's Eternal truth
never bet against the
Army and speaking of placing bets would you invest in a Chinese company if
you're a regular in the in the stock market chances are you'll still clear of anything Chinese at the moment globally
investors are pulling back from China's market and these investors are doing so
because they're apprehensive Chinese stocks are rapidly losing their value and the sentiment applies to Chinese
investments in India as well they're increasingly being viewed with suspicion the broad sentiment is negative and it's
getting worse by the day two leading names are in trouble xiaomi and PM both
are Market leaders xiaomi is among the leading smart smartphone sellers in India while PTM is synonymous with
digital payments but both companies are under the lens now because of their Chinese connections we'll start with xiaomi this
company has raised a concern xiaomi officials have written a letter to the government of India it is about
smartphone component suppliers xiaomi says these suppliers are wary of setting shop in India I have
a quote from that letter this is what it says there are apprehensions among competent suppliers regarding establishing operations in IND
India stemming from the challenges faced by companies in India particularly from
Chinese origin xiaomi India's president has signed this letter and what are the
apprehensions the company did not really spell them out reports say xiaomi is concerned about compliance and Visa
issues but towards the end the statement really gives it away here's what it says challenges faced by companies in
India particularly from Chinese origin that's what xiaomi is worried
about India's security India scrutiny rather of Chinese companies that's what they
don't like their rise in India was rapid but in recent years xiaomi has had some run-ins with the law in 2022 Indian
officials froze their assets assets worth over 600 million dollars they were frozen do you know why because xiaomi is
said to have violated Indian laws by remitting some money illegally so company assets were frozen last year
xiaomi moved court against this decision but a judge rejected their appeal
then you have Vivo another Chinese smartphone maker that has faced scrutiny
just like xiaomi Vivo 2 is accused of remitting money illegally it was also pulled up for Visa violations Reports
say 30 Chinese Executives of Vivo came to India they were given business visas
but when they applied these Executives hid the fact that they worked for Vivo plus some of these employees ended up
traveling to Jammu and Kashmir which was a breach of their business Visa Provisions because Jammu and Kashmir is
a sensitive region foreigners cannot just travel there they need permission for it in addition to a Visa they need a
special permit to visit regions like Jammu and Kashmir Vivo employees violated these rules so India had valid
reasons to investigate but China does not see it this way Beijing says Chinese companies are facing discrimination
listen to this China hopes that India can fully
understand the mutually beneficial nature of the bilateral economic trade cooperation and provide a fair just
transparent business environment for Chinese Enterprises
there if that was indeed the case India wouldn't have cleared 80 Chinese FDI projects in 2022 80 projects were
cleared 80 India doesn't have a problem with Chinese investment it has an issue with shady and murky
transactions and that's the reason why ptm2 is facing scrutiny the Indian fintech giant it is facing regulatory
trouble we've been telling you about this PTM has been put on notice by India Central Bank it has run a foul of
compliances but for many years patm has ignored warnings from authorities and now it faces a potential ban from the
payment space multiple payment services on the app could shut down in
March paytm is also facing scrutiny for its Chinese links the company has a Chinese investor Jack mared ant group
invested in patm although last year they reduced their Stakes now they own less than 10% of the shares in patm now
Reports say the government of India has set up a panel it will look into Chinese investments in PM among other
things moral of the story rule of law may be an alien concept for China but
India's message on that front is quite clear this is non-negotiable if a chinese company or investor wants to do
business in India they'll have to follow the rule
book well China is an exception most countries have a good Rao with India
it's not by fluke though it's the result of consistent diplomacy look at what happened in Qatar
eight Indian Sailors had been jailed by Doha all of them were former Indian Navy
personnel and the charges were quite serious some reports said Espionage at
first Qatar sentenced them to death but India did not give up New Delhi used
quiet diplomacy behind the scenes and today we saw the results seven of the eight Sailors are back in India they
have been freed by Qatar how exactly did that happen how did a death sentence
turn to release listen to what the sailors think we're extremely grateful
to The Honorable prime minister SRI Narendra Modi G it certainly wouldn't have been possible without his personal
intervention and that equation with uh the mayor of Qatar uh I think we're grateful to the
government of India for the bottom of heart for the every effort that has been made and this day wouldn't have been
possible without it so diplomacy worked the sailors think
Prime Minister Modi personally intervened even the government has hinted at this the external Affairs Ministry has thanked the ruler of Qatar
it has also said Prime Minister Modi was personally overseeing the issue we are uh grateful for their
return We gratified on their return uh we deeply appreciate uh the um decision
of the kriis government and the Amir to release them honorable prime minister
has himself personally constantly supervised all the developments in this
case uh and has uh never shied away from any initiatives that would ensure the
return of uh um Indian Nationals uh back to
home and what about the E Sailer he to has been released but his return to India is still being worked out so the
job is almost done now let's take a step back and look at a few important questions why were these Sailors jailed
why was the case dropped and what is the political impact of this diplomatic
win these Sailors were arrested in 2022 all of them worked for the same company
Dar Global in Doha now Qatar did not reveal the charges against them neither
did India but media reports said it was Espionage apparently they were spying
for Israel in the months that followed India got Consular access to these men New Deli tried to get them released but
no luck in October 2023 the sailors were sentenced to death
India decided to appeal that verdict then in early December a key meeting happened Prime Minister Modi and qatar's
Emir were in Dubai both were attending the cop 28 Summit they held a brief discussion on the sidelines and chances
are this is issue the issue of the sailors was also discussed in that meeting but did it work well later that
month the death sentence was reversed around 50 days later the sailors are back home so I guess the Dubai
conversation did work but we don't know how the sailors were
released was it a court deciding to free them or was it a pardon by the emmer the
foreign secretary refused to answer that question but chances are it was a pardon Q's em issues pardons twice a year most
of the freed prisoners are foreigners and India statement vaguely hints at this let me quote from what India said
we appreciate the decision by the Emir of the state of Qatar to enable the release and homecoming of these
Nationals either way it was a political call qari courts do not randomly release alleged spies not unless the Emir tells
them to do so but this success goes beyond just one short interaction in
Dubai it is the result of sustained policy a genuine Outreach to the Muslim world and
now is the perfect time to talk about it tomorrow the prime minister of India is embarking on a tour a Foreign Tour
possibly his last big one before the general election and where is he going the UA and Qatar in the UA he will
inaugurate a massive Hindu temple and meet with the diaspora in Qatar he will meet the Emir tamim IBN hammad
Alani think of it as a gratitude tour and that's been a feature of India's
Outreach it's come at the highest level of government Prime Minister Modi has visited the UAE six times two of those
visits came in the last eight months he's visited Saudi Arabia twice bahin
Oman Jordan and Qatar once this will be his second trip to Qatar now these relations have been mutually beneficial
India is the third largest oil consumer in the world it's a key market for Gulf
Nations then you have the diaspora around 9 million Indians live and work in the Gulf they're holding up local
economies trade and Investments are also important the India UA trade is around $85
billion the India Qatar trade is worth $20 billion a big chunk of that is LNG
that's liquified natural gas around 48% of India's LNG Imports are from Qatar
almost half and last week both sides renewed a deal India will keep importing
LNG from qar until 20 48 that's the deal it's a massive energy
deal worth $78 billion so there's a strong Foundation
to the Diplomatic ties yes personal Outreach is help but the underlying Foundation is also good sizable trade
solid Investments and a large diaspora it's what we call a win-win relationship
the gulf gets a reliable customer India gets a foothold in a geopolitically
significant region plus it's a political statement Western media has questioned the safety
of Muslims in India but the same Indian government is celebrated in the Gulf Prime Minister Modi has received
civilian Hors from multiple Nations there like the UAE Saudi Arabia bahin and
Palestine that investment has clearly paid off because Qatar takes Espionage very seriously and spying for Israel
it's a one-way ticket to The Gallows so this release is a big diplomatic win for
India victory for quiet and mature
diplomacy and now let's turn our attention to Indonesia the biggest country in Southeast Asia home to the
biggest Muslim population in the world and the fourth most populated Nation after India China and the US this
Behemoth is days away from the biggest election on the planet on Wednesday
February 14th Indonesia will go to polls the largest single day election ever
conducted more than 205 million people are eligible to vote they will choose
their next president and government and it's the youth that will decide Indonesia's future more than half
of the electorate is under 40 years of age more than half about a third of the eligible voters are under 30 so make no
mistake this is an election for Indonesia's future and by extension the future of Asia this is a general
election Indonesians will be voting for every single level of government both the upper and the lower houses of
Parliament Regional and City level legislatures and of course their president their next president that is
the biggest and most hyped up contest Indonesia's current president is Joko
viodo popularly known as jooi he won the presidency in 2014 and he has overseen a
period of economic growth for his country his efforts have made him very popular his approval ratings have
regularly been more than 70% even towards the end of his 10e
stint he remains very popular but Jovi has to step down now his two term limit is up someone else must take over now
three candidates are vying for this job we begin with anise baswedan Jovi's
former education Minister and after that the governor of [Music]
Jakarta we do not want a country that's arrogant towards its own people we don't want a country that's greedy to its own
people we don't want a country that's inhumane towards its people we want a country that loves and protects and
helps its [Music]
people he's running for president without a party he's contesting as an independent he has vowed to safeguard
Indonesia's democracy and has a dedicated campaign staff that stands out
his four cats he's been using their videos to appeal to Indonesia's young voters after all who doesn't like cat
videos so that's anise baswan for you the first candidate next we have ganar
pranovo the ruling Party candidate we apologize for anyone hurt
by our words we hope peace can be brought by our campaigns we hope nobody takes anything to heart and that we will
closely pay attention to what the people of our nation have said we have empathy and integrity to improve Indonesia to be
as great as what our Founders wanted he is the offical IAL successor
to Jovi he has experience as the governor of Central Java and he is expected to maintain the policies and
economic momentum of the Jovi regime both these former governors have run
vibrant election campaigns but they're both currently fighting for second place
they're miles behind the front runner which is this man praboo subianto a 72y
old former General who's been dancing his way into people's hearts and to the top of opinion polls this is his third
time fighting for the presidency he twice fought and lost to Jovi in 2014 and then again in 2019 he
fought both those contests but third time could be the charm for this Earth while strongman he
has softened His Image and run a phenomenal social media campaign he's now seen as a lovable Grandpa and this
has endeared him to the Indonesian youth so how has the popular job's one-time
rival become his most likely successor his running mate holds the
answer PR Gibran and the Indonesia Mau Coalition are fighting to eliminate
poverty in the Republic of Indonesia to bring prosperity to all
Indonesians we will continue for the previous presidents of
built praboo subbiano is running with Jovi's
son jibran raaka booming raka the outgoing president has refrained from
making a direct endorsement but he's accused of tacitly backing his son over his party in this upcoming election the
most recent opinion polls show them in the lead the praboo jibran pair have more than 50% of the vote which means
they could win the presidential election outright but if they don't cross the halfway mark there will be a runoff in
June as things stand they're in the clear they should win the period for
campaigning has ended the final decision now rests with the people Wednesday we'll see the biggest election day in
the world and we'll be keeping you updated on this
story now let's talk about the Israel Hamas War it's in its fifth month casualties are mounting but Israel has a
new plan prime minister neth who wants the military to storm Gaza his Focus
this time is Rafa the Southernmost city in the Gaza Strip and the last refuge
for fleeing gazans Israel has already launched air strikes there a ground offensive may happen soon Israel's
allies want this to be called off they have issued strong warnings but Netanyahu remains steadfast he wants to
dismantle what he calls the last battalions of Kamas is that his only objective though why does he want to
storm r and why is it a red line for his allies our next report tells
you this is the city of Rafa located in the south of the Gaza Strip straddling
the border of Gaza and Egypt 3 months ago it was pegged as a safe haven the
final place of Refuge for gazans right now it's home to 1.4 million
Palestinians they have fled the war in the North and this is where they are seeking
shelter but is Rafa say anymore last week the Israeli Prime
Minister announced a new offensive this time in Rafa he asked his military to
enter the city to dismantle what he called the last Bastion of Hamas the air
strikes have already begun it targeted different parts of the city over 100 people have been killed the casualties
could rise further several people remained trapped under the rubble Israel also launched a special
operation this was to rescue hostages over 100 Israelis are still being held
hostage Israel managed to rescue two from
Rafa in a joint rescue operation of the IDF the shinb and the Police SWAT team
We rescued Lou hair and Fernando Maron who were kidnapped from near Yak by Hamas on October 7th this was a complex
rescue operation Under Fire in the heart of Rafa a full scale ground offensive is
still on the hold but nathany ahu says that it will happen soon his allies are concerned
they are warning Israel to not go ahead with it the UK says half of gaza's
population is there the Netherlands has want of Civilian casualties Saudi Arabia has want of consequences if Rafa is
stormed and the US said it will be a disaster so will the Rafa offensive be a
red line for Israel's allies Washington its strongest Ally wants Israel to come
up with an evacuation plan before it launches any offensive in the city but naanyu remains steadfast the
answer lies in his political fortunes the war is now in its fifth
month over 28,000 people have been killed half of Gaza is under Rubble
nathany who says Victory is Within Reach yet he hasn't fulfilled his primary
objective getting the hostages back home Israel has bombed hospitals in
residential areas it has uncovered Hamas tunnels yet the hostages except for the
two rescued remain Out Of Reach plus nathany who's popularity is sinking the
opposition wants him out and so do the citizens Moody has downgraded Israel's credit rating people want Nathan Yahoo
to take public responsibility for the October 7th attack by Hamas they blame him for the security f failures so the
Israeli Prime Minister is embattled to survive he needs a big win that can only
happen if the hostages return home which explains why Nathan yahu is pushing
ahead with the Rafa offensive so will it work out Rafa is
overcrowded right now any offensive would lead to hundreds of casualties and
if the hostages are there they could also lose their lives in the process plus the Allies are not enthusiastic
about the plan but the fact of the matter is they can issue all the warnings they want but Netanyahu is most
likely to go ahead with it the Israeli Prime Minister is looking for victory and Rafa seems to be his best
chance Donald Trump it's a name and headline rolled into one what's he done
this time Trump has just openly trashed America's most important Alliance NATO
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO has a lot of rules and obligations
but the most important one is this an attack on one is an attack on all I'll
give you an example assume Russia launched an attack on Germany now Germany is a NATO member so
the attack on Germany will be considered an attack on all 31 NATO members meaning
all of them will respond it won't be Germany versus Russia it will will be NATO versus
Russia that commitment is the Bedrock of this Alliance that's why Finland joined last
year why Sweden is joining this year why Ukraine refused to be neutral they all want the NATO security cover but Donald
Trump doesn't care about it this weekend he was campaigning in South Carolina and he narrated his conversation with a NATO
member listen to this well Sarah if we don't pay and we're attacked by Russia
will you protect us I said you didn't pay you're delinquent he said yes let's
say that happened no I would not protect you in fact I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want you got to
pay you got to pay your bills what does that mean it means Donald Trump won't protect a NATO member
if they're attacked not unless the country pays the bills and which bill is that well NATO members have an
unofficial military spending Target 2% of their GDP that's what they must spend
on defense 2% of their GDP but many NATO members don't hit that Target so Donald
Trump says he won't defend them in fact he goes a step ahead he says he will encourage others to attack
them again let's talk examples in fact the same example Works still Germany
Germany did not spend 2% of its GDP on defense in 2023 so Trump would encourage an attack
on Germany at least that's what he claims now European officials are in Shock after listen to Trump even top
Ally Britain is concerned let's be serious NATO cannot be a alak military
Alliance cannot be a military Alliance that works depending on the humor of the
president of the US on those days in this world where we've seen Putin's terrible illegal invasion of Ukraine and
actually NATO this year has got stronger with Sweden and Finland joining of course we want all count countries like
us to spend 2% but I think what was said was not a sensible
approach the White House has called the comments appalling the NATO Chief has also criticized them but coming from
Donald Trump it's important this is a man leading the US presidential race he
could be president by this time next year so what he says is important no matter how outlandish it may sound so
let's focus on two obvious questions number one can you really not defend a NATO member and two if the US walks away
what can Europe do let's look at Article Five of NATO that's the article dealing with Collective defense and this is what
it says if an armed attack occurs each of
the members will assist the party or party so attacked by taking such action as it deems necessary including the use
of Armed Force so military response is not
necessary Trump may decide that financial support is enough or maybe just political support and some NATO
members already do this Iceland for example Iceland does not have an armed Force so technically Iceland cannot
defend a fellow NATO member no reason Donald Trump can't do the same if he becomes president of course that the
Fallout would be huge European allies will likely tear into the Americans they
will also be humiliated and shamed now to the second question how how can Europe prepare for this frankly it's a
question the leaders should consider it's easy to condemn Trump and move on
but the fact is he represents a big chunk of us voters this is how a lot of Americans think what if they're Fed Up
of Defending Europe of being the hammer of NATO so it's a wakeup call for
European nations they can't blindly depend on the US for for security they must look out for
themselves and that's what Estonia is calling for so I think uh it still is is
the plea for for everybody to do more uh and I think what uh um the presidential
candidate in America says is also something to maybe uh wake up uh uh some
of the Allies who haven't done that much uh so hopefully hopefully we all do more and collectively uh we are stronger uh
together the numbers support this the eu's defense spending is around $260
billion that's 27 countries in total and how much does the US spend
$877 billion of course the US is a much bigger economy it's also a
self-proclaimed superpower so their requirements are different from Europe's having said that the sentiment is
Shifting Russia's invasion of Ukraine is changing things Europe is now more worried about its safety six EU
countries increase their defense spending by 10% Sweden increased by 30%
so the direction is upwards does that mean Donald Trump is right I'm afraid
it's not that simple Yes America spends more but that money also gives the US influence a lot more influence than any
other country if the money goes so will the influence which is why Donald Trump will
find it hard to walk the talk he tried NATO skepticism in his first term as
well but eventually he had to back down expect the same with this
rhetoric and now let's turn our attention to the cou hit Myanmar it's been embroiled in chaos for months now
the military hunai is losing control and with it losing ground in many parts of Myanmar including the state of rakine it
is in the grip of violence both India and Bangladesh have consulates here India has already evacuated its
officials now Bangladesh is doing the same because tensions are only escalating dating on Saturday the Hun
announced compulsory military service it will require all young men and women to serve at least 2 years but will this
solve their problems can they defeat the advancing Rebels with conscription
here's a report Myanmar has seen a turbulent past
in 2021 the military Hunter took control of the nation embroiling the nation in
[Music] chaos plunging it into a state of emergency
killing thousands displacing over a
million since October last year Myanmar has been in the grip of violence ethnic
militias have been fighting the military and in recent months the latter has faced a series of humiliating defeats at
the end of last year three ethnic Insurgent armies in the Shan State captured border crossings
these Crossings and Roads carry most of the land trade with China last month the
ethnic groups took control of PETA it was the last military Post in the strategically important Township the
rebels are in charge of all major towns and now they are fast gaining control of the state of Rakin which makes the
situation worse for the military Rakin is important from a diplomatic standpoint it borders Bangladesh and is
close to India so its capital of sway has consulates of both the Nations tension is high on the border
the surge in fighting has seen civilian casualties recently India evacuated
their officials from the irakin consulate now Bangladesh is following suit it wants to evacuate officials and
temporarily shift the consulate to Yangon so the picture isn't pretty the
hunter is losing ground its diplomatic woes are piling up its defeats and
Retreats have sparked criticis isms on Saturday the hunter made an
announcement the people's military service law enacted as law number 27201 0 of State peace and Development
Council in 2010 shall come into for starting from 10th February
2024 the hunter has enforced a compulsory military service law it
requires all men aged 18 to 35 and all women aged 18 to 26 7 to serve at least
2 years under military command Specialists such as doctors aged up to
45 must serve for 3 years no further details have been released so far but
those ignoring summons to serve can be jailed for the same period Myanmar has had a conscription
law since 2010 but it has never been enforced that is until now it is a clear
sign of the Hunter's desperation the military hopes that bigger numbers can save it can help it control the fighting
but will it work the ethnic armies are too far down the road to give up now
only time will tell if conscription can stop the advancing Rebels the biggest fear is the fighting in Myanmar could
spill [Music]
over now let's move to another state in Anarchy Sagal once known as West
Africa's basan of democracy sagal's reputation is now under threat last week we told you how the
upcoming presidential election had been postponed it was supposed to take place on February
25th but with less than 3 weeks to go president makisa postponed it it has
been pushed to December now meaning Saul Won't Give Up Power for at least a few more months and this has led to mounting
anger in Sagal that anger erupted over the
weekend if we here here it's because of President macki Saul who D to touch our constitution people are saying Sagal is
experiencing a detor it's the first time it's happened and it's under president macki he's the first president to Stage
a c here at him people started taking to the streets
on Friday and they began clashing with the police these were the scenes in the capital Dakar protesters pelting Stones
the police responding with tear gas the demonstrators were undeterred though they marched towards the security forces
proudly brandish sagal's flag and they kept
chanting they're chanting macki Saul is a dictator these protests took place
throughout the weekend in the capital Dakar and other cities at least three people have died in the violence but it
shows no sign of dying down we are ready to give our lives so
that the people can be freed so that Sagal can rid itself of
maiol the situation in Sagal has sent alarm bells ringing around the world the United Nations has weighed in asking all
stakeholders to follow the country's Constitution the West African Regional block ecoas has spoken to asking Sagal
to quote unquote urgently restore the Electoral calendar ecoas head and Nigerian president Bola ubu was set to
meet sagal's leader today but that meeting was abruptly called off there's a lot at stake for the region it has
seen a string of coups in recent years and Sagal was supposed to be the exception it's West Africa Shining Light
of democracy the most stable country in the region so macki Sal's decision to postpone the election has sent shock
waves across the region Saul however is defiant he says he has done only what
was necessary you are right that West Africa
is currently in an extremely difficult time and it's not a time that I should finish my term and reinvent myself in a
new career as a dictator or non-d democrat that's a picture they are painting but it doesn't correspond to my
profile or my personality and that doesn't correspond to reality
that's what macki Saul said in his first interview after the election delay was announced but his record doesn't really
hold up two of sagal's major opposition leaders have already been barred from the election popular youth leader called
Osman esono who's in prison and kareim V the son of a former president both barred from the polls but it seems that
wasn't enough maiol then postpone the election he said there were still electoral issues issues with the list of
presidential candidates some 20 candidates had qualified for the February
election and they're not pleased with the delay about 12 of them have come together they're uniting against maiol
and challenging the election delay in court those 12 and 13th of us what we've decided is this this is not about a
political party we decided to take away any colors from our parties there's only
one color it's Sagal we have one goal now it's to make sure that President
makis does not um conduct his third mandate and we go towards the election
One Challenge was launched on Friday another appeal was scheduled for today all against the election deal a decision
is expected this week but will maiol obey the court verdict he refuses to say
senagal is on the edge with people waiting to see if their cherished democracy will remain or if Sagal will
become the next African
dictatorship our next story is about Elon Musk the poster child of bizarre ideas musk wants to build tunnels under
cities send his car to space and engage in hand combat with Russian President Putin but like him or hate him you
cannot ignore his plans including his new plan Elon Musk now wants to colonize
Mars he wants to establish a human Colony on the red planet he says it will have 1 million settlers and how will
they reach there by his SpaceX Starship rocket but is this plan viable and can
humans really build a colony on Mars our next report
explores Lush Dome structures Chrome cable cars humans in space suits and a
cosmic commute Elon Musk has a new plan and it's to colonize the red PL planet
to create a human Colony on Mars he wants 1 million people there by 2050 of
course this isn't a first there are books about living on Mars films about life on the red planet space agencies
want to explore the idea corporations want to fund it and now Elon Musk has
come out with his game plan the first obstacle is reaching the
red planet musk has a solution he's depending on his own company SpaceX he
says the Starship could take people to Mars almost like a daily flight it sounds very life-changing but there are
a few problems with that first the Starship has its own challenges its recent flight ended in an
explosion musk says there will be a new test this year but currently progress
remains slow but for a moment let's imagine the Starship Works what happens
after that musk says the first few flights will be unmanned then people will be sent in not everyone just a
handful on the red planet they will try to convert water and carbon dioxide from the surface of Mars and turn it into
liquid oxygen and methane this fuel will power the starship's return journey to
Earth after that musk plans to send more people in the thousands they will have
only one job build colonies and factories this is to make the red planet
self- sustaining there was also the talk of giant glass does to try and heat up the planet of course all this sounds
very sci-fi but is it legitimately possible the first problem is the
atmosphere on Mars musk wants to terraform the planet it's a process to
make the planet warmer and wetter much like our own planet Earth but is it really possible scientists say they
don't know if Mars has enough carbon dioxide to achieve that the other problem is getting people there musk is
living on the assumption that people people want to leave planet Earth but why would they life on Earth may have
its fair share of problems but it isn't bad enough to take a rocket to Mars musk
wants to put the first person on Mars by 2029 but Starship hasn't yet left the
Earth's orbit without blowing up and even if people do get there no one knows
how they will sustain themselves there we know very little about the long-term effects space has on the body nobody has
spent time in space for more than 437 days in a row so how do you expect them
to stay on Ms permanently there are also questions about gravity and how the human body will adapt without it forget
Interstellar fashion space suits will be your best friend you will be in the chunky gear day in and day out unless
you're in the Starship then there's the question of basic necessities like food and water at
least at the start they will have to be shipped from Earth and that will have a hefty cost so the mission sounds great
at least as a headline but challenges Loom over the idea Elon Musk may want to do it but his Martian Escapade still has
some big
loopholes what is the foolproof method to learn a language language professionals are often asked this
question their answers defer some say practice speaking with a friend others suggest visit the country and fall in
love with the language there is no singular right answer here but most recommendations share a common thread
the one thing that is crucial to learn anything motivation the desire to do things study
after study tells us how to stay motivated look at maso's hierarchy of of
needs you may remember this from school this is a theory of motivation it shows
five areas of human needs that dictate how motivated we stay at the basic level
is psychological needs for example if you're hungry you're motivated to find food then come safety belonging esteem
and self-actualization needs but if you aren't much for studies there are motivational speakers the global market
for motivational speakers is reportedly worth $7 billion beat that but if you
want to avoid the hassle there are YouTube videos Tik toks and reals and if you aren't motivated enough to listen to
those either there are motivational posters WhatsApp forwards videos mug stationary because the business of
motivation is massive and the market seems ever expanding according to a recent Global
survey 60% 6 60% of workers feel unmotivated in their jobs especially on
Mondays pardon the pun surveys say Monday is the worst day of the week for
many millions of people the world over hate Monday days according to a 2020 study most employees feel emotionally
compromised on Mondays they have lower levels of job satisfaction high levels
of job stress and very little motivation to work that's what people call Monday blues it's when you feel down at the
start of the week but our Monday blue is a real thing scientifically
scientifically speaking they they aren't Monday blues is not a medical term according to research they are the
repercussions of weekend choices like waking up late or socializing too much
so Monday misery is actually a choice can we get a dose of Monday
motivation despite feeling the blues then scientifically how do we stay
motivated let me go back to the example of language after childhood learning a new language is hard but it can be done
some Learners who do it are internally motivated they might want to talk to a friend in their language others might be
externally motivated meaning their motivation stems from outside sources like wanting to Ace a language test in
most cases motivation is impacted by a combination of these two internal and external motives a mix that works for
you increases your chances of success and I say chances because motivation
does not promise anything let alone success most people who achieve success are strongly motivated but not everyone
who is motivated manages to succeed which is why motivation is so Elusive
and if you two find it hard to achieve here's some Monday motivation for all of you get started either way whatever you
have start people say motivation is the energy that gets us to take action but
science disagrees it says motivation is often the result of action not the cause
of it so getting started even in very small
ways is a form of actively feeling motivated if you keep waiting for motivation you might have to wait
forever and if all else fails you can always leave Post-it notes everywhere telling you to just do
it and now it's time for Vantage shots images that tell the story Rio de Janeiro is in party mode as the world's
biggest carnival kicks off with elaborate parades and dances in Hong Kong fireworks light up the Victoria
Harbor to Mark the Luna New Year and it was a Super Bowl Sunday for America as
