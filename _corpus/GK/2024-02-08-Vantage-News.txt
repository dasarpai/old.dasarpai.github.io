hello namaskar this is first post and you're watching vantage with me py
Sharma today Pakistan voted and the rest of the
world wondered why it was an election out of the raval pindy Playbook no
mobile services low turnout and in infinite delays most opposition parties
have complained of rigging in some places voters were turned back after ballot paper ran out so looks like the
Army got what it wanted a grand selection dressed up as an election the

online retailers like Amazon and amid the flight tracking drama pop
star Taylor Swift sells one of her two private jets just days ago she had sent a legal notice to a college student for
tracking her planes in 2022 Swift topped the list of celebrities with the highest
carbon emissions hold this
today we saw a Master Class A lesson on how not to hold an
election a dismal turnout long delays and a mobile service shut down you name
it Pakistan's election had it the day began with some expected News Mobile Services were shut down across the
country why do I say expected because how else can you rig an election polls
opened at 8 8:00 a.m. local time some 128 million pakistanis were eligible to
vote slowly they started trickling in look at the scenes in Karachi it's the
biggest city in Pakistan also the country's commercial Capital turnout was slow to pick up there in these pictures
you can see more soldiers than voters and the scenes were similar in
other cities as well like Islamabad and queta many voters also complained of
difficulties like NeverEnding delays and insufficient poll officers inefficient
poll officers processes are very slow and I I think this the the untr
unprofessional people are just sitting there we facing internet issues it is
hard to call our voters a few people are coming to vote we did not expect a suspension of mobile and internet
services we have been standing in this line for almost two hours now there are no lists like previous elections they're
sending voters here and there sometimes to number eight sometimes to number three it is a total
chaos the biggest worry was security we saw multiple attacks on Election offices
yesterday two of them were quite serious this happened in baluchistan both explosions targeted candidate officers
they killed around 28 people later the Islamic State claimed responsibility for it so the fear was today would be worse
that more attacks would follow today it was not that bad we did not see violence on a national level in Pakistan today
only a handful of attacks were reported one of them was in kber Pak a Bomb Blast
targeted a police Convoy in der is Khan four cops were killed in balistan
grenade attacks were reported they killed two security Personnel in the rest of the country things were largely
stable you can write that down to security presence some 650,000 Personnel
had been deployed 650,000 security officials so the whole country was in
lockdown even the borders with Iran and Afghanistan were shut same with mobile services last week there was speculation
about a shutdown but Pakistan's Telecom regulator denied it they said no shutdown was being planned yet this
morning they switched it off all mobile services across the country were stopped today basically Pakistan went dark
candidates could not speak to their supporters parties could not coordinate with voters it was a list iCal nightmare
the question is why why shut down mobile services on Election Day apparently to
keep the security situation under check but let's face it the shutdown was a rigging tactic no mobile service equals
no scrutiny it also exposed who stands where belaval B of the Pakistan People's
Party opposed it he said lift the mobile
shutdown so the mobile phone services should be immediately restored for the sake of security democracy and normal
functionality this is the basic right of the Pakistani people they must cast their votes today and this block can
cause impediments to that well he's asked for this so did
workers of Imran Khan's PTI they said their whole network had been crippled
but guess who did not complain Naas Sharie the man touted to be the next prime minister of Pakistan he cast his
vote at a polling station in Lor he was accompanied by his daughter Mariam Nawaz Sharif says the election was truly
Fair now today his Rivals to cast their vote
belaval B at a polling station in larana and Imran Khan via postal ballot chances
are that postal vote did not leave jail premises now all of these developments
would discourage any voter it would make them lose faith in democracy but thousands of Pakistani voters still
turned up today they knew the polls were rigged they knew their vote may not matter yet they turned up at the polling
station we came here today by foot and then on a tractor trolley it was a very
difficult and hard journey we have no school in our village the young girls have to travel far away for
studies I feel very excited to cast my first vote um and because you know every
one votes waits for their first vote uh and um I think it's like a good
experience voting does matter everyone should come out everyone no one should
stay at home today is not the day to stay at home those who choose to sit at home today will do Injustice to
themselves I came to vote for good government a good economy and for a good image of Pakistan abroad and for the
good future of our children what do you call that misplaced
optimism net or something else whatever it is Pakistan's Army throttled it they
used a number of tactics to rig the voting today delays were one of them
voters said pole officers were moving at a snail space so the lines barely moved
in some places voting started very late or never started at all like at a polling station in Karachi polling
station number 81 even at 2: p.m. voting was yet to
start there how about that 6 hours into voting polling stations were shut
elsewhere ballot paper ran out so voters were turned back they were told you cannot cast your vote PTI supporters
were protesting throughout the day they have complained of widespread rigging yet Pakistan expects the world to take
this election seriously we knew the process would be rigged we knew the Army would try everything but but today's
election went one step ahead it wasn't just subversion of democracy it was an
allout murder and all of this was in unexpected
lines candidates have held rallies voters have cast their ballots behind the scenes the Pakistani army is pulling
the strings you've probably heard this a million times the result will be announced later tonight or tomorrow but
we already know the name of the winner and that is nawas Sharif but how did the military make
sure that Sharif wins how did they rig the vote a few days ago a letter began doing
the rounds in Pakistan it was written by a local election officer this was a
letter of complaint and who was it addressed to Pakistan's Election Commission this officer had a concern
the election commission uses a software an election management
system and it was behaving the system was behaving living in an odd way the officer had specific complaints data on
the software was being deleted some staffers were assigned duties on it but
soon after the records were updated this data vanished and when this problem came to
light the officer did what anyone would do call for it support a technical team
looked into the problem and like most it support teams they could not solve it
they said it was probably a technical glitch and the election officer was asked to continue using the software but
the officer was not convinced the team using the software faced trouble too so together they reported their problems
they expressed their reservations again no solution was offered the tech team asked the election
officers to keep going to keep using the same faulty software finally this officer decided to
write a complaint letter and we have a copy of the letter in fact let me read out a section of of the letter to you
and listen to this very carefully this is what it says this weakness of the system has created many issues and also
raises a question mark on the reliability and validity of the tool or
software this shows that either the election management system is an utter failure or and listen to this there is
someone else that controls and manages a system behind the
veil so someone else is in control he says or that's what he's suggesting who could be pulling the string strings from
behind this system belongs to a government Department Pakistan's National Data based registration
Authority or nadra they're supposed to be an independent and autonomous agency
and what is their job to maintain the database of all citizens like population data demographic files and most
importantly voter roles they maintain all of this now nadra has an important role to play in this election it
controls all the systems used to administer the election and transmit the
results this agency is like a referee in a football match their task is to call
out who has hit the goal in the election match now usually this referee is a civilian but last year there was a
sudden change in their leadership instead of a civilian official a serving
general of the Pakistan Army was giving given charge of nadra which begs the question why is a
serving general in charge of Pak Pakistan's voter roles and it's not really rocket science
to figure out the answer the Army put their own man in the driver's seat to ensure a favorable
outcome last month there was another complaint it came from a member of the PPP the Pakistan People's Party led by
the BH zardari now they had raised objections to nadra systems one of their lawmakers
had written a letter it said the party has quote unquote serious objections to the systems Pakistan's election
commission responded it played down the risk of manipulation but at this point it's really hard to take any Assurance
at face value it's like the Army is not even bothering to hide how it is rigging the
election so from military coups to silent coups to Brazen selection of
prime ministers this is how Pakistan's sham democracy has progressed under the
Army there's trouble for the Mal the international monetary fund has warned its government and what is the warning
be careful of your debt it's a timely warning for president Muhammad muu he's
been revamping maldivian foreign policy India out China in that is his Mantra
that's mizu's new policy India out China in and China as we know is the biggest lone shark in
town so how will this equation work out we'll get to that in a bit but first
let's look at the IMF warning here's what the international monetary fund has said and I'm quoting without
significant policy changes the overall fiscal deficits and public debt are projected to stay
elevated and the Maldives remains at high risk of external and overall debt
distress let me underline those words high risk of debt
distress you know what that means it means your loans and liabilities are way too much you could soon be unable to
make payments in other words a default is a possibility the Maldives is at high
risk of that situation and how much debt are we talking about in 2021 their external
debt was around $3 billion the Malian GDP is all of 5.4 billion external debt
is 3 billion so the foreign debt is 55% of
the national GDP total debt is even higher almost 110% of the GDP
and where is China figure in this Beijing is the biggest lender to the Maldives they owe
42% of their foreign debt to China which is around $1.2
billion and that's a lot of money for the males higher debt also means higher servicing
costs this year Mali will have to spend $300 million on debt
servicing basically interest and repayment $300 million by 20 26 that number could reach
$1.07 billion in other words distress this data raises two important
questions number one how did Mali rack up this debt and number two what is mizu's plan to pay it
back to be fair these loans predate him the Chinese debt was mostly taken during
Abdullah yamin's presidency he was in power from 2013 to 2018 Yamin 2 was pro-china so he took a
lot of loans from Beijing then came the Wuhan virus pandemic Mal's top source of income was shut down that's tourism it
makes up 25% of the national GDP also 32% of all jobs in the
males but there was no tourism in during the lockdown so when tourism disappeared so did income at the same time expenses
kept increasing more medical spending more vaccine purchases more money for doctors and nurses all of this required
additional loans which is why Malian debt is so high
today now we come to the second question what is mizu's repayment
plan to kzy up to China believe it or not last month he traveled to Beijing he held talks with President Xi Jinping
some 20 deals were signed by the two leaders they cover a lot of different sectors like infrastructure tourism
climate resilience and a whole lot of others but that's all we know we don't
know how much money is coming in when it's coming in or whether it's loans or
grants in what form is this money coming the deals are shrouded in secrecy but after the trip to Beijing
muu did make an announcement he said a Chinese technical team would visit the Maldives what for to consider
restructuring loans we haven't heard any update on
that but we've seen how the Chinese negotiate they play hard ball in Sri
Lanka people did not have fuel to run ambulances the country had virtually collapsed but even then China played
hard ball President muu should be mindful of all of that China's debt and help always always comes with strings
attached we we are already seeing evidence of that a Chinese spy ship
reached the Maldives today Mal says it's a routine Voyage no researcher studying
just replenishments but China hinted it could be more
over the years China and Maldives have maintained close cooperation in the field of marine scientific research
China appreciate males's decision according to relevant regulations in international law and based on
sovereignity and China Maldives friendship to provide convenience and assistance for Chinese research vessels
to enter its Port so the ball is now in muu court he
knows the numbers I'm sure he's heard the IMF warning does he still want to
get closer to China or does he want to keep his options open at the end of the day it is his
call he is the president but at stake is the livelihood of half a million
maldivians now here is what the Maldives gets wrong you cannot grow your economy
by betting on a few big players growth requires opening up case in point India
it is on the verge of sealing a major trade deal India could get $100 billion
in investment from Europe and the deal could be signed by April discussions are in the final stage
and this proposed agreement with Europe stands out for multiple reasons typically in a classic trade deal
countries remove trade barriers by reducing taxes this tends to boost Import and Export but what India is
negotiating with Europe is different under this deal New Delhi is willing to
open up its markets but at a price tag of $100 billion this money will flow in
the form of Investments and this will happen over a period of 15 years the PCT guarantees this investment
and that's a rare feature trade deals rarely come with a binding clause on
investments and where is this money coming from a special block of European nations four countries are part of it
Norway Iceland lyen Stein and Switzerland together they called the
efta the European free trade Association currently it's this block that is
negotiating with India not the entire European Union just this block but this block could set a template for the
future something that the rest of the region could choose to replicate next question what kind of
Investments are they eyeing and where will this will this1 billion go for now
one area has been identified new and existing manufacturing projects they
could be state entities or private players this investment has the potential to generate over 1 million
jobs but for India the benefits of this deal go beyond the money and the jobs for instance more visas are on
offer if the deal goes through Indian professionals could get easy access to these four countries Norway Iceland lyen
Stein and Switzerland and what do these countries get in return what what's in it for them
like I said they're looking for Market access say they want to sell a range of products in
India look at this list processed food and beverages electrical Machinery
engineering products also pharmaceutical and medical devices with this trade deal they'll be
able to sell all these products and more most likely at reduced tariffs obviously we'll have to wait for
the fine print but on First Impressions this deal has big benefits for both sides and the agreement has been in the
making for a long time in fact the conversation started way back in 2008 so it has taken some 16 years for India and
the efta this European block to finalize a deal and it hasn't been signed yet the
European side wants to sign the pact before the general election in India but
is New Delhi on the same page Reports say the outline of the deal was locked last month there is an agreement on
pressing and controversial issues like patent protection they've all been sorted they just have to tie some lose
ends because New Delhi too would like to lock this up soon in fact this is not the only trade
pact in the pipeline Reports say India is holding discussions with as many as 50 countries 5-0 these talks are
happening both at the bilateral level and the Block Level it remains to be seen how many of these conversations
lead to actual agreements but one thing is quite clear India is sending a signal to the world India is open for
business Nvidia versus Amazon it's a race that
makes little sense on paper because these two companies are not Rivals they do not even sell the same things nor are
they in the same industry but Market experts are making this comparison do you know why because
it's a sign of our times Nvidia is a semiconductor maker based in the United
States Amazon is an e-commerce giant both companies were founded in the 1990s
but in the last two decades one was a clear leader and that's Amazon maybe not
for long though Nvidia is on the brink of overtaking it Amazon has a market valuation of $ 1.77 trillion Nvidia is
at 1.73 trillion its Shares are up 40% this year 40 40% imagine that 40% up in
just under 40 days at this rate it will overtake Amazon one of the biggest companies of
our times what does this signify what many experts have been
saying for a while chips are the new oil especially artificial intelligence chips
every major tech company is on the AI train and AI needs very Advanced
chips and who's making those chips mostly Nvidia the company is set to make
up 85% of this Market just look at their list of customers Microsoft meta Google Amazon
Oracle tensent Buu Alibaba Tesla B Dan most big Tech firms buy chips from
Nvidia so sales are through the roof I have numbers from the last quarter nvidia's Revenue was $18
billion it tripled from the year before and profits around $9.2 billion that's
14 times higher than the year before so Nvidia is on a roll which is why we are
taking a closer look at this company tonight it was founded by three American Computer scientists in 1993 all three
came from Chip companies one from AMD one from Sun Microsystems and one from
IBM Jensen Huang was one of the co-founders today he serves as Nvidia
CEO the company first focused on computer video games these games needed
3D Graphics so Nvidia made cutting a chips it became their USP other chip firms
were selling computer shooting chips Nvidia was selling graphic cards that set them apart that was their
USB like I said in 1999 the company went public the same year they launched a new
product the ge4 256 it was a major leap in 3D
gaming all these Milestones caught the attention of Microsoft they asked Nvidia to develop the hardware for Xbox that's
Microsoft's gaming console it was a big deal for NVIDIA the company was paid $200 million
upfront then came the 2000s Nvidia started to diversify in 2003 they
collaborated with NASA they began making chips from for Audi cars in 2007 Forbes declared IT company
of the year so Nvidia had truly arrived and around this time they
started focusing on AI it was a bit accidental Nvidia had put a lot of focus
on Parallel Computing technology think of it as a multitask asking feature for
chips the same technology is key in artificial intelligence so Nvidia had a
head start now we don't know why the company focused on this technology maybe it was
foresight maybe it was a business strategy but whatever it was it worked today Nvidia is in Pole Position they
have a partnership with carmaker Toyota the plan is to use Nvidia chips in self-driving
vehicles but the crowning moment was in late 2022 that's when Chad GPT hit the market
everyone wanted to know how it was built turns out Chad GPT was built on
10,000 Nvidia chips soon every Tech firm rushed for it
they did not want to be left behind in the AI race and that meant buying Nvidia chips of course some of this attention
has backfired too because last year the US government asked Nvidia to stop selling high-end chips to China
Washington said it was a national security concern but for NVIDIA it was a blow
because they had orders worth $5 billion from China orders that they could not fulfill
now but looking at these numbers their revenue and their profits Nvidia is doing just fine they have a borderline
Monopoly on these AI chips and that is hard to beat you see chips keep evolving they
keep getting better with time so by the time Rivals match Nvidia Nvidia will be
two steps ahead hopefully it's all about who has
the Head Start also who doesn't become complacent so remember this company's
name it's not just a graphics maker anymore it could be the foundation of the AI age 

now we are just months away from the US presidential election campaigning is picking Pace but it's hard to make sense
of what's going on on the Republican end we have Donald Trump and Nikki Haley Trump is busy dealing with his multiple
court cases Haley on the other hand is struggling and she's talking about India Niki Haley says India sees the us as
weak and that is why it's stuck with Russia which doesn't make sense at all but that seems to be the trend here a
lot of things are not making sense in this presidential election look at the Democrat camp we
have US President Joe Biden fighting for another term in the white house but does he even remember that I ask because he's
been having a lot of trouble on that front he's forgetting and mixing up names in a recent press conference he
forgot the name of Hamas a few days back he confused macron with a previous French president our next report tells
you more I mean I think the cause of the Civil War was it's not a good time for Nikki Haley she's one of the Republican
presidential candidates but it's like she's hard on the ballot that's because she's running against Donald Trump in
Nevada she had a stinging loss she lost against no one Trump wasn't even on the
ballot she had no competition and even then she didn't win so it's difficult for Nikki Haley but the former un
Ambassador is pushing on she's continuing with her White House campaign and now she's talking about India she
claims New Delhi wants to partner with the us but it doesn't trust Americans to lead she says India played smart and
that's why it chose to stay with Russia she said and I quote I have dealt with India too I have got to say I have dealt
with India too I have talked with Modi India wants to be a partner with us they don't want to be a partner with
Russia now Haley said all of this in a campaign interview but the important issue here is the mention of India it's
featuring in the US presidential campaign Haley herself is of Indian origin her parents moved to the US from
India she's hardly talked about her Indian Heritage but looks like she's not shying away from mentioning the country
now so Nikki Haley is talking about India but on the Democrat side no one
knows what Joe Biden is talking about it's been just one week but he's already made three gaps the first involved the
French President he confused Emmanuel macron with Fran miton France's long
dead former leader today he mixed up two other European leaders
he confused former German Chancellor Angela Mel with another former Chancellor helmet Cole who's also dead
you would wish that's all but it doesn't end there in a recent press conference he forgot the name of Hamas he was asked
about the hostage negotiations and Biden just couldn't remember the name of the group he stuttered multiple times before
a reporter jumped in to name Hamas words there's some movement there's been a
response from the opposition but
um yes I'm sorry from Hamas but it seems to be uh a little over the top we're not
sure where it is there's a continuing negotiation right now this isn't the first time this has happened it's been a
worry for the Democrats Biden is already 81 years old the oldest serving US
president if he wins he will take office at 82 years and when he finish finishes the term he will be 886 years old on the
other side there's Donald Trump he's no spring chicken at 77 and he is facing a
series of Criminal trials 2024 is likely to be a 2020 rematch and that's the poor
choice that America is left
with and if one issue will dominate the discourse in this American election it's going to be Russia Biden will campaign
on his response to the war in Ukraine and his efforts to isolate Russia on the world stage but the numbers tell a
different story despite the war and sanctions the Russian economy is still
growing in fact Russia's economy has performed better than some of its Western Rivals especially the major
players like the United Kingdom and Germany Russia is doing better than them so what's driving Russia's economic
resilience and why is the West lagging behind a sanctions hit Russia our next
report explores in December a confident Putin
faced the press this was his first press conference since his forces invaded Ukraine the Russian president was asked
about the economy and he shared a prediction the most important indicator
of economic growth is a growth of gross domestic product by the end of the year it is expected to be
3.5% that's a good indicator it means we have bounced back from last year
decline the latest economic numbers are out last year Russia's economy expanded
by 3.6% Putin was off by a mere 0.1% but broadly his prediction was on
the mark since the invasion of Ukraine the West has launched a campaign to isolate
Russia mostly through a slew of sanctions but Russia's economy has shown
remarkable resilience the war gave Russia a boost in the last 2 years
Russia's industrial output has shot up by over 60% this has bumped up the
growth numbers the IMF is taking note the agency has issued a new assessment it
raises Russia's growth Outlook the IMF thinks if Russia can maintain the momentum its GDP Will Rise by
2.6% that number surpasses Russia's own predictions in November Russia's Central
Bank had put out a more conservative estimate it pegged Russia's growth to hover around 1% 0.5% in a worst case
scenario and 1.5% under better circumstances IMF numbers suggest that
Russia could do better for the Russian president his country has prevailed over its Western
Rivals the West predicted as you know recession failure collapse that under the pressure of sanctions we would
Retreat surrender fall apart I would like to show a well-known gesture but I don't know but I won't do that are a lot
of women here they won't succeed for the moment Russia has indeed
edged ahead compare Russia's growth numbers with the G7 a group that Russia
was kicked out of following the annexation of Crimea surprisingly Russia outperforms every single G7 member
Russia's arch rival the United States is growing at less than 3% Japan and Canada's economies are
expanding at less than 2% France Italy and the UK less than 1% Germany is right
at the bottom and in negative territory can Russia sustain similar levels of growth in the absence of a war the jury
is still out on that one but for the moment Moscow has managed to survive the onslaught of Western
sanctions it's day 125 of the Israel Hamas War 27,000 people killed over
65,000 injured half of Gaza is a mound of rubble but Israeli Prime Minister Benin
Netanyahu is not done yet he has he was offered a ceasefire deal Hamas proposed
a pause in fighting along with exchange of hostages Israel was expected to come up with its own counter offer but prime
minister Netanyahu has rejected the deal he described the terms as quot un quote bizarre and he has vowed to fight until
complete Victory but but what is complete Victory and what will it cost the region and the
world also will netanyahu's allies support this dismissal here's a
report Israel's war with Hamas has dragged into its fifth month the Deb
toll is rising 139 hostages remain in Hamas captivity diplomacy continues
behind doors but Benyamin Netanyahu has won jective destroying Hamas no matter
what the cost the Israeli Prime Minister has
rejected a new ceasefire proposal it came from Hamas it reportedly had three
phases phase one included a 45-day pause in fighting Israeli hostages would be
exchanged for Palestinian prisoners mainly women and children Israeli forces
would withdraw from Gaza and reconstruction of hospitals would begin
then there's phase two remaining Israeli male hostages would be exchanged Israeli
forces would leave Gaza and in phase three both sides would exchange remains and
bodies the deal would see a 135 day pause in fighting Aid would enter Gaza
injured would get medical treatment and the strip would get some respite especially after 125 days of
conflict we have now given our responses to our brothers in Qatar and Egypt on their part they have handed it over to
the Americans and handed it over to the other party now we're waiting for the response of the other side we hope that
God willing this matter will go on I mean now people are waiting for what will be the response of the other
party so Hamas came up with a proposal Israel was expected to come up with its
own proposal something to counter hamas's initial terms but Netanyahu has
now outrightly rejected their terms he has called them
bizarre there is no solution other than total Victory if Hamas survives in Gaza it is only a matter of time until the
next Massacre and the axess of evil of Iran and its proxies will continue its campaign of killing and aggression
without interruption only a total Victory will allow us to restore Security in Israel both in the north and
in the South so Netanyahu says Victory will
come but the question is at what cost meanwhile the Israeli Prime Minister
ordered troops to move into Rafa it is the biggest city in gaza's far south one
million Palestinians are seeking Refuge there a military operation could spell disaster but Netanyahu is pressing on
but his actions aren't going down too well both with his allies and with the
people of Israel let's look at the Allies first support for Israel's war is
waning ceasefire is the need of the R Us Secretary of State is already in West
Asia he even met the Israeli Prime Minister discussions are underway they
are being mediated by Egypt andq blinkin hoped for a breakthrough here but all he got was netanyahu's rejection and it
could be seen as a snub but the US Secretary of State says there is still hope what I can tell you about these
discussions is that while there are some clear non-starters in hamas's response
uh we do think it creates space for agreement to be reached and we will work at that
relentlessly until we get there as for the people of Israel they want the hostages back home Netanyahu says ending
Hamas is the best way to get them back but the citizens don't agree which explains why the Israeli Prime Minister
is losing popularity when the war started Israelis backed the military action but 5 months in all they care
about is the fate of the hostages they believe the only feasible option to free the hostages is to strike another to
deal with Hamas something Netanyahu refuses to do right now so what happens
next Hamas has proposed a ceasefire naanyu says no he believes a win will
come even if it takes months but what does a complete Victory even mean does
it mean saving the hostages or just ending Hamas naanyu may have rejected it now
but as calls for a ceas fire grow louder how long can the Israeli Prime Minister ignore
it a phone call after you have left work an
email you need to check on a Sunday a new project that haunts you during a vacation work is increasingly seeping
into home life and the world over people are braving it but in Australia this
could soon be outlawed Australia is set to pass a new law it is called the right to disconnect
it will give workers the right to their after hours they will be able to ignore calls and emails from their bosses
outside of work hours without any penalty and if the employees breach this
rule they will have to pay Hefty fines you see Australians work an average of 6 weeks unpaid overtime each
year in terms of unpaid wages that is more than $60 billion so the message
here is quite simple if someone is not being paid for all 24 hours a day they should not be penalized for not being
available all day most Australians are happy to hear this well I think it's a
wonderful idea I think we need to have our switch off time we all need to relax we all need to be able to switch off and not be disturbed by emails and phone
calls in the middle of the night and I both my kids are lawyers as well so they they sort of work horrendous hours as it
is and you get things coming in at night time you we need we all need to be able to switch off and relax and we're not
machines we're people in general I think the idea that you should be able to
switch off when you get to the end of your work day and when you're um at home
doing your own thing over the weekend or on leave that seems like a generally pretty reasonable thing to
me the government is on the same page hoping that the bill would restore a healthy work life balance the land down
under is not alone here several countries are staunch advocates for the right to disconnect European countries
are acing this game France is famous for its 35-hour work week on top of this it
pioneered the right to disconnect way back in 27 17 Italy Belgium Spain and
Ireland followed suit Portugal became a recent Edition in 2021 all these countries have laws protecting employees
after after their work employee after hours but the specifics differ in France
all employees can ignore calls after working hours in Belgium the right is
afforded to government workers in Portugal the rule applies to companies with over 10
employees meanwhile outside your Europe the situation is tricky in Canada only the province of Ontario has such a
policy in the African nation of Kenya a maximum of 52 hours of work per week is
mandated but during the pandemic work ballooned past this so lawmakers
proposed a bill for the right to disconnect it has become a heated issue in the country but so far no progress
has been made and that's something that India and the US can relate to in 2018
the right to disconnect bill was introduced in India's loksabha the lower House of the Indian
Parliament this bill proposed that no disciplinary action can be taken if an employee does not respond after working
hours the bill was not passed during the same year New York City proposed a
similar bill it did not pass either since then the debate has not found widespread Traction in either country
and it's not hard to understand why with the Advent of Smartphones work culture has switched to an always on on mode
there is Perpetual fear of missing an urgent work text or an important update
to many it feels like a compulsion experts call it the availability
creep where workers feel the need to be available all the time to keep up with their
workloads and like most things the pandemic made this worse boundaries between work and Leisure were were not
strong to begin with pandemic induced remote work first further eroded
them according to the world average workers are putting in longer extra
hours and this is the worst among those aged between 18 and
34 they put in over eight extra hours of free work per week this includes staying
in late or answering emails from home outside work hours yet for many workers
Detachment from work is the toxic trait it can mean that you're lazy or
disinterested it may hinder professional growth and this is the result a third of
workers say they find it difficult to unplug from work the world over research shows that it makes employees unhappier
less motivated and even sick according to the World Health Organization working more than 55 hours
a week even raises the risk of death which is alarming and the right to disconnect makes us think about all of
this it doesn't just revolutionize our schedules it changes how we look at work
and if there is a Promised Land of work life balance this could be another Stone on the road that leads to it so one day we might see our time as
ours and now let's turn our attention to Italy it is wrestling with a bear problem this week a forest bear was
killed in Northern Italy by members of the forestry core he was deemed
dangerous to humans and showed apparently excessive confidence that's
the term they use the bear showed excessive confidence authorities killed him now many Italians are not taking
this well animal rights activists are protesting the environment Minister has questioned the culling but Italy is
hardly the only one with this problem Romania cannot bear its Rising bare
attacks either in Japan be attacks are at a record high research says attacks
have increased significantly over the past two decades the world over but the reasons differ from country to Country
our next report brings you more bears are crucial for the
environment they are ecosystem Engineers they help spread seeds strip
bark from trees clean up carcasses they also control populations
of prey species like deer this allows more plants to thrive thanks to Bears species across
the food chain benefit so when bare populations decline
it makes sense that people would Panic this happened in the Alps around the mid 1990s when brown bears became
functionally extinct only a handful were remaining all of them in trentino a
mountainous City in Northern Italy so the European Union stepped in
between 1996 and 2004 it funded two projects the aim was to reverse the
Decline and to save the species so 10 bears were brought in from Slovenia their population was monitored
and now there are over 100 bears in the region twice the number the scientists had hoped for So the plan was successful
and hugely popular when it started 75% of Italians showed
support but now sentiments have changed this is a classic case of too much of a
good thing Bears have become a problem for for Italy in 2005 a bear wandered
into Germany in 2008 another entered Switzerland both were killed last year
two bears were found dead in Italy in the same year another bear mauled a 26-year-old to death the same bear
attacked two hikers in 2020 as well the matter has now reached the courts
authorities wanted killed activists want to transfer to Romania among many such legal battles
this week authorities killed a bear in Northern Italy they claim it was becoming dangerous to
humans it allegedly followed people on three occasions and exhibited quote unquote excessive confidence but its
sculling has sparked outrage among protesters who say the action was too Swift now the Italian environment
Minister has questioned the decision but Italy is hardly the only one battling the bear problem between 201 and 2015
there were over 600 bear attacks the world over with the highest numbers in Europe and
America but over time the attacks have only increased in fact bear attacks rank
the highest in a list of attacks on humans by different species and 9% of bear attacks proved
fatal an experiment may have contributed to this in Italy but there are two big
reasons for bear attacks worldwide one is climate change with a warming Planet
animals are fast losing their natural habitats and encroaching on urban areas this can be seen in Romania the bear
capital of Europe it has over 6,000 Bears between 2016 and 2021 there were
154 bear attacks on humans the second reason behind attacks
is a decrease in the density of humans we see this in Japan it has an aging
population now some prefectures in mountainous regions are sparsely populated and last year bear attacks in
Japan reached a record high numbers exceeded 200 attacks for the first
time but despite the varying reasons one thing is common across Nations the
situation is dramatic and dangerous and governments need to act fast before the situation becomes too difficult to
bear and now it's time for Vantage shots images that tell the story in Iceland a volcano in the country's Southwest
