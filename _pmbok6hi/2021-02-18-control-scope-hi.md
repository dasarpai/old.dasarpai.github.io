## कार्यक्षेत्र नियंत्रण

Control scope is a monitoring and controlling process. In any project especially large, complex, long duration, distributed team project it is possible that changes will go out of control. If the project management team is not able to manage and control the changes then no matter how good your project resources are you will never be able to complete the project successfully. This process is about managing and controlling all the scope and requirement changes. PMBOK’s focus is to emphasize that commit your deliverables and deliver whatever has been committed. It does not encourage project managers to deliver anything more or less than committed. **Anything which is not committed if you are trying to deliver it is called gold-plating.** Anything which is committed and you do not deliver it is called over-committed or under delivery. Project managers must know how many [change request](/pmbok6/change-request) were rejected and why, how many change requests were accepted, and why? What are the requirements stability and delivery status of the project? This process helps you in achieving all this.

Being monitoring and controlling process important outputs of this process are metrics related to scope and requirements. If any course correction is required in the project then that can lead to raising <a href="">change request</a>.
