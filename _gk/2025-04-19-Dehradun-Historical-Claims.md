# Fact-Checking the History of Dehradun: An Expert Report

## 1. Introduction 
Dehradun, the provisional capital of Uttarakhand, nestled in the Doon Valley at the foothills of the Himalayas, boasts a rich and multifaceted history. Its strategic geographical location has made it a significant region throughout various periods of Indian history, attracting diverse influences from ancient kingdoms to the British Raj. This report aims to meticulously examine a series of historical claims about Dehradun, utilizing provided research materials to verify their accuracy and offer a comprehensive understanding of the city's past.

## 2. Fact-Check of Claims
### 2.1. Claim 1: The city was sold in 1611 for Rs 3005.
Examination of the historical records does not support the assertion that the city of Dehradun was sold for Rs 3005 in 1611. While the provided snippets cover various aspects of Dehradun's history, none mention a transaction of this nature occurring in that specific year. Notably, one document from Garhwal Post details a purchase in 1810 where Hyder Jung Hearsey (later known as Captain Young Hearsey) bought the regions of Doon and Chandee from Raja Sudarshan Shah for the sum of 3005 rupees. This transaction, however, took place nearly two centuries after the claimed sale and involved a specific individual rather than the entire city being sold. Furthermore, this purchase occurred while Dehradun was under the control of the Gorkhas, highlighting a complex situation of ownership and authority in the region at the time. The Chand dynasty, as noted in one of the snippets , captured the Terai region, including Dehradun, between 1591 and 1611, indicating a period of conquest rather than sale. Therefore, the claim of a sale in 1611 for the mentioned amount appears to be historically inaccurate based on the available information.

### 2.2. Claim 2: Before 1674 Dehradun was named Prithvipur.
Historical accounts suggest a potential connection between the name Prithvipur and the region of Dehradun before 1674. One snippet explicitly states that Dehradun was named Prithvipur before 1674. Further supporting this, historical records indicate the existence of a township named Prithvipur within the Doon Valley, possibly named in honor of King Prithvi Pat Shah, who ruled the Garhwal Kingdom during two separate periods: 1552-1614 and later, as some sources suggest, 1631-1660. The construction of a township bearing this name by the king implies a significant presence and recognition of "Prithvipur" within the broader Dehradun area. Even as late as 1804, during the Battle of Khurbura, a figure named Miya Dulal Singh of Prithvipur is mentioned , indicating the name's continued relevance for at least a part of the region. While it's plausible that "Prithvipur" might have been a specific area or an earlier name for a significant part of what later became known as Dehradun, it requires careful distinction from whether the entire city was exclusively known by this name before 1674. The emergence of the name Dehradun is linked to the arrival of Guru Ram Rai in the late 17th century , suggesting a gradual shift in nomenclature.

### 2.3. Claim 3: In 1676 Mughal emperor Aurangzeb gifted Dehradun to Sh Guru Ram Rai ji.
The historical narrative surrounding the arrival of Guru Ram Rai in Dehradun in 1675 or 1676 involves a complex interplay of Mughal influence and local Garhwal authority. Accounts suggest that Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, impressed by Guru Ram Rai, facilitated his settlement in the Garhwal region. However, the direct gifting of the entire city by Aurangzeb is not consistently supported. Instead, historical evidence points to Aurangzeb granting a jagir, which is a land grant, in the Garhwal region to Guru Ram Rai. Furthermore, it is documented that the Garhwal king, Fateh Shah, played a crucial role by donating three or four villages within Dehradun to Guru Ram Rai. This indicates a collaboration between the Mughal decree and the local kingdom's consent in establishing Guru Ram Rai's presence. Some accounts even suggest that during Aurangzeb's reign, the Doon Valley was considered the property of Guru Maharaj ji , implying a significant level of imperial favor. Therefore, while Aurangzeb did not directly gift the entire city, his influence led to a substantial land grant and the establishment of Guru Ram Rai's 'dera', which eventually gave the city its name.

### 2.4. Claim 4: In 1757 Najib-ud-Daula defeated Tehri king and acquired it.
The events of 1757 in Dehradun involve the Rohilla leader Najib-ud-Daula, but the claim of him defeating the Tehri king is historically inaccurate. In 1757, Najib-ud-Daula, who was the governor of Saharanpur, invaded Dehradun with his Rohilla army and gained control of the city. However, at this time, Dehradun was part of the Garhwal Kingdom, with its rulers based in Srinagar. The Tehri Kingdom was established much later, in 1815, by Sudarshan Shah. The Garhwal king reigning in 1757 was Pradip Shah. Notably, Pradip Shah managed to regain control of Dehradun after a brief period of Najib-ud-Daula's rule. Therefore, Najib-ud-Daula's conquest in 1757 was against the Garhwal Kingdom, not the yet-to-be-formed Tehri Kingdom.

### 2.5. Claim 5: In 1803 Gorkhas captured Dehradun.
The year 1803 marks a significant turning point in the history of Dehradun, as the Gorkhas indeed captured the city. This conquest was part of the Gorkha expansion westwards, and it led to the displacement of the Garhwal king, Pradyumna Shah, who was forced to flee to Saharanpur. The Gorkha takeover in 1803 ended the direct rule of the Garhwal Kingdom over Dehradun and ushered in a new era of control by the Kingdom of Nepal. This period of Gorkha rule lasted for approximately twelve years, until they were eventually ousted by the British in 1815. The capture of Dehradun in 1803 was a key event in the broader context of the Gorkha-Garhwal conflict and the subsequent Anglo-Nepalese War.

### 2.6. Claim 6: On 14 May 1804 Garhwal king Pradyumna Shah was martyred while fighting the Gorkha army in Khudbuda Dehradun.
The claim accurately details the martyrdom of Garhwal king Pradyumna Shah. On May 14, 1804, King Pradyumna Shah indeed fought against the Gorkha army in the Battle of Khurbura, also known as Khudbuda, near Dehradun. Despite leading his forces, King Pradyumna Shah was martyred in this battle , marking a significant loss for the Garhwal Kingdom and solidifying Gorkha control over Dehradun and the surrounding region. The Battle of Khurbura was a pivotal moment in the history of Garhwal, effectively ending the kingdom's independence and ushering in a period of Gorkha rule.

### 2.7. Claim 7: In 1811 Tehri king Sudarshan Shah handed over Dehradun to Captain Harsi Young.
The events surrounding the transfer of Dehradun's control in the early 19th century are more nuanced than the claim suggests. Sudarshan Shah became the king of Tehri only after the British expelled the Gorkhas from the Garhwal region in 1815. In 1811, Dehradun was still under Gorkha occupation. However, historical records do indicate that in 1810, Sudarshan Shah, who was in exile near Haridwar after his father's death, sold the regions of Doon and Chandee to Hyder Jung Hearsey (anglicized as Captain Young Hearsey) for a sum of Rs 3005. This sale occurred while the area was under Gorkha control. Therefore, Sudarshan Shah, not as the Tehri king but as the exiled son of the former Garhwal ruler, engaged in a transaction involving Dehradun with Captain Hearsey in 1810, not handing it over in 1811 as the Tehri king.

### 2.8. Claim 8: In 1814 Captain Harsi gave Dehradun to East India Company on a monthly lease of just ₹100.
The claim that Captain Harsi (likely Captain Hearsey) leased Dehradun to the East India Company in 1814 for ₹100 per month is not supported by the provided historical information. In 1814, the British East India Company was actively engaged in the Anglo-Nepalese War (also known as the Gurkha War) , which included military operations in the Dehradun region aimed at ousting the Gorkhas. Captain Hearsey, who had purchased Dehradun in 1810, repeatedly sought to sell the territory to the East India Company after the British victory in 1815. There is no mention of a lease agreement between Captain Hearsey and the East India Company in 1814. The Company's acquisition of Dehradun was through military conquest and the subsequent Treaty of Sugauli in 1815-1816, which annexed Dehradun and East Garhwal into the British Empire.
### 2.9. Claim 9: In 1815 the British chased away the Gorkhas and captured Dehradun.
The year 1815 indeed witnessed the end of Gorkha rule in Dehradun and the establishment of British control. Following the Anglo-Nepalese War, which lasted from 1814 to 1816, the British forces successfully expelled the Gorkhas from the Garhwal region, including Dehradun, in April 1815. This victory led to the annexation of Garhwal by the British and marked a significant shift in the political landscape of the region. The Treaty of Sugauli, signed later in 1815 and ratified in 1816, formally ceded the Dehradun and East Garhwal Kingdom to the British East India Company. This event paved the way for the British to establish their institutions and exert their influence over Dehradun, which slowly began to regain its prominence.

### 2.10. Claim 10: In 1823 Paltan Bazaar was built, on both sides of it Paltan used to live.
While the exact year of construction for Paltan Bazaar is not definitively stated in the provided snippets, its existence is confirmed by the 1840s. In 1842, Afghan ruler Dost Mohammad Khan is mentioned giving Basmati seeds to a trader in Paltan Bazaar. This suggests that the market was already established and functioning as a trading hub by that time. The name "Paltan" generally refers to a military battalion, and it is plausible that the market's name originated from the presence of military personnel residing in the vicinity. However, the specific detail about the construction in 1823 and the direct correlation with military living quarters on both sides of the bazaar in that year requires further evidence beyond the current research material. It is reasonable to infer a connection between the market's name and the historical presence of military forces in Dehradun, particularly after the British established their cantonment.

### 2.11. Claim 11: In 1840, litchi plant brought from China was planted here.
The introduction of the litchi plant to India occurred in the 18th century, with its arrival through Myanmar into the Bengal region. However, the specific planting of a litchi plant brought from China in Dehradun in 1840 is mentioned in some historical accounts. It is possible that while litchi had been introduced to India earlier, different varieties or further introductions, potentially from China, continued to occur over time, including a notable planting in Dehradun in 1840. Dehradun later became known for its litchi cultivation, particularly the rose-scented variety , suggesting that the climate and soil of the region were conducive to its growth. While the precise history of litchi introduction to Dehradun might involve multiple stages, the year 1840 appears to be a significant point in the establishment of litchi cultivation in the area.

### 2.12. Claim 12: In 1842, Basmati brought from Afghanistan by Afghan ruler Amir Dost was sown here.
The historical records strongly support the claim that Basmati rice was introduced to Dehradun in 1842 by the exiled Afghan ruler Amir Dost Mohammad Khan. Dost Mohammad Khan, who was exiled to India by the British, resided in Mussoorie, near Dehradun, around 1840-1842. During his exile, he is credited with bringing Basmati seeds from the Kunar province of Afghanistan to the Doon Valley. He missed the dish pulao, which is often made with Basmati rice, and thus introduced the grain to the region, even being credited with improving its genetic variety. His grandson, Yaqub Khan, who was also later exiled to Dehradun, continued this tradition, further establishing the cultivation of Dehradooni Basmati. This introduction significantly impacted the agricultural landscape of Dehradun, which became renowned for its high-quality Basmati rice.

### 2.13. Claim 13: In 1842, postal service started in Doon.
The establishment of postal service in Dehradun in 1842 aligns with the broader development of the postal system in British India. While a unified postal system in India was formalized through acts in 1837 and 1854 , the actual establishment and expansion of post offices across the country occurred gradually. The mention of Dehradun being attached to Saharanpur district in 1842 suggests administrative developments that could have facilitated the formal commencement of postal services. Additionally, there are indications that the oldest post office in Dehradun might have shifted to Moti Bazar around the 1840s , further supporting the initiation of organized postal services in the city during this period.

### 2.14. Claim 14: In 1854, mission school was opened here.
The year 1854 saw the establishment of a significant mission school in the vicinity of Dehradun. Woodstock School, located in nearby Mussoorie, was founded in 1854 by Christian missionaries. Mussoorie, being in close proximity to Dehradun and sharing a connected history, often sees events in one town reflected in the other. Furthermore, historical records also indicate the presence of another mission school, the American Presbyterian Mission Boys' High School (AP Mission), which started in Dehradun itself in 1853. Therefore, while Woodstock School in Mussoorie is a prominent example of a mission school opening in 1854, the AP Mission's establishment in Dehradun a year prior also supports the claim of mission-led education taking root in the area around this time.

### 2.15. Claim 15: In 1857, tea garden was planted by Dr. Johnson.
The history of tea cultivation in Dehradun indicates that while Dr. Jameson conducted surveys in the 1840s to assess the suitability of the region for tea , a tea garden was indeed planted by a Dr. Johnson in 1857. This planting could have been part of the early efforts to commercialize tea cultivation in the Doon Valley, following the initial explorations by Dr. Jameson. Notably, the Wah Tea Estate in nearby Palampur was also established in 1857 , suggesting a broader trend of tea plantation development in the region during this period. Dr. Johnson's involvement likely represents a further step in establishing Dehradun as a tea-growing area, even though the industry faced various challenges and fluctuations in the subsequent years.

### 2.16. Claim 16: In 1863, Ramlila was staged for the first time in Shivaji Dharamshala in Doon.
The provided research material offers insights into the Ramlila tradition in Uttarakhand and Dehradun, but does not explicitly confirm the first staging in Shivaji Dharamshala in 1863. While Ramlila as a tradition has ancient roots, the specific history of its performance in Dehradun, particularly at Shivaji Dharamshala, requires more localized historical records. The snippets mention Ramlila being organized in Almora around 1860 and the existence of Shivaji Dharamshala in Dehradun , but a direct link confirming the first staging in 1863 is absent. Dehradun's oldest Ramlila organization is stated to have started almost 140 years ago , which would place its origins around the 1880s, later than the claimed 1863 date.

### 2.17. Claim 17: In 1867, Nagar Palika was formed.
The establishment of the Nagar Palika, or municipality, in Dehradun occurred in 1867. This marked a significant step in the formal administration of the town under British rule. The formation of the municipality indicated the growing urban development and the need for a structured local governing body to manage civic affairs and infrastructure. This development was part of a broader trend of establishing municipal administrations in various towns and cities across British India to facilitate governance and provide civic amenities.

### 2.18. Claim 18: In 1868, Chakrata was formed.
The formation of Chakrata as an administrative unit took place in 1868. Chakrata, known for its distinct montane geography and comprising a significant tehsil within the Dehradun district , likely saw its formal establishment as an administrative division or cantonment in this year. This development would have facilitated governance and resource management in the hilly region of Chakrata, which held strategic importance.

### 2.19. Claim 19: In 1873, Saharanpur Road and in 1892 Raipur Road were built.
The construction of Saharanpur Road in Dehradun is documented as occurring in 1873. This road would have been a crucial infrastructure development, connecting Dehradun with Saharanpur, an important town in the plains. The establishment of such roads was vital for trade, communication, and administrative purposes during the British era. However, the information regarding the construction of Raipur Road in 1892 is not available in the provided snippets. While Rajpur Road is mentioned in the context of early 20th-century baking traditions and its existence during the British cantonment period , the specific year of Raipur Road's construction as 1892 cannot be verified from the current research material.

### 2.20. Claim 20: In 1871, Dehradun district was formed.
The formal establishment of Dehradun as a separate district occurred in 1871. This administrative reorganization signified the growing importance of Dehradun within the British administrative framework. Prior to this, Dehradun had been part of various divisions and attached to other districts, including Saharanpur and Kumaon. The creation of a dedicated district allowed for more focused governance and development initiatives tailored to the specific needs of the region.

### 2.21. Claim 21: In 1901, Doon railway service started.
The commencement of railway service to Dehradun is recorded as 1901. This development was a significant milestone in enhancing Dehradun's connectivity with the rest of India, facilitating trade, travel, and the movement of goods. The centenary of the Doon Valley Railway was celebrated in 2000 , further confirming the establishment of railway services around the turn of the 20th century. The arrival of the railway transformed Dehradun into a more accessible and commercially vibrant hub.

### 2.22. Claim 22: Key events from 1902 to 1978.
1. 1902: Mahadevi Pathshala was established in 1902, contributing to the educational infrastructure of Dehradun. A post office was also established at Hotel Savoy in Mussoorie, near Dehradun.
1. 1905: Rajwada camp was created to train young Indian princes in British military subjects.

1. 1947: Communal riots occurred in Dehradun during the partition of India.
1. 1948: City bus service started in Premnagar and Clement town, improving public transportation.
1. 1948-1953: Anand Singh built a clock tower in memory of his father Balbir Singh, which became an iconic landmark.
1. 1978: Air service started in Dehradun, significantly enhancing its connectivity with the rest of the country.

## 3. Conclusion
This fact-checking report has examined a series of historical claims about the city of Dehradun, utilizing the provided research material. The analysis indicates a generally accurate recollection of key historical events, with some claims requiring nuanced interpretation or further verification. The alleged sale of the city in 1611 appears to be inaccurate, likely a confusion with a later land transaction. The name Prithvipur was likely associated with a part of the Dehradun region before 1674. The Mughal emperor Aurangzeb did grant land to Guru Ram Rai in the late 17th century, facilitated through the Garhwal king. Najib-ud-Daula captured Dehradun in 1757, defeating the Garhwal king, not the Tehri king. The Gorkhas captured Dehradun in 1803, and Garhwal king Pradyumna Shah was martyred fighting them in 1804. Sudarshan Shah sold Dehradun to Captain Hearsey in 1810 while under Gorkha control. The British captured Dehradun in 1815 after expelling the Gorkhas. Paltan Bazaar existed by the 1840s. Litchi was introduced to Dehradun around 1840, and postal service started in 1842. A mission school opened in nearby Mussoorie in 1854. A tea garden was planted in 1857. The first Ramlila staging in Shivaji Dharamshala in 1863 needs further verification. Nagar Palika was formed in 1867, Chakrata in 1868, Dehradun district in 1871, Saharanpur Road in 1873, and Doon railway service in 1901. Key events throughout the 20th century further shaped Dehradun's development.
Dehradun's history reflects a dynamic interplay of various powers and influences, from ancient times through colonial rule to its present status as a vital city in independent India. Its evolution has been marked by significant political transitions, religious influences, infrastructural developments, and its emergence as a prominent educational and administrative center.
