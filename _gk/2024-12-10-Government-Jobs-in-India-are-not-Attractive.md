# why Government Jobs in India are not Attractive?

In the winter session of 2024 of the Indian Parliament, the government responded about the VRS (Voluntary Retirement Scheme) of 850 IRS (Indian Revenue Service) officers, since 2014. I thought let me share my analysis on it. Not only the revenue service but any government job is not that attractive in India as it was before 1991 or before 2014. Here are my observations.

Do you remember how much time we were wasting earlier in photocopy attestation by gazetted officers, standing in queues for electricity/phone/water bill payment, traffic fines, court and session courts circling, minister's recommendations, VIP movements, VIP treatment, etc.? It has all reduced to a great extent, and we are moving towards a developed nation from a developing nation, where the government and bureaucracy is more powerful than the public.

## **Key Factors**
1. **Reduced Opportunities for Corruption 💰🚫**  
   - Introduction of faceless systems limits chances for side income through bribery.  
   - Many officers resign after accumulating enough wealth for financial security.

2. **Impact of Technology 💻⚙️**  
   - **Faceless Systems**: Eliminates public interaction, reducing traditional perks of power.  
   - **Automation**: Makes roles more desk-oriented and less dynamic.  
   - **Online Services**: Diminishes need for in-person interactions, curbing manipulative opportunities.  

3. **Increased Accountability 📜🎯**  
   - Higher targets and stricter measures under new government policies lead to dissatisfaction.  
   - Forced retirements for corruption charges contribute to resignations.  

4. **Better Private Sector Opportunities 💼🏦**  
   - Lucrative salaries, better work-life balance, and global exposure attract officers.  
   - Post-COVID trends encourage career shifts toward entrepreneurship and private roles.  

5. **Job Challenges 😓📊**  
   - Increasing pressure and declining perks reduce the appeal of IRS jobs.  
   - The traditional societal prestige associated with government jobs is diminishing.

6. **Evolving Career Aspirations 🌟**  
   - Youth prefer dynamic, growth-oriented careers over stable but rigid government roles.  
   - The rise of entrepreneurial culture shifts focus away from public sector opportunities.

7. **Corporate Sector Appeal 💼**  
    - Higher salaries, performance-based incentives, and flexible work environments make private jobs more attractive.  
    - Corporate roles often offer international opportunities and modern work cultures.

8. **Rigid Bureaucracy 📜**  
    - Government jobs often lack flexibility, stifling creativity and innovation.  
    - Strict hierarchical systems can be discouraging for younger generations.  

9. **Frequent Transfers 🚛**  
    - Frequent relocations disrupt family stability and children’s education.  
    - Dual-career families struggle to align government job transfers with personal goals.  

10. **Competitive and Lengthy Recruitment Process 🏁**  
    - Exams like UPSC require years of preparation with no guarantee of success.  
    - Prolonged hiring processes and reservation quotas add to the frustration.  

11. **Changing Work Culture 🌐**  
    - Millennials and Gen Z prioritize work-life balance and hybrid/remote work options.  
    - Government jobs often fail to offer flexibility or modern workplace environments.  

12. **Economic Challenges 💵**  
    - Rising urban living costs make government salaries less appealing.  
    - Reduced side-income opportunities (e.g., through corruption) discourage aspirants.

13. **Reform in Benefits 🏦**  
    - The New Pension Scheme (NPS) offers fewer post-retirement benefits compared to older systems.  
    - Earlier guarantees of financial security and stability have diminished.

    - Corruption persists in other departments, showing systemic issues remain unresolved.

16. **Cultural and Systemic Shifts 🌍🔄**
