# Basics of Jyotish    

## Astrology is Pure Data Science
Let's say we want to study how safe you drive on road, we want to predict whether you will have any accident in next 30 days or not. Now, ask yourself on what factors it depends? I will list some variables below. You think about each of these variables and you will realise all these factor has relations with your safe driving and accidents. Relationship may be weak or strong, it may be positive or negative that is different matter but some relationship is there. Stronger the relation, more important that variable in predicting the outcome.
- Your profession
- Your food habits
- At the time of driving, for long you are hungry
- How long you been driving continuosly
- Your age
- How many children you have
- Profession of your spouse
- Your household income
- Age of your children
- Are you heart patient?
- Are you having ABC disease? (this can be long list)
- Do you do meditation
- Do you meditate regularly
Now you see, we can add 1000 more variables and some variables less and some more influence our driving habit and useful in predicting the accident.

Using this data if we create a model and start predicting accient or ticket/challan, obviously some of the prediction will be false negative, some will be false positive. But if model is have good variables in it then it predicts much better than the random guess.

In older time, when people were interest in predicting the life they were using time related variable, which are more reliable and what is more reliable in the cosmos than the movement of planets and stars in the sky? Now people started tracking the movement of these stars in the sky and events on the earth. Fire, earth quake, pendemic, war, rain, crop, fight, loss, gain of individuals, family and of king. And they developed a subject around this, that subject is astrology.

We must understand relationship doesn't mean causation. For example, if there is heat then an icecream seller is very happy. There is relationship between heat and icecream seller's happiness, more the temperature more happy he is but this relationship doesn't mean icecream seller is happy because hot whether. He is happy because of some other reason. His icecream sale is high! Cause of his happiness is his sale not temprature.

Similarly when astrologers see some patterns of planets and stars in the sky and they know there patterns are repetitive, cycle of occurance can vary from hour to day to month to year or century but here is cyclicity. Now they observe on the planet also there is cyclicity of the events, we call popularly call, history repeats itself in different ways. This relationship between events on the earth and events in the sky has relationship. Whether there is causation or not, that is different subject for the study. But if the model is good you cannot deny the relationship.

## Sky observation
- At any point of the day or night, if we are on the plane ground without obstacle of mountain or building we can 180 degree space. It means whatever planets or stars in the sky we can see, we see half of that what exists not more than that 
- Even to see that you need to have cloud free sky, and no sun above in your seen sky, otherwise sun light or cloud will hinder the view.
- With our naked eyes we can very limited sky, we need telescope to see the deep space, more powerful and more clean sky better view you will have. That is why telescope which is placed outside of the earth environment can see take better picture of the deep space.

## Sun based astrology
- Entire space is virtually divided in 12 parts. 
- Entire space around the earth is 360 degree. Therefore each part is 30 degree.
- Earth completes rotation around the sun (i.e. 360), we call that a year. Because the space around is divided into 12 part, we have 12 months. 
- In each month earth moves 30 degree around the sun.
- Corresponding to each virtual part there is one Zodiac sign or Rashi.
- Zodiac sign is related to sun's (appeared) movement  in the sky in different Rishi or Zodiac Signs.
- Earth moves around it orbit this is called earth's axis rotation, it causes day and night.
- Earth moves around the sun it causes change in month. This leads to sun is seen in different rashi in different month 
- Earth moves around the sun in tilted way, it is cause of seasons.
- 12 Zodiac sing in the order are as following: 
	1. Aries (मेष - Mesh)
	2. Taurus (वृष - Vrish)
	3. Gemini (मिथुन - Mithun)
	4 Cancer (कर्क - Kark)
	5. Leo (सिंह - Simha)
	6. Virgo (कन्या - Kanya)
	7. Libra (तुला - Tula)
	8. Scorpio (वृश्चिक - Vrishchik)
	9. Sagittarius (धनु - Dhanu)
	10. Capricorn (मकर - Makar)
	11. Aquarius (कुंभ - Kumbh)
	12. Pisces (मीन - Meen)
- So earth is on each Zodiac sign for one month. We observe this as entry of sun in that zodiac sign, at the peak and exit of the sun from that Zodiac sign. 
- When we see the effect of zodiac sign on earthly life we consider these three parts.

## Moon based astrology
- Keeping the moon's movement in mind space around earth can be divided into 27 parts.
- Entire space around the earth is 360, therefore each part is 13 degree 20 minutes 
- Each part is called one Nakshatra, it is similar to zodic sign of sun based astrology.
- Each nakshatra has a unique name. Name goes in this order as following: Ashwini, Bharani, Krittika, Rohini, Mrigashira, Ardra, Punarvasu, Pushya, Ashlesha, Magha, Purva Phalguni, Uttara Phalguni, Hasta, Chitra, Swati, Vishakha, Anuradha, Jyeshtha, Mula, Purva Ashadha, Uttara Ashadha, Shravana, Dhanishta, Shatabhisha, Purva Bhadrapada, Uttara Bhadrapada, Revati
- Moon remains in each nakshtra roughly one day. So in a month's time from one new moon to another new moon, the moon goes through all the nakshtra.
- On average it taks 29.5 days for sun to complete the rotation around the sun.
- Moon's movement around the earth cause Tithi. All tithi are not same duration. All tithi doesn't start or end same time.
- A moon month can be 27 days to 32 days longer.
- As per lunar calendar some year can have 13 months, in Bharat we call that Malmaas, it is added in Sravan month, It happens every fourth year.
- 12 Months of the Hindu calendar are 
	- Chaitra: March - April
	- Vaishakha: April - May
	- Jyeshtha: May - June
	- Ashadha: June - July
	- Shravana: July - August
	- Bhadrapada: August - September
	- Ashwin: September - October
	- Kartika: October - November
	- Margashirsha: November - December
	- Pausha: December - January
	- Magha: January - February
	- Phalguna: February - March
- Above 12 months and 27 nakshatra has some similarity in name but there is no relationship.
- Moon's rotation around the earth is such, the time moon take to rotate around the earth is exactly same time it take to rotate around its own axis. So we can never see other part of the moon from the earth. That part is called far side, but don't think it is dark, sun rays falls on that part of the moon similar to the part which we can see. Because of this reason, day on the moon is equal to 15 days of earth and night is equal to another 15 days of the earth. It means in a month time of earth, from the moons surface you can see only one day and one night.
- In world Hindu (Panchang), Muslim (Hijri), Jews and Chinese follow the moon calendar.
- When Hindus make their birth horoscope they consider Sun and Moon both therefore Zodic sign and Nakshatra is important. It is different thing that nowadays we only remember Zodiac sign and they not aware about Nakshatra.

	- If you see 5 is written in the place of 1 (House 1), it means Leo (Zodiac 5th sign) is at the time of birth. then every number will shift by 5. In anticlockwise manner you have write other number 6,7, etc in 2,4, etc houses. In that case it would look like below.
