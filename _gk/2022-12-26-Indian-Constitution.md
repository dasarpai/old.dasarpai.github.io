# The Indian Constitution       
    
An individual has different roles in personal, social, and professional life and s/he exists at the different levels. When one is interacting with others in the family or society or profession s/he is governed by ethics, culture, tradition, etc. All these help in forming rules. Some of these rules may be coming from your religious books and some others are unwritten rules of the family or society. When a state needs to manage its citizen or citizen need to interact with the state there are certain rules that guide interdependence and trust. In earlier times these rules were coming from our religious books or holy man. But over a period of time when states become a republic state where people of different faiths are living then one religious book cannot govern the rule of society and all the citizens. One book which governs all the citizens of a state and the state itself is called Constitution.    
    
If you are living in a republic state and you don't know your religious book you can manage your life but if you are a sensible person and you don't know the constitution of the land then you will always live the fear. Generally, it looks the law or rule of the land should be common sense based, culture based. But there may be a gap between your understanding and the way constitution defines things. Any violation can cause you problems.    
    
For a very long period of time, the Indian constitution was very confusing for me. I am not a lawyer not I am interested in becoming a lawyer. My personal philosophy is, in your entire life if you do not deal with the judicial system, police system, and medical system then you are a blessed person or most lucky person. But, at the same time if you understand your constitution or law of the land you will be able to live as an aware citizen and you can deal with things in a mature way.    
    
After long deliberation, today I thought let me document the summary and structure of the Indian constitution and help my audience in getting clarification around some confusing terms.    
    
## Structure of the Indian Constitution    
Indian constitution is approx 400 pages book. The main content of the book is spread is initial 280+ pages. The second part of this book has “Schedules”, it is spread over 100+ pages and the remaining 20+ pages are appendices.    
    
The first part of this book has 22 parts which contain 395 articles. These articles are spread across 22 parts. The second part of this book is 12 schedules. The final part has 3 appendices. The overall design of this book is as follows.    
    
- Main Contents     
	- Parts (Each part has a unique name, you can treat them as sections of a big book, there are 22 parts)    
		- Chapter (Each chapter has a unique name, it is like a typical chapter of a book. Each section/part has multiple chapters. But some parts have only one section so the chapter/section name is not given)    
			- Article (Each Article has a unique name, you can consider them as the main headings of each chapter of any book. There are 395 articles in the original constitution, over the period of time there have been additions of new articles, modifications, and deletions of some articles. The change in these articles happened through a process called "Amendment". Since 26-Nov-1949 our constitution has had 100+ amendments. Due to this reason number of articles today is 448). Article numbers are continuous and do not restart at the start of a new part or chapter.    
				- Section (Each section has a unique name, you can consider them as heading 2 of any chapter.)    
- Schedule:     
	- Second half of the Indian Constitution has 12 "SCHEDULES".     
		- Parts (Each schedule has different parts and there is a unique name for each part). Each schedule is related to 1+ articles discussed in the "first part of the book"     
    
Apart from the main constitution, there are 739 acts. Which are not part of the constitution but they were created because the Indian constitution tells this to Government. Different articles of the constitution dictate the government to do so. Many of these acts were created before 1950 (before our constitution was adopted by us). With almost nil or small amendments, those acts are the same as before.     
    
## Naming Convention    
- Bill = Vidheyak : Brought into the parliament/assembly by some MLA or MP. It was discussed in the parliament.    
- Act = Adhiniyam : When a bill is discussed in the parliament/assembly and then the bill is passed by the parliament/assembly and approved/signed by the president or governor then it becomes an act. Every bill may not be approved by Governor or President, if so it cannot become an act. Sometimes an act can be created by bringing Ordinance/Adhyadesh. But it is valid only for 6 months.    
- Law = Kanoon = Code : Once an act is passed, the rules, regulations, and bylaws can be defined and Law can be created with the help of experts.    
- Articles = Anucheda: Components of the main constitution are called Articles.    
- Section = Dhaara: Components of the acts are called Dhaara or Section.    
- Criminal Law = Fauzdaari Kannon     
- Civil Law = Diwani Kannon    
- Role of Government/Department: Follow the rules and make sure that citizens follow the rule.     
- Role of Enforcement Agencies: If people are not following the rule then remind them, and fine them.    
- Role of Judiciary: If citizens or government agencies or enforcement agencies have some grievance then Judiciary needs to listen and guide the parties to follow the rule.    
- Civil law does not grant a jail sentence but imposes a fine. If you don't pay a fine then jail can be imposed.    
- Criminal law grant jail sentence and can also impose fine.    
- What is a crime or violation of the law, it is defined in the IPC and in every individual act.     
- What is the sentence, it is defined in CrPC and in every individual act.    
- Session court / सत्र न्यायालय  :  Deals with criminal cases.    
- District Cour / जिला न्यायालय :  Deal with civil cases.    
    
## Type of Courts    
- Supreme Court (Headed by Chief Justice of India. Supreme court has a provision for other 30 Judges)    
	- High Court (Chief Justice of High Court. There are 25 high courts in India. They have a provision of 1108 judges)    
		- Session Court (District Magistrate) + District Courts (District Magistrate)    
			- Taluk Courts    
		    
## Important Notes    
- Constitution describes the restrictions of a state whereas IPC describes on restrictions of people	    
- Part or chapter or article of the constitution may be omitted by bringing amendments to the constitution.    
- New parts, chapters, and articles can be added to the constitution by bringing amendments to the constitution.    
- There is a complicated process for a constitutional amendment.    
- As of October 2021, there have been 105 amendments to the Constitution of India.
- IPC (Indian Panel Code) is one of the 739 acts. IPC has 511 sections and Dhaara.    
    
## Important IPC sections    
- Section 307 = Attempt to Murder    
- Section 302 = Murder    
- Section 376 = Rape     
- Section 395 = Dacoity    
- Section 377 = Unnatural Act    
- Section 396 = Murder during Dacoity (डकैती के दौरान हत्या)    
- Section 120 = Consipiracy (षडयंत्र रचना )    
- Section 365 = Kidnap (अपहरण )
