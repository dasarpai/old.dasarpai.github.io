<h1>Ek Kendra for Data Science </h1>
This is the place to learn everything about Data Science, Data Engineering, Data Analytics, EDA, AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, LLM, RAG, GAN, NLP, RL and much more. This blog draws from my three decades of experience in Data Science, Project Management, AI/ML, IT Technology, Software Development, Process Automation, and Business Analytics across diverse domains such as Logistics, BFSI, Health, Education, Staffing, and NGOs. I have held various roles, including Programmer, Architect, Business Analyst, Data Analyst, Product Manager, Project Manager, Program Manager, Delivery Head, Trainer, Coach, Consultant, and Mentor, in different companies. These experiences have given me a deep understanding of businesses and how technology can help them make better and timely decisions to maximize stakeholder engagement and drive more business.   

In my experience, making business decisions while ignoring key factors is like trying to see the world with one eye.

<ul>
	<li>Technical capabilities of the organization</li>
	<li>Market competition</li>
	<li>Future growth</li>
	<li>Current business need</li>
	<li>Project budget</li>
	<li>Time to respond</li>
	<li>Well-defined business requirements</li>
</ul>

About data science I think, sometimes data is dying in the harddisk in dark storeroom, othertimes data it is screaming before us. But we don't want to listen other than what we like. Dying without water is one problem but dying/struggling at the bank of river is problem of many organizations. Time has come when organization need to bring their data value to their balancesheets and use this assets otherwise its is liablity to maintain those storage devices.

AI is great and it is changing everything in and around our businesses, but we need to ask the project in hand is AI project or simple process automation. Due diligence to apply AI technologies is a must. Don't ask questions like how AI can help our business, or what AI tool can be used. It is like putting cart before the horse. Business does not run for technology but technology should help us doing business in efficient way. Therefore ask the question, can we do better using existing resources, technologies and processes? What is the meaning of better for us? The definition of better may be

 <ul>
	<li>Reducing cost</li>
	<li>Reducing time</li>
	<li>Improving quality</li>
	<li>Improving customer experience</li>
	<li>Reducing turnaround time</li>
	<li>Reducing waste</li>
	<li>Removing last moment surprises</li>
	<li>Improving compliance</li>
	<li>Improving brand value</li>
	<li>Increasing sales</li>
	<li>Or any other metrics which is important to your team, department, organization or business vertical.</li>
</ul>
	
About Data Science Project I think, AI is also software, but AI projects are not like typical software project. They have completely different pipelines and project lifecycle, and hence need different methodologies and tools to manage AI projects.

<h2> This is the way I live in this world.</h2>

 <ul>
	<li> Philosophy connects me to Self,   </li>
	<li> Management connects me to the stakeholders around,   </li>
	<li> Technology helps creating solution for myself and people around.   </li>
	<li> Before becoming the change agent, first uncluttered your own mind and space around. </li>    
 </ul>
