## Ek Kendra for Data Science
One place to learn everything about Data Science, AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, GAN, NLP, RL. This blog contains my 3 decades experience around Project Management, IT Technology, Software Development, Process Automation, Business Analytics in diverse domains like Logistic, BFSI, Health, Education, Staffing, and NGO. In various roles like Programmer, Architect, Business Analyst, Data Analyst, Product Manager, Project Manager, Program Manager, Delivery Head, Trainer, Coach, Consultant, Mentors with different companies. I gain a deeper understanding about the businesses and how technology can help businesses in making better and timely decisions which can maximize the stakeholder engagement and more business. 

In my experience, making the business decision ignoring any of these factors like technical capabilities of the organization, market competition, future growth, current business need, project budget, time to respond, well-defined business requirements. It is trying to see the world with one eye.

AI is great and changing everything in and around our businesses, but we need to ask the project in hand is AI project or simple process automation. Due diligence to apply AI technologies is a must.

AI is software, but AI projects are not like typical software project. They have completely different pipelines and project lifecycle, and hence need different methodologies and tools to manage AI projects.

## This is the way I live in this world.
	Philosophy connects me to Self,   
	Management connects me to the stakeholders around,   
	Technology helps creating solution for myself and people around.  
   First organize or uncluttered in your own mind then only try to bring order in team, business, and processes around you.
