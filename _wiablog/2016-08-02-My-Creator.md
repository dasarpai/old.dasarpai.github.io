## My Creator

    
There was the time     
When I had no eyes but could navigate the world better     
When I had no ear but could listen to the conversations better     
When I had no heart but feel the emotions better    
    
There was the time     
When there was no light because I didn’t have eyes     
When there was no sound because I didn’t have ear     
Who said that the creator created light and sound before eyes and ear?    
    
But there was the time     
Because I had the mind     
In the mind, I had all my accumulated karma packed in the seed form     
And I was navigating the world    
    
There was no god     
because I had no devotion     
I was navigating the cosmos to manifest myself     
To create myself again at my will    
    
But can I create myself at my will?     
Especially when I had a time and a mind with packed Samchit Sanskara.     
Neither time was in my control nor my seed     
This seed is my mind which I create myself    
    
Then one young girl and boy came together     
They created a body     
Out of their will or at the will of their parent’s     
Out of fun or out of social competition     
I am not aware, I don’t know, I will never know the truth    
    
I was interested in my truth and manifestation     
So, I chose that body     
After some time I was delivered to the world     
In a fresh new body     
This I “did” to manifest myself     
That was my first karma of this life.    
    
Now I had eyes which I could open and blink     
Now I had ears which I could use to listen     
But only to those who are near to my physical body    
    
Those who created a body for me     
I called them my parents     
But more then I could know that they are my parents     
They knew I am their son!    
    
Slowly, my parents and people around them educated me     
And I started feeling that they are my own     
Only they are mine!     
I belong only to them!     
Whatever is there is mine!     
Whatever is mine is of only theirs!    
    
This way I started creating myself     
One who was formless has a form now     
One who had all karma in the seed form     
Started exhausting karma, seed started become a tree     
And simultaneously started new karma,     
Without knowing that these karma are creating     
the seed for my next manifestation     
So tree created other seeds    
    
So who is my creator?     
The physical body is created by my biological parents     
The mental body I already had     
with this, I chose my physical body     
And consequently my parents.     
After coming to this planet     
I created myself every day     
By eating the food which comes to my plate     
By assimilating the ideas     
which are thrown upon me from all around the world    
    
So with the help of relations     
Which I called parents, guru, friends, brothers &amp; sisters     
I created myself     
Was there any choice in this creation?    
    
That question comes only when     
you do not like the circumstances you are in.     
You don’t ask this question when all is joyful around you.    
    
There are very few who keep asking this question     
Even in the moment of joy that     
Is there is any choice for me?     
Is there any free will?     
Who is in me, who is happy?     
Who is in me, who is sad?     
Who is in me, who wants to grow &amp; become big?     
Who is in me, who wants to flow in the space without wings?     
Who is in me, who doesn’t want to die?     
Who created me?    
    
The beauty of these questions is     
Everybody will get his own answer     
So never ask these questions outside     
Keep searching, without getting settled to anyone answer     
Life is not an exam that you pass or fail,     
If you are not able to answer these question     
Or you will get A+ grade for the best answer    
    
So, I bless &amp; pray for all     
that you keep asking these questions     
And you never get the answer     
which will settle in your whole life.    
    
You cannot ask these questions to others to settle yourself     
If you get an answer from another that is bookish for you     
Your answer is that which you get from your own travel     
Travel ends only at a cremation ground    
    
What will you do even if you get the answer to these questions?     
What will you do even if you get settled with answers?     
So my prayer is you never settled for these questions     
Who is my creator?     
What did you say God in heaven?     
Then you are tricked by someone!    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Your Truly Hari
