# Cause Of Pain And Suffering   
       
I am a body.     
Therefore I must have pain and comfort.     
And I can cause pain and comfort for others.    
    
I am a mind.     
Therefore I feel love and hate for others.     
Hence I feel enjoyment and suffering.     
And as a mind, I can cause enjoyment and suffering for others.    
    
I am an intellect.     
Therefore I can win and lose in arguments.     
I can help other in learning and confuse others.     
And an a intellect, clarity and confusion are to me.    
    
If I know myself truly without body, mind and intellect     
then what pain, comfort, suffering, enjoyment, win, and lose     
I can have and cause to others?    
    
But people saying I am Atman is foolish and bookish.     
If people know they are Atman then     
where is the place for these bodily and mental experiences?    
    
This is what Arjunaâ€™s Friend saying Mithyachari.     
Aachaar (behavior) of Mithya (that which seems but not there).     
In plain English Hypocrisy.    
    
Tat Tvam Asi     
Yours Truly Hari
