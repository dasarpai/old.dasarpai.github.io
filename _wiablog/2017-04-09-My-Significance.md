## My Significance

    
One day, I came out of my apartment     
Went one a long travel to the mountains     
Here I am standing at the feet of a mountain     
There is a peak where I wish to go.    
    
With my efforts, I could reach     
on the mountain top after six hours     
But after reaching there I found     
Many larger mountains than on which I was standing.    
    
All these tall looking mountains standing on earth     
But, If one could put all these mountains in an ocean     
Then they all will disappear, this is their smallness.     
And, all the ocean resting on the earth    
    
This earth is rotating around the sun     
Sun rotating around the galaxies.     
Stars, Planets, Galaxies are eaten by black-hole     
And many black-holes exist in space.    
    
If this whole space is like a     
one million years old banyan tree     
who had many leaves, branches, and fruits in the past     
today it has the same number of leaves, branches &amp; fruits.     
But, are these same leaves, branches &amp; fruits for million years?    
    
On this huge banyan tree     
there are millions of fruits hanging today     
My significance is not more than     
a seed inside the fruit of this tree.     
In the size that is how big I am.    
    
Is there any specific seed, fruit, leaf, or branch     
more important in this million years old tree?    
    
If a particular seed wants to pray to this tree does it help the tree?     
Can a particular seed revolt against the tree?     
If a seed revolt then how does it impact the tree?    
    
If a specific seed decides to     
live long face life while living on the tree?     
Does the tree get impacted?    
    
What if a specific seed decide to live     
a joyful life on the tree?     
Does the tree become happy?    
    
What if a specific seed thinks     
I am very special on this tree?     
I should get special treatment     
And special treatment from all other     
seeds, fruits, leaves, and branches of this tree.     
Whom does this seed making fool?    
    
In a life of millions of years the tree     
has seen many seeds like me     
who are happy or unhappy.    
    
They come and go but the tree remains     
What a fuss is this that I am a special seed     
need special treatment on this tree     
otherwise, I will destroy others     
around me and this tree as well.    
    
The tree has seen, many fools like me     
who come out from it     
remain there for a couple of years     
rest on a some remote far branch     
and finally, go the ground     
and become manure for the tree    
    
Perhaps for the tree, they are more useful     
when they become manure for the tree.    
    
O Pratibimba, how can an insignificant seed     
become significant while living inside the fruit on the tree?    
    
O Hari, seed need to go in the ground     
finish himself and become another tree     
That is the only way.     
But then seed does not know     
I am a seed or branch or fruit     
It knows I am a million old tree.    
    
So an insignificant becomes most significant     
when it is finished and loses its identity with smallness or bigness     
A seed becomes significant when     
it knows there is no second to compete.     
I am the one and basis of all.    
    
O Pratibimba, perhaps I got it.     
I am a small seed on this tree     
If I keep aside this physical body     
and live like an eternal being     
Then am I that million old tree?
