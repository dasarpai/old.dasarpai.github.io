# What is the Miracle?      
   
When some hot water falls on the body     
and it burns the body,     
burning didn’t happen because of a miracle.    
    
If something hanging at height is cut from the source     
and it falls to the ground.     
The falling didn’t happen because of a miracle.    
    
In the rainy season, if you put a seed in the ground     
and after some time a tree comes out of the seed,     
the new life has not come because of a miracle.    
    
If the earth is revolving around the sun     
then this revolution is not because of a miracle.    
    
If you pickup your cell phone and     
able to talk with somebody in different part of the world     
then talking is not because of a miracle.    
    
If it is still miracle for your in the 21st century     
it means you don’t understand the science behind it.     
Science helps us in understanding the working of nature.     
Nature works the way it exits.    
    
If some good person meets you in life and     
he becomes your partner or good friend,     
then it is a miracle.     
    
Because out of billions of people on this planet     
if you happen to meet someone at any time     
and you become close to him is a matter of probabilities.     
You can calculate the probabilities     
but you cannot tell whether it will happen or not.     
Why it happens to you only, it is unexplainable, so it is a miracle.    
    
A person go to some place and get caught in     
an encounter between security forces and terrorists,     
finally that innocent person is killed. It is a miracle.     
You can give all shallow reasons why that person was killed     
but you cannot truly explain why this incident happened to that particular person.     
It is a game of probability. It is unexplainable, so it is a miracle.    
    
Some so-called good person dies in some accident or     
because of some critical illness.     
It is a game of probabilities,     
you cannot truly explain why that incident happened to that particular person.     
It is unexplainable, so it is a miracle.    
    
Whatever cannot be explained why human,     
he assigns that to his past Karma.     
Some assign this to God.     
Some others assign it to the mysterious way of working of nature.    
Many people think assigning an act of miracle to God will serve the purpose.     
    
In future they will get favor     
or they get strength to go through the trauma of the bad happening     
or they get more chances of good events in their life.     
    
For many this serves their purpose and for others it doesn’t serve.     
The fact is even after so much science     
and so many years on the planet     
We don't know fully how this cosmos works.     
Spiritual people say this cosmos is infinitely intelligent.    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Yours Truly Hari
