# Managing Source Of Energy   
    
If we group people based on     
their energy characteristics     
then groups will look like this.Volcano, Pressure cooker on burning heat stove,     
explosive bomb, LED bulb, Small led light,     
Halogen bulb in the street, Hot black color plate     
which cannot be seen as hot,     
hot coffee, a cube of ice, and a mountain of snow.Every energy body around us has     
their relevance and purpose,     
Living in happiness with that energy source     
depends upon who is handling and     
how that energy source is handled.In business, social, or family life     
we suffer because we don’t know     
how to handle an energy body     
which is close to me in terms of     
relationship or business. All are not expert in handling     
all kinds of energy sources and     
it is not possible also.    
    
Therefore organizational (family, social, business)     
hierarchy is used to manage the energy of different people.     
One who is on top of the hierarchy     
doesn’t mean he is most competent     
to handle all energy sources.     
He or she can manage all because of the hierarchy.    
    
If we fail in managing someone     
then neither it means we are bad     
not it means the other person is bad.     
It simply means as an individual     
I failed to manage that source of energy.     
And it is fine. All cannot be like a trained bomb diffuser,     
who can diffuse all kinds of bombs.     
Some just know how to handle candlelight.
