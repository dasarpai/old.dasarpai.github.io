We know from our experience     
that all these activities influence     
our health in longer terms and     
decides our mood in the present.    
    
It means the previous set of activities are     
deciding quality of life for the next moment    
    
Pay attention and without altering your actions     
follow your natural flow of actions     
make a note of total A, B, C and Ds     
Do this exercise for one week.     
Observe your data around A, B, C &amp; D.    
    
More A’s you have more free will     
you will experience with respect to taking food.     
More D’s you have more helplessness     
you will experience with respect to taking food    
    
You can apply this framework     
to any activity of your day to day life,     
like talking to someone,     
doing some work in the office,     
doing some physical health-related exercises,     
doing prayer/meditation,     
going to sleep at a particular time,     
waking up from sleep at a particular time.    
    
Without altering your actions     
If you observe your count and pattern of A, B, C, D     
for your various activities then     
you will come to know that     
how much you are in control of your life.     
And how much you can influence the surrounding     
And how much is completely out of your control?    
    
A wise is that who lives with the reality     
First, accept everything     
Then identify which you can change     
Get the courage and energy to change     
what you want to change     
Then change what you can change    
    
Finally, accept what cannot be changed     
Come to terms with those forces in life     
Which are out of your control    
    
And know from your experience that     
what I am today is not 100% choices of forces around me     
What I am is today is mostly made by my choices     
It is different that I failed to recognize those choices     
and exercise the free will     
at different moments of my life.    
    
The creator has designed     
this cosmos in such a way,     
That for a human, who has a possibility to live a conscious life     
There is the least helplessness.    
    
For other animals in this world     
who has the least self-awareness     
Most of life is a compulsive behavior    
    
For human most of life is     
a consequence of his or her choices     
and not the choice of someone     
who is sitting in Sky and counting     
how many breaths we have taken     
so that we can be called back.    
    
O Pratibimba, do I have free will is a wrong question!     
How much self-aware I am     
so that I can choose needs to inquired by each Jeeva.    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Your Truly Hari
