# Efforts to Become Happy and Joyful    
      
We work hard to learn and earn.     
This learning and earning helps us buying comfort in life     
     
We think comfortable things makes us happy     
We forget there is very weak relationship between     
Having comfortable things around and being happy     
     
No matter how much we read and learn     
No matter how we have and earn     
Happiness come from understanding life     
And joy comes from happiness.     
     
Understanding of the world and relationships around.     
Knowledge of how to deal with the circumstances and people around.     
Helps us in becoming joyful.     
     
If you can know and understand your own mind     
Control that better rather than pleasing it all time and giving all what it need     
Then it is like, you stop spoiling an adamant child     
No matter how much we give them     
They always behave in a particular way.     
Mind is like that.     
     
Happiness is a habit of mind.     
You can never make it happy by you eternal efforts of learning and working     
Because all these efforts are in opposite direction of your existence     
     
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Yours Truly Hari
