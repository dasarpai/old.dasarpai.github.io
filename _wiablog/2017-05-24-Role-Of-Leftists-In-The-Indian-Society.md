# Role Of Leftists In The Indian Society
    
Unit of an idea is a thought     
A thought of love, respect, value, care, preservation, etc.     
Let’s call this X thought.     
Or thought of disrespect, discouragement, carelessness, demolition, etc.     
Let’s call this Y thought.    
    
Based on our understanding of life,     
the environment around and our value system,     
We may choose to apply X thought     
or Y thought on the concepts of     
nation, a particular religion, caste of people, color of people,     
geography of people, nationality of people,     
praying method of people, and the belief system of the people.    
    
With that thought process, we level     
the people, religion, culture, and societies around.     
If we are powerful and dictator then     
we can enforce and spread our idea to the masses     
And force them to follow our idea     
or tell them to be ready to lose their life.    
    
If we are democratic then we use another method     
to enforce and spread our idea to the masses.     
If certain people don’t follow my ideas then     
We outcast them or keep trying with them     
till the time we are living or other is alive.    
    
Human society will always have different kinds of mind     
Sometimes these minds are so much radical to each other     
That, it looks one will survive only if the second die.     
For that, they use their God-given purpose     
as proof of their righteousness and finish others.    
    
Nothing wrong with having different ideas     
Or sometimes extremely opposite ideas     
Nothing wrong in crying to protect our ideas     
Nothing wrong with working hard     
and trying to convince others that my idea is the best idea.    
    
But try all with some logic, some common sense, some humanity.     
Show others the benefits of your ideas.     
Do not threaten people.     
Do not use your power of any kind     
to suppress permanently to an individual or a society.    
    
If thought can be measured on an infinite scale from left to right     
On the left side, we can keep Y thoughts     
and on the right side, we can put X thoughts.     
Start applying these X &amp; Y thoughts     
to the concept of nation, religion or a certain religion,     
or certain cast, geography or certain geography of people, etc    
    
Once you are done then     
locate the center on this scale     
Do this with your own perspective     
And then with someone’s perspective, who you don’t like     
You will find there is no center.     
There are hater and lovers of every idea.    
    
Leftists are an integral part of liberal societies     
You will find them in all the democratic nations     
Democratic planes are the only land where this crop can grow.    
    
But if you compare the leftists of different nations     
you will find some similarities.     
They are liberal, anti-religion, humanist, modernist, etc.    
    
Interestingly, if you analyze the leftist of Bharat     
they have a unique quality,     
Which none of other country’s leftist have     
Leftist in the Bharat is against the idea of a nation,     
patriotism, grand narrative of Bharat and anti majority.    
    
So on a thought quality scale, you will find     
Leftist of the world are centrist and     
Rightists of the world are on the extreme right.     
Therefore to bring balance in a society Leftists are required.    
    
But, the leftists of India are extreme left or extreme right.     
Rightists of India are centrist.     
Do you think this is by chance?    
    
No! It is characteristic of Hindu Dharma     
Listen to all ideas, concepts, philosophies,     
question, discuss, debate with others,     
Convince them or get convinced.    
    
Then with new ideas and concepts     
realign the center again     
And keep moving     
Never become rigid     
So, in Indian society, what looks left or right     
at some points in time     
Hindu dharma traditions make sure to align themself     
And masses of the Bharat lives in the center.    
    
So the role which leftist play in other parts of the world     
is not available in the land of Bharat     
Because Acharyas, Gurus, Renounced Individuals (sadhus) play that role.    
    
But, if Gurus or Acharya, Sadhus of the Bhartiya society     
compromise on their role then leftists try to take that space     
That is one of the reasons why leftists are against     
our Gurus, Acharyas, Sadhus because in their presence     
Leftists are not having the role of bringing rights to the center.
