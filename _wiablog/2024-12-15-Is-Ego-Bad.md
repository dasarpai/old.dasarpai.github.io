![Is Ego Bad?](/assets/images/wiapost/5274-Is-Ego-Bad.jpg)

**Is Ahamkar Bad?**

First, we need to understand.  
The Sanskrit word "Ahamkara"  
is not the same as "ego."  
Similarly, the Hindi word "Ghamand"  
is not the same as "proud."  

Those who know Hindi understand,  
"Ghamand" is bad, but pride is good.  
Similarly, having Ahamkara is fine.  
But having an ego is the problem.  

Ahamkara means putting yourself first.  
This is not a bad thing.  
The problem arises when you think  
there is another, second to you.  

In fact, the greatest Ahamkara can be:  
"I am Brahman, I am the only one.  
There is no second.  
I am the cause of the cosmos.  
I am the cause of everything.  
Without me, nothing works.  

Even the Sun doesn't rise,  
Earth doesn't move,  
Stars cannot stay in the sky."  

If you reach this highest Ahamkara,  
through experience and understanding,  
well done! What else do you need?  

The problem is thinking  
that a clump of earth, fire, air, and water—  
what you call the body—  
is the cause of everything.  

If this is not foolishness,  
then what is?

Those who think Nature is everything,  
body is everything, manisfested world is everthing,   
and all other are human made up ideas.  
They miss the real, the truth, the existence.  
The problem is not denial,  
But the problem is stop seeking.

**The Real Question**  

The question is not  
if Ahamkara is good or bad.  
The real question is about  
the tricks humans develop  
to survive beyond the body.  

Humans do not want to die.  
They fear losing everything—  
relationships, money, power,  
or whatever they have acquired.  

This fear of losing  
drives their actions.  

Humans cling tightly  
to what they value—  
wealth, fame, relationships.  
But ask yourself:

**The Nature of Loss**  

In millions of years of human history,  
who has remained here since birth?  

Whoever is born will die.  
Whoever has acquired will lose.  
Whatever is acquired will go away.  

This is true  
whether you have ego or not, is not important.  

Death does not care  
if you have ego.  
It does not care  
if you are rich or poor.  
Famous or unknown,  
death takes everyone equally.  

Time—Kaala—Samaya will turn everything  
you value into dust.  

No matter how much you hold,  
it will eventually fade.

**Ego as a Social Issue**  

If ego is a problem,  
it is a Dharmik or social issue.  
It affects the person with ego,  
and the society around them.  

But ego has nothing to do  
with spirituality or immortality.  
It has no connection to  
Sat-Tattva or Atma-Tattva.  

Whether you have ego or not,  
you will die.  
Whether you have ego or not,  
your acquisitions will fade.  
Whatever you love will leave you.

This fear of loss matters.  
To address it, people say:  
"Don’t be egoistic."  

But avoiding ego out of fear  
is not wisdom.  
It only makes people  
pretend to have no ego.

**Why You Shouldn’t Be Egoistic**  

You should not avoid ego  
because you fear loss and death.  

Instead, avoid ego  
because it is foolish way of living.  

No matter how much you have—  
money, power, knowledge—  
if you have ego,  
you are still a fool.  

Why? Because you have  
not understood life.  

Even after gaining so much,  
you still think avoiding ego  
will help you escape loss or death.  

This is the real foolishness.

Yours Truely Hari
