# Journey Of The Siddhartha
    
The world around us has mysterious ways,     
to teach some deeper lessons of life.     
In ancient time there was a Siddhartha     
He was a prince and had all luxuries     
At his disposal to enjoy the life     
But, he saw suffering and Dukkha     
In a certain way of living     
and started a journey     
to free from the clutches of Dukkha.     
And he became The Siddhartha, The Buddha.    
    
Then a came time when     
Mother started naming their children     
Siddhartha, Buddha, Tathagat     
They thought their child will live     
like a feather, untouched from the gravity     
of the suffering from the world around.    
    
All kind of education and training was     
Given to children so that they can live     
A wiser life than their older generation lived     
But, where is The Buddha in us?    
    
Society has seen many great people in the last 2500 years     
but a name who had everything of the world     
and chose to live life with nothing is nowhere.     
Was Siddhartha a fool to choose that way of life?    
    
New age Siddhartha choosing the reverse way of living     
From beggar to the king, nothing to everything     
Unknown name to omnipresent name     
After earning all this,     
One day, disappear all of sudden.    
    
O Pratibimba! I want to know     
What is wrong with the new age Siddhartha?     
Is success that bad?     
Is money so bad?     
Is working hard for making life better bad?     
Is working for passion is bad?     
Is greed bad?     
Is a desire to be the best, the first in the world bad?     
Older Siddhartha has taught us Nirvaan marga     
New Siddhartha is teaching us what?    
    
Pratibimba is sad and silent today     
Not spoken any word to me     
But, I am realizing nothing of the above is bad     
After all, in this world, there are many kinds of people     
who live and finally leave one day     
Some ceremoniously some unceremoniously     
How will a person depart,     
this is in the hand of the unknown.    
    
But try to live in a sensible way     
A way of Middle Path, Madhya Maarga     
Which come from the teaching of Older Siddhartha     
But new Siddhartha chose to ignore     
Being in business, profession, family     
We need to understand the messages     
From both the Siddharthas.    
    
What is the message of Siddhartha VG left for us?    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Yours Truly Hari
