# Solution of Inside Problem is not Outside

When your mind is weary, burdened and low,   
Defeated, exhausted, where do you go?   
Lonely, sad, with shadows that cling,   
You know this life is not the song you sing.   
   
But who is it, this "you" who feels the pain,   
Who yearns for peace, to be whole again?   
   
You turn to the world, seek comfort outside,   
Music, games, a fleeting tide.   
A talk with a friend, a laugh, a show,   
A party, a drink, where troubles don’t grow.   
Smoke to numb, to quiet the mind,   
But all these are fleeting, a refuge unkind.   
   
To solve the ache, we grasp at straws,   
Marriage, jobs, children: to solve life’s grand cause.   
But as we age, the problems swell,   
No external balm can break the spell.   
   
O Chaitanya, for the wounds within, we seek in vain,   
External cures for internal pain.   
A bandage it is, not a cure so true,   
The answer lies deeper, within you.   
Seek the solution and not the solace!
