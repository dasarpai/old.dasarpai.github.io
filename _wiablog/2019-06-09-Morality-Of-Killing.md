## Morality Of Killing

    
Killing is sin and it is immoral.     
What I want to kill is not existing because of my action     
But because of my inaction.    
    
When there is the first cockroach in the house     
I must have handled that properly     
Either by throwing or killing     
But my morality of non-violence didn’t allow that to happen.    
    
Now, the whole family of cockroach has grown in my house     
What will I do now? Massacre!     
Which was better? Nipping when it was bud or doing massacre now?    
    
But why I need to do a massacre?     
Either because of my lethargy     
or because of morality principle     
or because I thought it is too small to fight with.    
    
I cannot remain in a house or in a society     
Without eliminating the weeds     
If I don’t do it someone else has to do that     
If no one does that then     
The whole field become full of weeds and     
I cannot grow anything useful in that field.    
    
So the principle of absolute non-violence     
Will make my house dirty,     
full of mosquito, cockroach, spiders, ants, etc.     
I cannot live in that house any longer.    
    
But if I keep my house clean then     
Every day I have to do a little violence     
And I can avoid a massacre of once in a month or a year.    
    
Daily cleaning or massacre     
Are the only two option to survive     
even in your own house.     
The question is who will do this?     
Either you do it yourself or     
some of your family members does it     
Or you outsource this to somebody.    
    
But we need to understand one thing     
One who is doing cleaning this work is favoring you     
You cannot claim yourself a great disciple     
of Mahatma Gandhi or Mahatma Buddha or Mahavira Jain     
And say, Ahimsa Parmodharmah (Non-violence is the absolute principle)     
Nor you have the right to abuse or downgrade the cleaner.    
    
The same logic can be extended to a society     
When you because lazy, careless or     
try to become the epitome of non-violence     
Then you cause more harm to a society     
You need to be cautious and     
from time to time clean the society     
from unhealthy ideas, thoughts, dogmas,     
hypocrisies, hardcore ideologies, thought of dominance.     
To keep the society alive and vibrant     
either the forces (police, military, etc) need to work     
Or you need to work.     
So that weeds can be kept out.    
    
In a democratic society, it is expected that     
We remain awake all the time     
And kill the unhealthy ideas when they are bud     
Or outsource this work to forces     
But if no one does this then     
Your own home will become a shelter     
for terrorist, antisocial elements,     
anti-national, Lawless, and Adharmic people.    
    
The principle of non-violence applies to friendly elements     
And it is not absolute     
You cannot apply to terrorist, anti-national, robbers     
It simply means do not allow weeds to grow around.    
    
O Pratibimba, do you think it is easy to identify     
which ideas should be killed?     
If a house will belong to snakes     
then ideas of Human has to be killed     
And if the house belongs to human     
then ideas of snakes have to be killed.    
    
But in a democratic society     
who decides who snake and who is human?     
One who spills venom is a snake!    
    
Venom doesn’t kill the snake.     
But others suffer from it.     
We know snakes and humans both     
are suffering in society.     
You decide who is a snake and who is human.     
And then take action to clean your house     
So that you need not see Mahabharat before your eyes.    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Yours Truly Hari
