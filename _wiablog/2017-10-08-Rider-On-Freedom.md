# Rider On Freedom  
     
Is it possible to tame a human mind without religion?    
    
Is it necessary we need to tame a human mind or     
all should have equal freedom to think and do?    
    
Why use dos and don’ts of religion?     
Why use heaven and hell of religion to bring humans to senses?    
    
Is there any relationship between religion and democracy?    
    
Religion wants to control either through ruler or priest.    
    
The democratic system gives freedom     
to think, eat, worship, earn, spend, etc to all its citizens.    
    
In non-democratic societies     
a group of powerful people thinks     
on behalf of their society.    
    
Democracy has many assumptions.     
The first assumption is     
All citizens are matured enough to make     
their decisions for themselves.     
Is this assumption valid?    
    
The second assumption is     
Any decision of one citizen     
does bring joy and problem only for oneself     
So let them do whatever required for their own happiness.     
But does it happens?    
    
But the same democracy doesn’t allow     
citizens to do suicide, rob and cheat others,     
Democracy of a citizen ends     
where the democracy of other citizen starts.    
    
So we have overlapping boundaries     
Which I enjoy, you don’t like,     
Which you enjoy, I don’t like.    
    
So, how to settle in these situations.     
Either in public or private life     
People still chose that age-old tricks     
Exercise the power to force others.     
Power may be of position or senior relations     
or age seniority or money or muscles.    
    
But, in a democracy the tool to settle the issues     
is not any weapon or force or thrashing     
The tool is to open your mouth, discuss, debate, and defend.    
    
Unfortunately all people     
do not have some patience     
and skills to articulate, debate, argue     
Thus they chose either to remain silent or fight physically.     
Both are not good for democracy.    
    
The third assumption in a democracy is     
the citizens are educated     
and can speak effectively on their behalf     
or can hire someone easily who can speak on their behalf.     
But, is this true? Is it easy?    
    
The fourth assumption is democracy is     
Once you are 18 years old     
then you are a citizen of the country     
Now, you have become mature enough     
to think for yourself and make your own decision.     
But does it happens?     
Is our education system     
and social structure makes us matured     
by the time we reach 18?     
Can we really think     
what is good and whatnot for us?    
    
Democratic laws give freedom but put a rider     
If someone misuses that freedom to harm others,     
nation, society, etc then there is a punishment.     
But what is the definition of “misuse”?    
    
Law is taking away that freedom,     
to create your own definition of “misuse”     
Courtroom debates decide what is “misuse”.    
    
Interestingly, either the exerciser of the freedom     
is ignorant or behave like that     
but in reality, there is     
no “real absolute freedom” as per the law.    
    
This freedom is available only to those     
who chose to live wisely     
whether a constitution exists or not.    
    
Because a democratic constitution     
is an unwritten law in nature     
“live and let others live”    
    
Crooked want to interpret that     
as per their whims and fancy     
And suppress others.    
    
Sometimes using the democratic laws     
they are successful in doing so.    
    
That is why in Hindu traditions     
we consider Dharma is over the Law.     
People can manipulate the law of the land     
and get a favorable decision for themselves     
But, the Dharma brings justice for all.    
    
So there are riders for Freedom     
And freedom is available in a democracy     
But you fail to get freedom either     
because someone crooked you or     
you were too weak or too fragile     
to protect yourself then Dharma delivers that justice.    
    
O wise reader, Freedom, Democracy, Education,     
Boldness to defend yourself and Fearlessness     
all cyclical are interrelated.     
Think yourself, from where you want to start.    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Yours Truly Hari
