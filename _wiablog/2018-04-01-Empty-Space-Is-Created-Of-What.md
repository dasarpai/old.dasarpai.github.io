# Empty Space Is Created Of What?
       
To see the objects, places, and events     
we keep running in the world from one place to another.     
After reaching the place     
or having thing around     
we rotate 360 degrees around,     
up and down the object or the place,     
if possible break and peep inside and     
this is the way to know the world around you.     
It gives joy to humans. It is the human way.    
    
Open space around you or in the sky     
is not empty, neither we can that it is not made     
We neither can say it is made of nothing    
    
Sit calmly in some open place.     
See at 3 feet distance in the air or open space.     
Mark one cubic inch space in the open space before you.     
Without seeing anything just that space.    
    
Virtually mark that area as airtight and     
assume there is no air and no other particle in that area.     
Only light and radiations present there.     
Now just see the light and space     
in that area and nothing else.    
    
Do you think to know this area     
you need to rotate yourself 360 degrees,     
up down around this area?     
Of course not! You will say.    
    
Think what is that of which     
this empty space and light are made of.     
If you see this space for 5 minute     
then think is space same     
which did you see 5 min before?    
    
Space before you has 3 dimensions,     
I am not talking about 3 dimensions of an object,     
I am talking about 3 dimensions of empty space.     
from where those 3 dimensions come?    
    
Is there any other dimension     
in that cubic inch space     
from which 3-dimensional space has taken birth?     
It is possible that there are billions of other life existing     
in that 1 cubic inch space that you marked airtight?    
    
Do not say you arenâ€™t able to see the light and space     
without seeing the objects around.     
To penetrate the space     
you need a sharper tool than space itself.     
To see the photon of light     
you need different light than     
the light which shows the objects around.    
    
Without being philosopher     
Think, which mind can see the creator of the space and     
the content of the Light which reveals the world around?
