# Eyes On The Ground   
       
Whether I walk, jog or run     
If I have continuous eyes on the ground     
I will not fall because of environmental reasons.    
    
I may still fall but the cause will be     
either my weak limbs or my foolishness.     
But I am happy with this,     
because I am in control     
and I know my happiness     
and miseries are 100% my doing.    
    
If I keep eyes on the ground     
then I will be able to travel     
long with least tiredness     
because there is no competition     
and I am not walking by seeing others.    
    
If I keep my eyes on the ground     
then no drain out of energy in jealousy     
or a sense of achievement that     
I have done it first, faster, and better.    
    
If I keep eyes on the ground     
then no one can irritate me,     
because I do not know that     
others are traveling with me.     
I am lonely enjoying the journey     
without a need of showing off,     
proving, becoming first.    
    
If I keep eyes on the ground     
then I will not hurt those     
who is on the ground?    
    
If I keep eyes on the ground     
then I may miss the destination     
but the journey will be joyful.    
    
Reaching or not reaching the destination     
is not 100% in my control.     
Therefore, if I keep eyes on the destination     
then the journey is also going to be     
full of anxieties and worries.    
    
Yes, journey and destination both are important.     
Yes, life and goal in life both are important.     
Therefore, sometimes for better tomorrow     
we sacrifice today and some people say     
it is a wise way of living.    
    
Other times we do not want to let     
the current moment go.     
For the unseen but promising future     
why should we lose the moment in our hands     
So let us live the fullest in the present     
and this is also a wise way.    
    
But whatever we do,     
keeping eyes on the ground helps to live the moment.     
Even to fly I need to be in touch with the ground.    
    
O Pratibimba, wise people say strike a balance between     
present and future, journey and goal     
ground and sky, near and far     
going to the extreme will cause you pain and suffering.     
But knowing this “balance” is not easy.     
What do you say Pratibimba?
