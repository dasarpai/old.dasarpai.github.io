## Human Peace   
       
Information has become abundant     
and it is free through search engines like Google, bing, yahoo etc.    
    
Knowledge has become abundant     
and free through Wikipedia, quora etc.    
    
Energy is becoming abundant through nuclear, wind, solar, etc.    
    
Communication has become abundant     
through new mobile communication technologies.    
    
Entertainment has become abundant through YouTube, netflix, imdb, etc.    
    
Public feedback has become abundant through Rottdntomato, glassdoor, etc.    
    
Transportation will be ten times cheaper in the future,     
because of electric autonomous vehicles.    
    
The only thing humanity is missing is 'how to live in a wiser way'.     
Technology is solving all external problems     
and making solutions easy.     
But no external technology and techniques can teach humans     
to be peaceful in her/his inner space of living.     
This is self-strife without any external technology support.     
The second way is to get the company of someone     
who lives an internally peaceful life,     
sit with him/her without talking about any businesses or daily affair news.    
    
Wisdom cannot be acquired or transferred.     
It is one's non-transferable intellectual property.     
This is accumulated by self-reflection and observation.
