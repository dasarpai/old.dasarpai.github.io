# Biological Footprint of Human   
        
Birds fly in the sky without footprint,    
Animals cannot walk on the earth without a footprint.    
Those who want to fly don't create a nest to live but to rest.    
Those who want to walk create a den and die in those dens.    
    
Death happen to birds also    
But, their living noticed by everyone     
and death known to none.    
Death happens to animal also    
They leave a rotten body behind     
for other animals to eat.    
    
Humans create lots of fuss    
Before they leave the planet     
they leave thousands of footprints of different types    
cloths, shoes, pots, electronics,     
ideologies, dogmas, buildings.    
They want other people     
should notice their departure    
But for what?    
    
The biological footprint     
which they created have left havoc here.    
The spiritual footprints     
which they left here     
inspired others to live a sensible life.    
But this is questionable,     
because their followers fight here like animals.
