## Human And His Faith

    
If you look at life deeper,     
There is no other purpose of life other than to live.     
We make a purpose, work hard for it,     
If the purpose is fulfilled, then celebrate it,     
But that purpose is Human created!    
    
The creator doesn’t have any purpose.     
The creator is playing.     
The purpose of play is nothing but to play.     
Win or lose against someone is a human purpose.     
The creator does not have anyone against whom     
The creator needs to compete.     
The creator is alone and the lonely player.     
We all creatures are being used by Creator to play.    
    
It is like, you are alone in a forest and most powerful there.     
You live there and play there.     
But animals in the kingdom think that     
this person has a purpose     
that is why he does certain things     
one day and other things on the other days.    
    
Lila of the Creator is such that     
you will never know what the Creator is trying to do.     
The only way to know Creator is to think like Him.    
    
With respect to the existence of the Creator.     
There are the following types of people in the world    
    
1\. Those, who believe there is no Creator.     
Like many self-made successful educated people,     
who think that they struggled hard     
to achieve and to become what they are.    
    
2\. Those, who don’t know there is something like Creator.     
An unaltered naive small child is like this.    
    
3\. Those, who don’t bother about Creator.     
People busy enough with their work are like this.    
    
4\. Those, who bother too much about Creator     
and want to influence him in their favor. Like a trader.    
    
5\. Those, who bother too much about the creator     
and believe Creator is very powerful     
and that Creator cannot be changed     
so don’t spend time making him happy.     
Just be careful while living.    
    
6\. Those, who don’t bother about their work or life     
but only about Creator’s work.     
What creator should do or what he should have done.    
    
7\. Those, who think Creator has a purpose     
and whole life thinking what may be the purpose of the Creator.    
    
8\. Those, who know Creator is there     
and know it from their experience     
and not from books and imagination of their mind.    
    
From your experience do you know     
any other Types of Human Being based on their Faith,     
or with respect to their thought about the creator?

Yours Truly Hari
