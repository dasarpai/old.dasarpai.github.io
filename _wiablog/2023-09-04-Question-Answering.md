# Questioning & Answering (Problem Solving)    
    
When we are searching on internet or   
engaging with people and asking them a question  
We get incomplete answer or incorrect answer    
because we do not ask correct question    
(actual question is different than the problem in hand)    
or question is not complete   
or we exploring the answer at inappropriate place   
or we are asking that question too early   
(society around is not ready to undersand you)   
this leads to incomplete or incorrect answer.

Our questions are not complete or correct or appropriate    
because we do not know the full context or    
we are unable to comprehend the problem for which we are asking question   

We do not know the full context or    
unable to comprehend the problem    
because we are in hurry to solve the problem or    
there is another problem and in our mind we are solving that problem    
and physically engaged in something else or    
we are not interested in solving the problem    
but we want to do something else    
that is more enjoyable than this problem solving   
We are just passing time waiting for something else.
