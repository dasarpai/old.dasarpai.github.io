## About Silence And Listening

    
Hearing is a **natural phenomenon** to normal ears.     
Listening is a **conscious phenomenon** from a willing mind.     
It is possible that with a normal ear I can hear but not listen.     
And it is also possible that with a deaf ear I may not hear but listen.    
    
When our mind is busy talking     
or preparing to talk for our turn     
We miss the point,     
because we couldn’t listen.    
    
We may not listen     
when nothing is being said     
And we may not listen     
when people are shouting at us.    
    
We can listen when     
we are sensitive to the voiceless.     
We may listen when     
we are cooking assumptions in our minds.    
    
We may not need a doctor to tell us,     
what has happened to us     
If we can listen directly from our body,     
but do we have that mind, who listens?     
All-time chattering mind can not listen.    
    
We don’t need a judge to tell us that     
we have done injustice     
If we can listen directly     
from our conscience     
that this is the time to take punishment.     
But are we that much honest?     
A prejudiced mind cannot listen.    
    
Can our surrounding talk to us?     
Of course, without an instrument of speaking,     
Tree, wall, street, plants, and objects     
in our surroundings can talk to us!    
    
How do we know they are talking?     
Sound is the vibration in the medium     
which we can hear all the time but     
An insensitive mind misses listening.    
    
When a frequency is too low     
we are not able to pay attention to listen.     
It is like listening to a mute person     
We need to listen with a lot of patience    
    
But this skill payback a lot     
Because a surrounding     
which is tongueless     
Always vibrates the Truth     
And this helps us knowing our truth as well.    
    
If we can tune to the objects of the surrounding     
then we can listen to the truth from     
the food on our plate     
the Moorthi at Pooja alter     
the Photo on the wall     
the Objects in the room     
the Tree on the way and     
From the flower in a garden.    
    
A sound can be voice or music or noise     
But, what is the difference among all these?    
    
Voice belongs to life.     
Music belongs to instruments and nature.     
And noise is multiple voices and music     
get mixed up and humans not able to make sense.    
    
Voice and music makes sense only     
When it is coming from the silence     
But when voice and music is coming     
with another voice and music     
then it is noise and not music!     
You cannot enjoy that longer.    
    
The sound which comes to our ear     
Which is created by public festivals or prayers,     
May be music or noise     
It depends upon our state of mind or faith     
For some, it is pleasing, and for     
other it may be entertaining or     
and for the rest, it may be paining.    
    
Have you spent some night or day     
In a forest or near a forest?     
All the insets and birds are talking aloud     
In a rhythmic way     
We cannot understand the voice     
but we enjoy the rhythm.    
    
Have you ever sat under the tree     
When slow air is flowing?     
There is a sound from the leaves of the tree     
This is a music of nature     
We may not understand but we enjoy that.    
    
Have you ever sat at the bank of a slow-flowing river?     
There is a sound of water,     
lives in the water jumping on the surface     
and creating a music     
And it soothes our mind    
    
Have you ever thought     
Who is the mother of the sound?    
    
What did you say?     
The object which is making a sound?     
oh, then you missed the point.     
It comes from silence!    
    
More the silence better the sound     
Between the silence, there is a small sound     
we notice that which is between silence     
And miss that in which sound is packed.     
Silence is omnipresent,     
It does not live in the sound     
Sound lives in silence    
    
Can you listen when you keep speaking?     
The more you speak less you listen.    
    
So, you listen when there is silence.     
The silence of a mind is called peace.     
The silence of an environment which we enjoy     
is called the rhythm and beat of nature.     
A rhythm of flowing air, chirping birds,     
running water, and dancing fire.    
    
Between two sounds in the surrounding     
Between two thoughts in the mind     
There is silence.     
In fact, this silence is so universal that     
We can say that between the two intervals of silences     
there is a spike of sound and spike of thought.    
    
Without listening to anything     
from the surrounding     
Without listening to any sound     
from your own mind     
Can you listen to a possibility     
of music in the silence?    
    
Silence is mother of Sound,     
It is like darkness.     
From silence all sound takes shape.     
Frequency is the shape of the sound.    
    
From darkness even light takes shape.     
Frequency is the shape of light.     
And in the presence of light     
objects in their shapes are visible    
    
Sound can be identified only     
when it displaces the silence     
Light can be praised only     
when it displaces darkness     
Without darkness and silence,     
what is light and what is sound?    
    
What is that which is all pervasive in existence?     
Even present at the place     
where the light of the sun     
can’t reach in the sky.     
And no air exists?     
It is darkness and silence.    
    
What is that on the back of which     
light and sound play like a child?     
It is mother who is dark, Kaali     
It is father who is silence, Shiva    
    
Our non stop talking and     
showing off to others,     
Make us sick to ourselves     
and to others around us.    
    
Thus take a rest while     
keeping body on the lap of Kaali     
And head on the lap of Shiva.    
    
Have you ever thought     
In the night when you get extremely tired     
and fall on the bed.     
What is that which picks you immediately     
from your body     
and takes you to a no man’s land     
And in the morning     
drop you back again in your body?    
    
Just after waking up     
From a deep sleep     
someday ask yourself     
where were you two minutes back?    
    
And in answer don’t refer     
to the body and say I was here on the bed     
but refer to one who enjoyed     
the travel to noman’s land     
In silence and darkness    
    
O Pratibmba, one who could listen     
and enjoy the music of silence     
Can communicate with unmanifest     
Can communicate with unfolded time     
Can know the formless cause of creation.    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Your Truly Hari
