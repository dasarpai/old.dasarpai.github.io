# A Witness Of The Transformation   
    
On far top-hill either water getting heated     
and then you see the vapors in the sky or     
something is burning on the ground and     
the smoke is in the sky?If you observing from the far distance     
it is not that easy for you to know that     
what kind of transformation is happening on the hill.    
In one wood is burning and eventually finished     
nothing will be left after some time.    
    
In another water is becoming cloud     
it will come back again in the form of rain.    
Both transformations have their importance and significance.    
     
In one, you need to completely destroy your old and     
in other, you need to give directions     
to the same energy for other higher causes.    
But the people sitting far will not know it     
until either, they experience the rain or     
they experience the ashes on their fingers.     
Shall we bother about this?    
    
Transformation is more important or     
people seeing our process of transformation?
