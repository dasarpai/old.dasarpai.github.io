## What Kind Of Education?

    
Religious education teaches you     
relative morality, rituals, and traditions.     
It forces you to believe     
in the knowledge of books as “the” truth     
and your traditions are “the” most useful, practical     
and others’ are just childish or outdated.    
    
Currently prevailed secular education     
teaches us how to extract     
the maximum joy from the resource,     
people, nature, and systems around us.     
The teaching is so focused on the extraction     
that student misses many important lessons     
but remember just one.    
    
We need to ask ourselves,     
if we could have understood     
physics, chemistry, and maths     
of the high school properly     
then would we have lived the way we are living?    
    
What is that education system     
which can metamorphoses     
a natural, selfish, greedy, egoistic,     
lusty, jealous, angry animal-human to divinely human?    
    
In the age of sophisticated weapons     
killing Ravan is very easy.     
Identifying, locating, and making him convinced     
that he is Ravan is extremely difficult.    
    
Because for that we need to be     
an unblemished character like Rama.     
This is possible only in self-start mode.
