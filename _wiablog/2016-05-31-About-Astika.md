# About Astika   
    
Astika word come from a “as” “अस्” dhaato (root word)     
of the Samskrut (संस्कृत) language.     
It means “is”, “is-ness”, “reality of existence”, “being”     
It has nothing to do with belief. It is about reality.    
    
Believe means which I have not seen or experienced personally,     
And many people around me are talking about it,     
And I need to choose a side so that I don’t look odd in public, thus I have 4 options.     
1\. Either I believe with the people around or     
2- disbelief or     
3- be specious or     
4- be a seeker.     
And you need different mental metal for being     
either of these four regarding the subject in question.     
I will write about this topic on some other day.    
    
So, is-ness is about Astika.     
Now think about the term Astika?     
In my experience, there are 5 main categories     
(In categories I am little differing from the books of ancient wisdom,     
the reason for that is to connect with you)     
1\. World (samsara),     
2\. Scriptural Knowledge (Vedas),     
3\. God (collective one life),     
4\. Jeeva (individual life),     
5\. My Existence (Ahamkara)     
We will talk about all these in this order only    
    
**1. World, 2. Vedas, 3. God, 4. Jeeva, 5. Ahamkar**     
1\. Astika, 2. Astika, 3. Astika, 4. Astika, 5. Astika.     
It means experientially I am settled for all 5 entities.     
It means I am Poorna Astika.    
    
**1. World, 2. Vedas, 3. God, 4. Jeeva, 5. Ahamkar**     
1\. Astika, 2. Astika, 3. Astika, 4. Astika, 5. Nastika.     
Experientially I am settled for only 4 entities.     
It means experientially, I know that my Ahamkara does not exist.     
Is there this kind of person in the world? What do you call them? Bhakta?    
    
**1. World, 2. Vedas, 3. God, 4. Jeeva, 5. Ahamkar**     
1\. Astika, 2. Astika, 3. Nastika, 4. Astika, 5. Astika     
It means Experientially, I know that God (collective consciousness of the cosmos)     
doesn’t exist and everything exists.     
Are there these kinds of people in the world? What do you call them? Iswara Nastika?    
    
**1. World, 2. Vedas, 3. God, 4. Jeeva, 5. Ahamkar**     
1\. Astika, 2. Nastika, 3. Astika, 4. Astika, 5. Astika     
It means experientially, I know that Vedas are false and everything that exists is true.     
Are there these kinds of people in the world? What do you call them? Ved Nastika?    
    
**1. World, 2. Vedas, 3. God, 4. Jeeva, 5. Ahamkar**     
1\. Nastika, 2. Astika, 3. Astika, 4. Astika, 5. Astika     
It means experientially, I know that World does not exist (it is illusion) and everything that exists is true.     
Are there these kinds of people in the world? What do you call them? Confused?    
    
**1. World, 2. Vedas, 3. God, 4. Jeeva, 5. Ahamkar**     
1\. Nastika, 2. Astika, 3. Astika, 4. Nastika, 5. Nastika     
Are there these kinds of people in the world? What do you call them? Veda &amp; Ishwara Astika.    
    
This way there are 32 possible combinations.     
In those first is Sampoorna Astika and last is Sampoorna Nastika.     
I am not sure who can come in front and say I am Sampoorna Nastika.     
That person must be a complete lost case.    
    
Next time when you meet somebody     
and say I am Nastika or Astika     
And you are completely opposite to that person     
then don’t climb upon his/her head to prove you are right.     
Learn from his/her experience that how     
come she/he is such kind of person     
when there were other possibilities.    
    
So in the future do not fall into the     
the trap of English word believer or non-believer.     
This is a complete Western word,     
I will try to explain that in the future.    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Your Truly Hari
