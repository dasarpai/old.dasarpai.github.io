# No Universal Teachings
    
To live a meaningful and joyful life     
Context is the key for wise one,    
    
The environment around us is comprised of     
People, government, society, traditions,     
weather, and the faith of different people     
This all have some kind of temperament,     
style attitude and behavior.     
All these do not have one unambiguous     
nonoverlapping Language.    
    
They all express their deeper experiences,     
pride, supremacy, superiority     
and the desire to dominate or survive.     
This expression takes shape in the form     
of their words and their actions    
    
It is rare to find a person who is     
Rich in experience, good in intention,     
mine of words and fearless in expressing.     
But in every age, there are a few people     
Who are rich in all these qualities     
And they choose to express     
the truth experienced in the words.     
People around them document their words     
And then spread the teachings     
of those master or wise people    
    
Named are given to those     
poetical or prosaic texts like     
Vachana, Vaani, Geeta, Bible, Quran, Dohe, Sloka     
Their follower think it is the ultimate teaching     
of their Guru, messenger, and prophet     
For them, that is the final word from heaven.     
For all the time of past, present, and future     
For all the lives of all spaces either earth or water or sky    
    
We always live in a world     
where everything is experienced     
in relativity or relationship of other objects around.    
    
Can you know tall, big, good, sacred, light,     
holy without second around?     
Any time a second is required to compare.    
    
Experiencer’s values, traditions, methods,     
culture, food is always better for him     
This is the way of wise.    
    
The moment a person thinks     
It is irrelevant, illogical he will drop that.    
    
Families, Societies, cultures     
and states take a longer time to drop those.    
    
But any sensible group of people     
will not hold to wrong or irrelevant for longer and follow that.    
    
Followers think their book contains     
The ultimate teaching     
of their master or God so they continue.    
    
In this relative existence     
no one can have experience     
of the absolute, ultimate and non-dual     
The degree of experience duality     
or absoluteness can vary but all know     
I am here and the world is there.    
    
Do you know any person     
in past or present who     
Knew the surrounding     
in this non dual absolute way     
and could live always in that experience.    
    
Who knew himself like no boundary around!     
Who knew he is here and everywhere!     
Who knew that he don’t exist     
And only environment exists!     
Who knew that only he exists     
and there is no second!    
    
In this relative world of existence     
Wise people are not bothered     
much about the future than the present     
So they tell based on     
the moment of living,     
based on the time and space in which they live.     
They always solve the problem of the present.    
    
This is the reason     
when we refer the text after their departure     
We find contraction between     
The texts of different wise people     
And the different interpretation of the same textbook     
by the different Guru.    
    
The biggest message can be     
Live a sensible life     
Understand the context     
Avoid generalizing knowledge     
Avoid putting labels and concluding.    
    
Because till there is last life in the cosmos     
There are infinite possibilities for that life     
What that life can become no one can tell     
What that life should do no one can force     
After all who knows human intentions?    
    
People based on their conviction     
Takes excerpts of the text     
From different people and books     
Weave a story and try to tell us     
their personal truth as     
the absolute and ultimate Truth and Teaching.    
    
Therefore no matter what book you refer     
Always look at the current context     
And the situation in which something is said     
By the Gurus in past.    
    
Never do blind copying and pasting of the text     
of experts and realized ones     
Unless it is a law of nature.    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Yours Truly Hari
