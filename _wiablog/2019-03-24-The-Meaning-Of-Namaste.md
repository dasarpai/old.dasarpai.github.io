# The Meaning Of Namaste
    
“नम्” धातु + ङे प्रत्यय = नम:+ते= नमस्ते     
नम् means bow down     
ते means to you or for you    
    
Why should I bow down to you?     
Because you are senior to me?     
Elder to me? More knowledgeable than me?     
Higher in Ashrma to me?     
Wealthier than me?     
Powerful than me?”    
    
What if I don’t bow down to you?     
you will not favor me?     
you will not bless me?     
you will not give me what I want?     
you will not give me which is rightfully mine?     
you will take away from me which I have?     
you can become angry with me?     
you will not love me?     
you will not respect me?    
    
In a worldly sense the meaning and intent     
of Namaste is summarized as above.     
So people do Namaste because of the reasons mentioned above.    
    
In a worldly sense, it is a duty, ritual, karma     
which you do to please or     
break ice to establish the communication.    
    
**But, in spiritual communication it means**     
I bow down to you because     
Through my bodily existence     
I have realized the same reality in your bodily existence.    
    
I live in this body and you live in that body     
But, I am living more consciously     
so I could notice your body around me     
and then one universal reality in your body     
so I say Namaste before you say to me.    
    
You could not have said it     
Because either you are too much busy to notice my presence or     
Too full in your mind to understand     
and identify that one universal oneness.    
    
Or do not care about my presence     
or too much full to feel that your body     
has more power and money possession than I have.    
    
Or looking for an opportunity to punish me     
or too much engrossed in Samadhi     
that you did’t experience any world around     
but only one pure consciousness and     
in that state of wisdom the action, actioner     
and actionee all are one in your experience.    
    
O Pratibimba, does Salaam, Good Morning,     
Hi and Hello has the same     
meaning and intent?
