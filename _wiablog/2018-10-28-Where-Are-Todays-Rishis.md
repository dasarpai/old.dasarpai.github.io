# Where Are Todays Rishis   
       
All Sciences, particle physics, and quantum physics     
in particular, tells us some truth of this cosmos.     
But they also tell us,     
it is too complex to understand     
but we are still trying     
with thousands of brilliant minds and     
hundreds of supercomputers, internet, AI and     
investment of many billion dollars.    
    
Spiritual, philosophical, and “darshan” texts     
(not religious or historical texts)     
also tells us some truth of the cosmos.    
    
Scientists are still trying     
to understand and explain.     
Do you think the work of Rishis,     
philosophers is over?    
    
They tried to explain their subjective truth     
using entertaining stories and     
finally said language is the biggest barrier,     
so experience it on your own.    
    
Now when people go for an experience     
they do not have anything else     
other than the characters of those stories.    
    
As long characters are working     
so long is good but,     
when people have problems and     
story characters are not able     
to solve their problems     
they say all stories are mythological     
there is no truth and no help available.    
    
But Rishi knew that     
characters are created by them     
to explain which is not easy to understand.     
So what are we telling now?     
We are wiser and     
we have figured out     
which those Rishis couldn’t figure out?    
    
Finally, where are Rishis of 21st century     
who are trying to experience, understand and     
explain this subjective truth.    
    
It looks surrounding is full of     
entertaining storytellers     
who are repeating the same old stories?    
    
It has some significance but     
today’s generation is interested     
in something which is more than stories but     
they don’t have more time     
than 5 seconds to read 140 characters.    
    
Finally, there are very few serious workers and     
taker of truth rest and is     
fame, awards, recognition, designation,     
marketing, sales, investment, and profits.    
    
Do you think, you need to take forward     
the torch, which was given to us by our Rishis?     
Are you on the path of Rishis?
