# The Mind Is Friend Or Enemy
    
For any human being, his mind is     
either an asset or a huge liability     
Because this is The only and Final thing     
with which one enjoys or suffers,     
bounded or feel liberated in the world.    
    
If a mind associates itself with     
physical things and physical existence,     
like body, house, wealth, stocks,     
relationship, recognition, respect, etc     
then it has shorter joy and long-suffering.    
    
If mind associates itself with non-physical     
like consciousness, purity, compassion, unbounded love     
then it feels lighter, protected, free, and assured.    
    
But the problem is most of the times mind,     
because of constant feed from sense organs,     
associates itself with the physical world     
around and this has its own cost.    
    
Our five sense organs are important for our survival     
but the sense of freedom and bliss does not depend upon these.     
In fact, if we overuse our senses     
to see, to eat, to hear, to feel, to smell     
then it gets more entanglement to the objects     
and wants to go after those objects again and again.    
    
This sucks our energy and time and     
we never get the time nor feel important     
to allocate time to know and experience     
our other dimension of existence.    
    
Thus most of humanity suffers     
because of this great wonderful mind.     
Why? Because we donâ€™t know     
how to handle our own minds.    
    
The mind can be used for both, survival and liberation.     
But sense organs can be used only for survival.     
Do not depend upon your senses for liberation.    
    
Our whole life efforts go on survival and surviving like others,     
But this is called competition.     
So we have made the competition a reality of our existence.     
If survival is the goal of life     
then where is the question of freedom,     
Moksha, liberation, and boundlessness?    
    
Can we use our mind without using our 5 sense organs,     
it means without getting involved in listening,     
tasting, smelling, feeling, seeing a shape, color, and form?    
    
Can we use our mind without getting sticky to memories,     
It means without hooking to the past and future.     
No nostalgia, hallucination, and imagination?    
    
It is not possible if you have not trained yourself rigorously.     
In a little tired state, you will quickly fall asleep.     
And it is not possible with a fresh mind.     
Because a fresh mind wants to out and search more.    
    
But in reality, this is possible and     
we have experienced this state by accident.     
We all have experiences of life     
when we lose a sense of time and space.     
Completely engrossed with an object.     
And engross so much that     
we do not know even our own presence.     
But unfortunately, this experience for most of us     
is accidental not in our control.    
    
Is it possible to live only in the present     
and only with experience?     
It means no accidental jump to past and future     
and no entanglement to the objects of senses.    
    
An absent-minded person is     
completely lost in the past and future,     
even after hearing, seeing at present.     
The mind is an enemy of such a person or not?    
    
But, what do call a person     
who at present willing stops     
entanglement to the objects around,     
not lost in past and future?     
Do not respond to any surrounding events.     
But live in that moment with full awareness and witness.     
The mind is a friend of that person or not?
