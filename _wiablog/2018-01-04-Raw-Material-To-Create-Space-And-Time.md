## Raw Material To Create Space And Time

    
Time (Kaala) is 100% mind’s creation.     
There is no physical time.     
Akasha is the “voidness” of objects.     
But, what Object? Atom or Mango or Table or planet?    
    
All objects are in the space and have space inside.     
So sensory perception of human is different     
and it is different for microbiological being.     
For us, microparticles don’t exist in normal sensory experience     
so there is void and hence Akasha     
That is why we wave our hand in the air     
and say there is nothing.     
But for the microbe, it is not Akasha.    
    
For us, a place where an ant is sitting is not Akasha     
but for a dinosaur that place is Akasha.     
With the advancement of technology     
when we can record even the presence of x-ray     
then it looks theoretically there is no Akasha outside     
because Akasha is full and filled     
by different things and there is no Voidness in Akasha.     
Then comes the time     
when we start seeing inside the object.    
    
Whether wave-particle or planet     
they are made of something.     
If that holds true it gives an opportunity     
for voidness to exist in between the constituents.    
    
But what is that which is not made of anything     
and hence no void inside that.     
That is completely filled     
and this universe is made of that absolute.     
Upanishad discusses this lofty topic in different ways.    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Yours Truly Hari
