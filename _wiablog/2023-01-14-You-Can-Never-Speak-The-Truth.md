# You Can Never Speak The Truth     
    
Human words, grammar, and speech are tools to hide the truth.    
What really exists, you know and experience    
But, if you say anything about that truth then you are hiding some truth.    
    
Truth exists in a certain way.    
It existed even before our languages were developed,     
our civilization has words and grammar to communicate that.    
It exists even today.    
    
When we are telling about this existential truth to some other person.    
We have some intention, we use words    
But in this process no matter how hard we try,    
No matter how efficient or fluent you are in a particular language    
No matter how honest and intelligent we are    
You are telling about the truth.    
You cannot say the complete truth.    
    
If you really want to communicate the truth    
then the best way is use silence.    
But the problem is most of the humanity doesnâ€™t understand this language.    
We don't know any language, that exists without grammar, words and sounds.    
Therefore when we speak, we speak to hide. we speak untruth.    
    
We can observe three kinds of truth around,    
Social truths like, Sun rises in the east,     
helping a poor will get blessing for you, and     
respecting elders will get prosperity and wealth to you.    
    
Cultural truth like Shiva lives in mountains,     
Jesus is the only son of God,     
When you are speaking lie then Saitan is influencing you.    
    
Scientific truth like proton is heavier than an electron,     
nothing travels faster than light,     
gravity on earth is 9.8 m/s^2    
    
Pay deep attention to the above all kinds of truth     
and ask yourself, is it really truth or just a common believe     
that helps all of us, navigating the world around     
but this has nothing to do with existential truth.
