# Understanding Maya 2   
    
When you see sun is rising and settings    
But you know it doesn't    
    
Approx 72 inch is human body height    
One inch in eye size    
One tenth is size of pupil in the eye    
A small dust particle is enough to stop us seeing the world around    
But we can big objects around and compare    
From eyes we know a cow is bigger than a goat    
Goat is bigger than cat    
Cat is bigger than mouse    
Mouse is bigger than ant    
Ant is bigger than sugar particle    
None of these objects or their sizes     
exists in our mind    
Still we can compare    
Retina of eye convert light signals to electric signals    
Brain processes electric signals    
Processing of these signals is chemical process    
Process is same for all human being    
But even after that     
we all understand the world in different way    
It is Maya.    
    
We see around thousands of broken heart    
Thousands of broken marriage    
Thousands of cheating and deceiving around.    
But we still want get married, still have friends, relations    
This is Maya.    
    
We have not seen our great grandparents    
We know we have come from those human    
We know they have disappeared    
We know we will also disappear at one moment    
But we still behave like we are permanent here.    
    
We know great Kings of earlier time had huge wealth,     
empire, power, Large families, buildings etc.    
Today we don't see those kings around    
Probably their great grandchildren are begging on the roads.    
But we still want to work and earn like     
Our earnings can make our children and great grandchildren safe.     
This is Maya.     
    
We buy insurance, pension, large houses    
Big cars, beautiful foreign destination     
to buy comfort and hope happiness will come,    
Security will come.     
We know many are suffering even after having all these    
But we still want to have more.     
This is maya.     
    
Couple see many parents are abundant by their children     
Many children have been suffering since childhood.     
Many accidents and tragedies bring pain for the whole family.     
Many mistreat their parents.     
Abuse their property and compromise values and positions.     
But we still see happiness in having children     
This is maya.     
    
We have taken birth.     
Grown up and matured enough.     
If we understand the maya clearly.     
Then there is nothing to do.     
There is no goal, no work, even basic earning for survival looks meaningless     
It looks like there is nothing else to do in the world.     
    
Now, when we are just sitting idle without any work,    
we feel let's go and play    
In the process of play we get entangled in the game.     
We got to the extent that we want to own the playground and other players.     
We want to determine the rules of the game in the playground.     
This is maya.     
    
One day when we are kicked out of the playground     
Then we realize, play was real our attitude towards     
the playing caused us all pain, suffering and miseries.     
    
O Chaitanya, play well    
Ready to drop whatever you acquired through your hard play.    
Your giving, taking, producing all are happening in Maya.    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Yours Truly Hari
