# Job Satisfaction
## About Enjoyment    
   
Life is a process and in life we do processes     
Something is given to us as an input     
We do some actions on the given input     
And we produce some output     
Input is never 100% in our control. But, the quantity and quality of the benefits     
depends upon how the output of a process     
is perceived by the receiver.    
    
The output of a process and     
Benefits of the output of the process     
are two completely different things    
    
Even though input is not in your control     
It is expected that you control the output     
By your will, skills, and hard work     
You can try and influence that to a great extent.    
    
But, the benefits are are not that straight forward     
Benefits are always about perceptions.    
    
Managing output of a process     
where you have control may be easier.     
But managing perception is never easy.    
    
No matter what is the quality of output     
If a receiver has a negative impression     
about you, your team, your company, and your product     
then it may be futile to try to convince.    
    
If blocker in the receiver     
is knowledge then you can try.     
But, if the blocker is as subtle as ideology,     
philosophy, blind faith, eroded trust     
then how do you convince     
the benefits of the output of your work?    
    
If we live a conscious life then     
input for our actions can be filtered and purified.     
Actions can be improved     
and output can be most probable as desired.    
    
But, even with the highest consciousness     
and the best output you may not     
deliver the benefits as expected.    
    
If we want to control the uncontrollable (benefits)     
And let go of the controllable (actions) in your life     
Then life is going to be full of boredom,     
rejection, loneliness, tiredness, and frustrations.    
    
And all this lead to a search     
for other means of enjoyments     
That is why for most Friday is beautiful     
and Monday is stressful.    
    
Reflection on benefits and output of our actions     
helps us improving our actions     
it also helps improving input criteria     
But how to do it if all the time focus is fear of failure?    
    
It is easy to say keep eye on the goal and work hard     
But practicality if all the time you remain     
obsessed about goal and benefits to others     
You will miss life, you miss the process,     
you miss the game, and finally     
you may miss the output and benefits.    
    
Whether in life or in business     
If I know what is the purpose of business     
what is the purpose of my role     
What I am supposed to do,     
Then acquired the right skills to do the work at hand     
Then why should I keep the goal always in my head all the time?     
Cannot I do it playfully?    
    
No matter how much trained we are     
If we are always on high alert     
If we are always working under the cloud of fear of failure     
We are going to get broke very soon     
With all money in our bank     
Is this what we want to earn     
at the end of the month or year?    
    
Just think about who is happier     
A musician who is playing to make the audience happy     
or a musician who is playing to enjoy his best    
    
A sportsman who want to ensure that his team should win     
or a sportsman who is playing his best.    
    
A project manager who wants to get     
five-star rating from his customer     
or a manager who does his best to deliver what is needed.    
    
A person who prepares food to demonstrate his culinary skills     
or a person who is putting his best to make nutritious food.    
    
A soldier who is fighting his enemy to demonstrate his bravery     
or a person who is ready to die in the war and     
never bother what happens after his death.    
    
Whether you are a manager or musician,     
artists or scientist, employee or employer,     
daily wage worker or contractor,     
soldier or a farmer     
If you always focus on the benefit     
then stress is part of your life     
To create happiness for other     
and make money for your family     
do not earn miseries for yourself.    
    
Whether it is reading or walking,     
Doing accounting work or managerial work     
Doing research or creating a piece of art     
Sooner or later we need to learn,     
how to keep money, recognition, otherâ€™s happiness aside    
    
Sooner we need to learn     
how to enter into the game of life     
Acquire all the skills to play the game,     
improve our skills every day     
And play our game in the best way     
If we enjoy a game the best     
Then it matters least what happens to the output of the game     
It matters least who is happy with you or who not     
It matters least how to manage perceptions.    
    
Ask yourself, you are working because you are happy     
Or you are working for happiness?    
    
O Pratibimba! Is it so difficult to understand?     
or Cosmos has written some other fate of human?
