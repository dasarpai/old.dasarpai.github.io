# Gate Of Mind
    
I am a prisoner of the mind     
Nobody forced me here     
I came here by accident     
I don’t know through which what gate I came inside     
Because today I don’t see any gate here     
When I came here I was a small child     
Absolutely nothing and negligible in the world.     
That is how I could have entered here     
playfully through any smallest possible window.    
    
Today I have become so big     
I am big in body, big in money, intellect,     
power, relationships, and all my possessions.     
I want to come out of this mind but I am not able to come.     
How can I come out of my mind when I am so big?     
The mind is a prison without any door.     
Only one very small window through     
which some light of life come inside.     
That is why I am living.     
I know I am living in my mind.     
I know I am not living in life.     
I am not living in the existential reality.     
The reality in which I live in is the creation of my mind.    
    
If I want freedom from this prison then the only hope is     
I should drop all my I-ness and my-ness     
Following this method, I will become     
the lightest and smallest possible     
And then I can run away from that small window     
from which light of life is coming in     
For that, I need to become as light as light     
As untainted as light.    
    
I can fly in that open sky,     
The sky without any boundary.     
I am boundless and the sky can live together.     
Because we both are boundless.     
That infinite sky is my home     
and eternal companion,     
because in real sense I am a life     
Which is captured in mind.     
My mind is like a hall of solid walls     
without the Gate of Mind.    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Yours Truly Hari
