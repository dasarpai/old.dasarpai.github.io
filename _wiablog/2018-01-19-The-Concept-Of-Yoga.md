# The Concept Of Yoga
    
Cleaning and alignment of a person     
at the physical, emotional, intellectual, and energy     
to the surrounding and cosmos in large     
is utmost important for happy living     
and well being of an individual.    
    
For that purpose, we do various kinds of activities     
like bathing, prayers, social work, preaching, study, etc.     
But ultimately it is for the self only.    
    
How foolish it is to think that     
I am bathing so that others do not smell bad in me,     
I am doing social service for the sake of society,     
I am doing prayer for the sake of God and the well-being of others,     
I am doing a study to make my student successful.    
    
We should be thankful for the cosmos     
that it has given me so many     
opportunities and methods to clean ourselves.    
    
These different methods are called     
Gyan yoga, Bhakti yoga, Karma yoga, Ashtanga yoga etc.     
Depending on the level you are cleaning yourself.    
    
But the ignorant mind will always be convinced that     
I am doing so much for my children, society,     
company, family, nation and     
they cannot pay me back for my hard work and austerity.    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Yours Truly Hari
