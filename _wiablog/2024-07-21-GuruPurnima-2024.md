# Happy Guru Purnima   
   
There are two kinds of Vidya.    
Through one, we know the world and make our livelihood,    
build relationships with others,    
and improve our job, business, and relationships.    
Those who help us navigate this outer world    
we call Shikshak, teacher, or Acharya.    
For them, we celebrate Teacher's Day.   
   
There is another Vidya through    
which we connect to the self.    
This is a lonely journey.    
There is no "we" or "you" in that journey.    
I am alone.    
I go inside, introspect, and ask myself:    
Who am I?    
From where do I come?    
Where do I stand? Where am I going?    
What do I want to do in my life?    
What do I want to achieve in my life?    
How important is that really for me?    
The one who helps us travel in this inner world is Guru.    
Today is the day to thank that one.    
Thanks to Ved Vyasa for his great work,    
due to which we celebrate this day.    
Thanks to Buddha, who gave his first sermon    
today in Sarnath to those interested in this inner journey. 
   
Hari Om Tat Sat   
Yours Truly Hari
