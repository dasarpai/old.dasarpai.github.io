# An Example Of Web Of Problems  
    
Whatever can wrong, will go wrong. Today I wanted to file my Annual GST return and this is what happened to me. I don’t know whether this much ever happened to any of you!    
    
1\. Wanted to file my GST Annual Return (10 am) -&gt;     
2\. Need to pull Billing Details from Excel File -&gt;     
3\. Excel License Expired today -&gt;     
4\. Wanted to Renew License but for payment this time I wanted GST Bill with my GST details-&gt;     
5\. No option of entering my GST number on Microsoft website-&gt;     
6\. Did research, no outcome -&gt;     
7\. Call Microsoft, Pathetic Help -&gt;     
8\. Finally Come to Know for Home Edition GST Bill not available -&gt;     
9\. In the meantime found since last 3 years MS every year increasing cost of this software around 1000/year (INR 4200 to 5200 to 6300 this year) so to reduce the cost by adjusting GST I Wanted to Purchase Software through Business Account-&gt;     
10\. Went on Microsoft site to create office license under my company name (I have a google private domain name for that)-&gt;     
11\. It asked me to enter TXT or MX record in the domain to prove that I am the owner of the site-&gt;     
12\. Existing domain is a private domain so TXT or MX records cannot be updated -&gt;     
13\. Existing pmohead@drrxxx.in is customer’s account so no use for me as of today -&gt;     
14\. Tried my another domain, but encountered a problem that emails are bouncing from there-&gt;     
15\. Researched and come to know that it is because of Cloudflare -&gt;     
16\. Figured out how Cloudflare works and why I installed this-&gt;     
17\. Now, to make email working I called the hosting company of this domain-&gt;     
18\. They told me to make MX or TXT record entry in Cloudflare DNS and use that Cloudflare provided DNS-&gt;     
19\. Figured out where DNS entry should be made (it should be done at domain provider’s site), in my case my domain is taken from godaddy so on godaddy site -&gt;     
20\. By default GoDaddy has its own DNS entry corresponding to my domain -&gt;     
21\. My content is hosted on Hostgator therefore I should enter HostGator DNS on GoDaddy site (it was learning for me) -&gt;     
22\. If I want Cloudflare should work then DNS records provided by Cloudflare should be entered -&gt;     
23\. I tried, now emails are not bouncing but not getting delivered as well -&gt;     
24\. I research this issue further and come to know that this is a common problem that Cloudflare and email compatibility issue exist and lot of struggle to make it work -&gt;     
25\. Disabled my Cloudflare services for my domain on Cloudflare site -&gt;     
26\. Made GoDaddy DNS entry as default -&gt;     
27\. Now my website site stopped working-&gt;     
28\. Come to know that changes will be effective in 24-48 hours, so wait-&gt;     
29\. But then realized that DNS entry should be of Hostgator because that is the place where content is hosted -&gt;     
30\. So changed the DNS on hostgator, now domain is working -&gt;     
31\. Still I don’t have any new domain which I can use to purchase Microsoft 365 office business license-&gt;     
32\. Used my third domain RXXX-&gt;     
33\. Earlier I was not using this because I didn’t want to confuse my licensing with too many unrelated domains but now I have no solution -&gt;     
34\. Created new Microsoft office 365 account with RXXX domain-&gt;     
35\. Now wanted to purchase the license but now it says the cost of the business license itself equal to the cost which I was paying for Office 365 Home Edition + GST. And GST is extra. so the whole exercise is futile-&gt;     
36\. Started looking for an alternative of office 365 -&gt; Found libre 6.2.4 &amp; Polaris Office 2017 -&gt;     
37\. Download and tried but only Polaris is a little bit near to Office 365 -&gt;     
38\. Finally took the decision this year I will not use Office 365 and manage with Polaris, free license, or if required professional license. If this does not serve my purpose and a need arises during my data science work then only I will purchase-&gt;     
39\. Finally open GST billing data in Polaris software    
    
The whole 12 hours went to into drain and at 10 pm, I am proceeding for GST Annual Finally    
    
I am sure many of you have burned someday of your life like this. Don’t worry you are not alone.
