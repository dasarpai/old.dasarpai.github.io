# Paapam and Punyam in Awareness   
    
A person is in comma or deep sleep and     
something horrible related to him     
happens around him and he is unaware.     
He comes to know about this when he     
come out of coma or deep sleep.     
His deep sleep or comma may break     
after 8 hours or after 24 days.    
What happened to him during his sleep was because of his Paapam or Punyam?    
    
A person is in comma or deep sleep and     
something most wonderful related to him     
happens around him and he is unaware.     
He comes to know about this when he     
comes out of coma or deep sleep.     
His deep sleep or comma may break     
after 8 hours or after 24 days.    
What happened to him during his sleep was because of his Paapam or Punyam?    
    
When you are in the state of unawareness     
then Paap or Punya is meaningless.    
When you are aware     
then only Paapam or Punyam has meaning.    
    
But if you are fully aware     
then how will you respond     
to these events of so called Paapam or Punyam?    
By the response of crying, laughing, abusing, praising?    
Or Just being a witness of the event.    
    
Most of the humanity react     
to circumstances and situations in a half sleeping, half waking state.    
They don't even know what pure awareness is.
