# Life In Awareness
    
When you are in a deep sleep     
There is no dream, no awareness     
of the inside, the mind, and body     
And no awareness of the outside world,     
the clothes you are wearing,     
the bed and place of your sleeping,     
the time of your sleep,     
persons, relatives friends, foes around you.    
    
At that time there is no experience of time and space     
No influence of forces of time and space upon you     
No misery, no pain, no gain, no loss,     
No love, no hate, no enemy, no friend     
Nothing is yours, nothing of others     
Non-duality in unawareness!    
    
But that time all these really cease to exist?     
No! they all exist but you are not aware.     
Do they exist the same way,     
the way they exist when you are awake?    
    
No! because your awareness     
influences everything around you.     
No! because you also create     
a lot many things in your mind.    
    
Consciousness is all-pervading in the space     
And beyond space     
In all the inert and live.    
    
Consciousness is spanning in all the time of     
past, present, and future     
And when there is no time    
    
For our senses, there is no place where is no space.     
But for our mind, there is an experience of no space.    
    
For our mind, there is no time when time is no more.     
But in our life, there is an experience of no time.    
    
How come we experience something     
Which doesn’t exist like no time and no space?    
    
Consciousness is not like air,     
because it also exists where no air     
not like darkness, because it also exists in no darkness     
not like light, because it also exists in no light     
not like goodness, because it also exists in no goodness    
    
Awareness is local and limited to the boundary     
When physically boundary is human     
then it is called is a human life     
When animal then it is an animal life     
When society then it is a social life     
When religion then it is a religious life     
When culture then it is a cultural life     
When nation then it is a life of a nation.    
    
Without awareness     
An animal is no animal.     
Human is no human.     
Society is no society     
Culture is no culture     
Religion is no religion     
A nation is no nation    
    
It looks like human or animal lives     
are the lowest form of self-aware entities     
And society, religion, culture, nation     
is the collective awareness of the living people, animals, etc     
All these are part of bigger systems.    
    
But think if your hand, stomach, legs, lungs,     
and heart are self-aware or not?     
If they are not self-aware then who makes them work?     
Don’t fool yourself by saying the wish of god!     
By that logic even society, nation everything is run by god!    
    
So, if all parts of my body are aware     
Then what is that smallest entity which is self-aware?     
Body cells? Molecules? Atom? Subatomic particles?    
    
Awareness in the gross body is percolated upside     
From the subsystems of which a body is made     
But consciousness is not like that.    
    
So what happens at sleep when you lose awareness?     
Do you have consciousness in the body?     
Of course, consciousness is full-on in all space and time.     
But awareness is dimmed     
Individual body parts are aware and they work     
because they have consciousness     
and dimmed self-awareness.    
    
But in the deep sleep state, the body as a whole     
even with the omnipresent consciousness     
doesn’t have awareness of the self.    
    
Awareness gets dimmed when you over eat     
You are drunk, lost in anger, lost in lust, and sleep.    
    
Awareness is the basis of life     
Your body parts may have     
consciousness and self-awareness so they may survive     
but if you lose awareness of your body parts     
then very soon you die even with self-aware body parts    
    
With awareness, we can make dying parts, live again     
Without awareness, we can make     
our perfect working system dead in a course of time    
    
Whether it is the body of an individual,     
or family, or culture or nation     
It is the awareness of those lives     
who are part of the system,     
that makes the system live.    
    
Physical Body or society or nation     
of unaware person, citizens are consumed by maggots.    
    
Chemical substances, drugs, selfishness     
are poisons of the system they reduce the awareness    
    
If you are in favor of life for your body,     
culture and nation then chose awareness    
    
But for that remain at a distance     
as much possible from toxins,     
mind-numbing substances, selfishness.    
    
Life is definitely not about forgetting past bad events     
for which we need to consume something to forget.    
    
Life is definitely not about mindlessly enjoying     
getting engrossed and losing control over the body     
for which we consume something.    
    
Life is about living in awareness,     
For that, we need to learn to handle our own mind     
And it is not by trying to forget something.     
or pretending to forget something.    
    
O Pratibimba, In the absence of awareness     
There may be consciousness but no life.    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Yours Truly Hari
