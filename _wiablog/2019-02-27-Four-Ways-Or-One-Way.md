# Four Ways Or One Way   
    
Generally, people think,     
Bhakti Yoga, Karma Yoga,     
Raj Yoga, Gyana Yoga     
are the four parallel paths in life,     
which leads to the same goal.     
Hence, they think to walk on any road,     
and we will reach the same place.    
    
If you like road analogy     
then know it as only one road,     
which you travel with four kinds of wealth.     
Every moment, every day, and phase of life     
based on the need you use     
different wealth and keep moving.    
    
Without Shraddha and Bhakti,     
you cannot commit yourself for travel.    
    
Without Karma Shakti,     
you cannot walk even a foot on this road.    
    
Without Raj Yoga, your body and mind     
will become weak during the journey and     
you can fall early in the journey.    
    
Without Gnyana Shakti     
you will not know, why to travel?     
where am I going? who is traveling?     
how long I should go?     
shall I stop and just watch the surrounding?     
what shall I do? What do I want to achieve?    
    
With Gnyana Shakti     
you know that this is not a journey of “me”     
because I am Sat-Chit-Anand.     
Omnipresent, all through existing.    
    
There is nothing to know here     
but everything to experience     
whether I am here or there or nowhere.    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Yours Truly Hari
