## Happening Human Reasoning

    
Think about any ten unconnected things.     
Connect them all in a half-page story.     
Any human can do this.     
Children can do it better and faster.    
    
A small patch of white clouds in the sky,     
a crow in the nest, a snake crawling to cross the road,     
a man going to home in his cycle,     
the day is Saturday, time is inauspicious Rahukaal,     
man listening to a lovely old song from FM radio.     
What is the connection between all these?     
Who gave meaning to the time that it is good and bad?    
    
It shows immense imagination power of the mind,     
this kind of mind rests in the human.     
Scientists try to guess some number     
but no one truly knows how much memory a human mind has.     
No one knows the elastic limit of the human mind.     
Elasticity to imagine, dramatize and think.    
    
This capacity gives human an ability     
to create a reason for any happening.     
We debate, argue, and have an immense desire     
to win after convincing others.     
In fact, human consider that the greatest winning     
than other physical war and winning.    
    
Those contemporary minds     
which are able to convince others for something unthinkable     
and show them the path     
to come out of their current problems     
they are called the prophet, lord, son of god, gods, avatar, and leaders.    
    
People say everything happening around us     
because of some existing cause.     
If we are not able to establish a cause     
then some say it is by chance.     
But some others say if we are not able to find the reason     
then it means the reason is too complex and deeper.     
And nothing happens by chance.    
    
Every death has a cause.     
But there are some who suspect everything.     
They say the cause of death is murder.     
And the cause of the murder is something else     
and reasoning keep going endlessly.     
One day they can prove also that     
death is not natural but a murder.     
After all who knows the fact?     
Even a person may have died without knowing!    
    
The “murder” is equivalent to “cause”.     
They try to reason out everything.     
Why human looks so helpless     
when s/he feel something happened     
but the cause is beyond the apprehension     
of any living intelligent being?    
    
Human reasoning is fine     
because it’s part of human design     
but can’t things simply happen without any reason?    
    
Some human are so convinced that     
even leaf fall from the tree because of God’s wish or     
wind’s force, or gravity etc.     
Cannot human come to term with nature and     
surrounding and say it happened because the time has come.    
    
When the time comes to happen something     
It will happen and people can build the reasons     
to convince himself or others.     
Can’t we agree that time is the only reason     
and all other reasons are the creation of human intellect?    
    
We find joy in reasoning.     
But, does reason really matters and important in nature?     
The human mind will always say yes.     
That is why he is able to discover     
so many mysteries of nature,     
travel in space, go to mars and the moon.     
Create laws, rules, systems, and processes     
to manage the surrounding in a better and predictable way.    
    
But there is something in existence     
that fails every human reasoning.     
When that power wants it will happen     
and human is like a helpless small insect     
in front of that unseen, unseeable but humongous power    
    
You can call it whatever you want.     
You can attach whatever shape,     
color, personality, emotions     
you want to attach this.    
    
But, think and reason it out     
how can you influence this mammoth     
one power of the whole existence?    
    
Your morality, meditation, prayer,     
community work, social service     
All is either for yourself, your family,     
your society or your nation.    
    
That power, which governs the existence     
is not even aware of that     
in this infinitely vast cosmos     
Some kind of insect calls himself human     
in some part of this multiverse looking for my favor!
