## The Nature Of Karma Fala   
    
Fruits may be sweet or bitter, rotten, ripe, or raw.     
These are the attributes attached to a fruit.     
You cannot take these attributes away from the fruit.     
Like heat cannot be taken away from the fire.    
    
Good or bad are not attributes of a fruit     
like the heat is an attribute of the fire.     
Every fruit has some essence     
and fruit cannot exist if you remove all those the essence.    
    
Essense of the sweetness of the fruit is inside the fruit     
but goodness is not inside the fruit.     
Because goodness is not the essence of the fruit.    
    
Good or bad is not an attribute of the fruit.     
This classification of good and bad     
of fruit resides in the human mind.    
    
If you get what you want     
at the time when you want     
then you label it good     
otherwise, you call that bad.    
    
When you were a child and like mango fruit     
then what sow is a mango seed.     
But by the time seed becomes a tree     
and gives the fruit of your karma     
you become sick and cannot eat mango     
Now you cannot say that     
the fruit of my karma (mango) is not good.    
    
Now if you need Neem leaf     
or neem fruit for the cure then     
it is not available because you have not sown that.    
    
Because Neem is going to cure you     
and someone gives you Neem     
It doesn’t neem is good now.     
You are labeling it good.    
    
In life, we cannot live without Karma     
At every moment of life, we do some     
mental or physical or vocal karma.     
Some of those Karma bear the fruits immediately,     
like feeling the heat when you go near to the fire.    
    
Some of the Karma bear fruit after one year,     
like studying for the annual exam.     
Some of the Karma bears fruit after 2 months,     
Like your prepare for a job interview.     
Some of the Karma bears fruit at an unknown time     
Like you think ill or good about somebody     
And you go through mental trouble at another time.    
    
The principle of Karma Fala is too intrigued.     
You don’t know in what format     
it will come back when.     
No matter how much consciously you work     
In life many times you have to chew     
that fruit which you don’t want at that time.     
If you like it you call it good     
If you don’t like it then you name it bad.    
    
But there is nothing absolute bad Fala or good Fala     
Good and bad depends on what you get     
in what situation and time.    
    
O Pratibimba, do you still think     
there is good Karam and bad Karma?     
Do you still think there is     
Good Karama Fala and Bad Karma Fala?     
Do you still think Good Karma leads to Swarga     
and Bad Karma Leads to Narka?    
    
Good, Bad, Swarga, Narga is your own state of mind     
Where is the duality for that     
who has transcended this Duality?     
But is it that easy to experience that non-duality?    
    
And because we cannot experience that non-duality     
which really exists it doesn’t mean that     
we create something out of our own imagination!
