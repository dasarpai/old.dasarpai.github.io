# All Religions are not Same  
   
## Introduction   
  
Long ago, when I completed the study of Prasthantrai (comprising the ten cardinal Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, and Brahma Sutra), it opened my eyes to world religions and diverse philosophical concepts. I delved into it under the Advaita Vedanta school of Philosophy (Darshana), and it took a significant amount of time to align with the ideas presented in Advaita Vedanta. Contemplating on this, I felt the urge to write and reflect upon my thoughts. In the meantime, I explored other world religions, delving into their histories and geographies where they rise and grown. Based on my understanding, I compiled the following tables to illustrate the unique characteristics of each religion. It became evident to me that all religions are distinct. In this article I am emphasizing the need to comprehend the various parameters and belief systems of each religion. I hope this will help all people including religious, secular and atheist. To facilitate comparison and avoid confusion, I've outlined the major belief systems of the five main religions/faith/systems.
