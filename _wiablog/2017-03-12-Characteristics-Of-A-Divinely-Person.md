# Characteristics Of A Divinely Person
## Assets of Divinely Person    
       
Many people get confused about what is good and whatnot,     
what is right and whatnot.     
Obviously, it is the context that makes things     
good or bad, right or wrong     
but there is small help from the Guru of Bhagwat Gita     
for those who are looking for commandments.    
    
Unfortunately, many people around us do not know Samskrut     
and in local Indian languages, these Samskrut words have various meanings.     
Although the commentary of many Acharya’s     
has been translated into English     
but those are so big to read     
that people think we will read and understand that after retirement.     
Other times commentary from different     
Bhakti, Vishista Advaita Vedanta, Advaita Vedanta     
Schools have multiple interpretations.    
    
The text below is translated based on my understanding     
of Samskrut and understanding various translations of Bhagawat Gita.
