# What Is CSR
## About Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)     
        
Corporate Social Responsibility is a concept    
Where a corporate should own the responsibility of society.    
They should not simply make a profit, share the profit    
among the employees, investors & other stakeholders.    
But should consider society around    
as an integral part of their existence to survive.    
But why should any corporate do this CSR program?    
Because they are large fish in the pond    
therefore they should show compassion to the others    
and hence do not eat all the fishes of pond together    
otherwise, they themselves will in danger?    
Because society has given the platform to perform    
therefore they should reciprocate?    
Because they should comply with government regulations?    
Because they will get more name and fame    
as a compassionate organization    
and they can capitalize on that power to grow further    
and cover up their wrongs of past, present, and future?    
Any sensible person need to understand    
no one can exist longer in isolation,    
so it is about the entire ecosystem.    
In an ecosystem every individual    
no matter how small they are    
they play some significant role.    
If you try to manipulate the system    
and alter some element of the ecosystem    
then there are consequences of it.    
By doing so either you change    
the rules of the game unilaterally, which is unfair    
or the entire system comes to danger because of your actions.    
    
In an ecosystem, no matter how small    
or insignificant is a microbe    
do not kill it, it has its own utility.    
    
When a factory makes some product,    
it uses natural resources and pollutes the natural resources    
Which was right of the local citizens of that area    
Therefore, it is the responsibility of the corporate    
to share the profit with the local citizens.    
But, how to share?    
Going around distributing money does not make sense.    
So they put equipment,    
which measure the pollution    
which controls the pollution    
which ensure minimum usage of the local resources    
But that is their primary responsibility,    
that is the way should do business    
It is not a CSR!    
When they reach the local society    
help them improve their life around    
by hiring local people for jobs, planting a tree,    
sponsoring education, health, food expense of the poor around    
Developing roads, park, community hall    
These are all part of the responsibilities of a corporate.    
In Indian ancient wisdom traditions    
It is mentioned that    
There are four purposes of human life    
Work for Dharma, Work for earning money,    
Work for Enjoyment, Work for Moksha.    
And they go only in this sequence    
without changing the order.    
Dharma is the Duty, Responsibility of the individual    
towards others in the surrounding.    
When you exist you share many relationships    
with many people and entities around    
There is nothing unconnected and unrelated in the existence.    
And that relationship obliges you to perform    
your responsibility towards them    
It is not about your large-heartedness,    
compassion, pity, or generosity.    
It is just because it is your Dharma,    
it is your responsibility.    
Nobody should teach you,    
neither you should feel that    
you are doing something great.    
You must know this is    
my Dharma, Duty, Responsibility.    
This concept of Dharma applies    
to all power centers and lives    
You as an individual have Dharma    
You as an organization has Dharma    
You as an institution has Dharma    
The state has its Dharma towards citizen and all others living around    
Rastra has its Dharma towards the citizen.    
In Dharma, there is eternally going Yagnya.    
Yagnya is possible only when all the stakeholders participate    
If any of the stakeholders do not participate    
or participate half-heartedly    
then very soon Yagnya will come    
to halt and subsequently to the end.    
CSR is a gesture of gratitude of an organization    
towards the surrounding.    
It is a kind of Yagnya,    
It is part of their core business    
It literally says thank you so much    
You gave us an opportunity to exist, survive and thrive    
Therefore as long as I am living around    
I will do my best possible for the surrounding.    
And by doing so,    
I am indirectly supporting my own survival.    
Ideally, CSR activities should be done    
in the area and with the surrounding society.    
A location where an organization physically exists,    
produces, serves, and consumes.    
This is not fair you earn from X locality, district, state, or country,    
and being multinational perform or sponsor CSR activities    
in Y locality, district, state, or country.    
If that is the case then    
why X should allow you to exist at their place?    
Simply because you have the protection of the law!    
In todayâ€™s time, we find there are super-rich organizations    
Who have earned a lot from society    
Either by doing business in the right way or    
smart way or deceitful way or by leveraging technology    
    
Some of there organizations feel a sense of gratitude    
and they give some portion of their profit to the CSR program    
And media reports it as their big-heartedness    
Obviously, it is their big heart    
Otherwise generally with huge money    
heart of the people shrink for others or it becomes stone.    
There are many super-rich people around who give money    
But for a specific community and specific purpose    
They want to make sure that even in the CSR    
their own agenda should remain on top    
They give money to NGO for conversion,    
lobbying against the certain rule,    
lobbying against the government,    
to register protest against their opponent,    
get played in the hand of the enemy    
and do more harm to society    
than serving society    
and expressing gratitude.    
CSR is not about the activities of those    
who are making a profit    
CSR is not only about the engagement of big companies    
CSR is not brand building    
CSR is not about giving adventure opportunities to your employees    
CSR is not about a scheme to make your employees happy    
    
No matter what happens    
CSR is your responsibility to express gratitude    
Towards those who have given you shelter    
After becoming rich it is easy to say    
I pay taxes to a government    
I do business in an ethical way    
I am keeping my employees and partners happy    
I have money I can go anywhere    
Why should I spend my money on these    
beggars and poor around    
But this is not humanity!    
    
To be happy, survive, and thrive    
an organization need to spend upon their employees    
So, do not be short-sighted and small-hearted    
and limit your family only to those    
who is reporting to you on daily basis?    
Spend time with the society around    
Teach them, plant the tree for them,    
Conserve water with them,    
Conserve electricity with them,    
Celebrate festivals with them    
    
As per the government rule    
CSR funding by an organization    
should be done as some percentage of their profit.    
But, even when you are not able to make the profit    
Go out and express a sense of gratitude    
for the ecosystem around.    
    
When your employees go out and you pay them    
It is your CSR,    
But, when your employees take leave and go out    
It is your investment in developing wonderful human being    
This is how the spirit of CSR should be.    
Oh, wise reader, what do you think is true CSR?
