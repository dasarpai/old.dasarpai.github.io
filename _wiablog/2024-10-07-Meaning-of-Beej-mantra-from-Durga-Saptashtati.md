# Meaning of Beej Mantra from Durga Saptashati

In Hindu traditions, when the omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent power is worshipped as the Divine Feminine, we use different **Beeja Mantras** for **Jap** (chanting) and invocation purposes.

## What is a Mantra?

A "Mantra" is a syllable or verse that you repeat mentally or verbally to seek support from cosmic power. Before you start repeating it, you need to set an intention. Why are you repeating this mantra? What do you want to achieve? Depending on the situation and need, people repeat mantras for various reasons. Some seek health, others want wealth, success, children, jobs, or business growth. Sometimes, the sole intention is **Satsangati** (the desire to be in the presence of the Divine), where simply being in communion with the Divine is the only wish.

In the modern corporate, business, or political world, we also hear different types of mantras from various authors, business gurus, and trainers. They ask you to repeat or remind yourself of a formula for success. Through repetition, these also become mantras. However, in these contexts, you are the only person driving the effort. There is no intention to seek divine or higher support. You do the right work (as per the mantra), keep repeating it for a long period, and results are expected to follow (as per the assumption).

## What is a Beeja Mantra?

In Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist scriptures, a **Beeja Mantra** is generally a one-syllable word, representing a specific aspect of life. Based on your need, you chant the associated Beeja Mantra, and the corresponding Devi or Devata (goddess or god) responds to your invocation. To experience the true effects of a Beeja Mantra:
- You must have faith that mantras are powerful and effective.
- You need to practice the mantra for a long period.
- You must pronounce it correctly.
- You should repeat the mantra that aligns with your **Sankalpa** (intention or vow); otherwise, you may waste time.

## Why Are There So Many Beeja Mantras?

Human life is incredibly complex, and with each passing day, it becomes more so. This complexity is due to our exposure to our surroundings, technology, our ability to manage what we have acquired, and our desires for comfort. As a result, we need different resources. Some may seek health improvement, others may desire more wealth, power, love, better relationships, travel, enjoyment, fame, land, or business growth—the list is endless. Hence, different Beeja Mantras represent different aspects of your needs.

## Can Someone Do Mantra Japa for Me?

People often believe that if a Pandit (priest), Pujari, parent, friend, or child does the Japa (chanting) on their behalf, it will help them. To a small extent, this can be beneficial, especially when someone is going through a difficult period—whether related to health, money, or relationships. In such situations, prayers and Japa by others can offer some relief, especially when the person in need has lost the ability to focus on the practice themselves.

However, to achieve serious results from Mantra Japa, you must dedicate your own life energy to it. This is not something that can be outsourced like a BPO process. You cannot continue with your usual busy life while expecting someone else to do the spiritual work for you. The cosmic forces do not care about your wealth, power, or resources. The process is personal and works directly with your energy. If you truly care about invoking cosmic power, you need to set aside time and breath for this practice.

## What is the Meaning of Om in Every Mantra?

**Om** is the syllable that represents **Brahman** (not to be confused with Brahma, the creator). When the unmanifested becomes manifest, it first emerges in the form of the sound "Om." From this sound, everything else—various gods, worlds (lokas), protectors of the worlds (lokpals), animals, trees, and plants—comes into being. Thus, "Om" is **Ishwara**, the ultimate Divine in Sanatana Dharma.

Even Hindus who do not follow any particular sect (Vaishnava, Shaiva, or Shakta) and do not believe in a specific personal god still recognize **Om** as the ultimate, the first manifested reality.

## What are different Beej Mantra and what is the meaning of those?
