# Desire Renunciation And A Limited Self   
    
We know without desire living is not possible.     
It amazes me the way     
the concept of desirelessness     
has been taught and understood in our society.    
    
We know a desire and dreams     
helps human moving in his life     
With desire human eat, drink and walk,     
With desire human talk, dance and sing,     
With desire human search, paint, and construct.     
With the desire, we want to live and die!    
    
If everything happens with desire     
then how can we say     
a desire is not good hence be desireless?    
    
How can we say desirelessness is     
the highest state of existence?     
It is a state of Rushiness!    
    
We exist in a society,     
and we have relations     
with the people around us.     
Relations which carry their names.    
    
The name may be a friend, parents, son     
sister, brother, neighbor, citizen     
native, member, acquainted, or even unknown.    
    
Each named relation has its own Dharma     
And we interact with people around     
in the guidance of that dharma     
Dharma has attached responsibilities and actions.    
    
If the desire is not at the root of all actions,     
Then how can we do our Dharma (actions)?     
How come a Dharma driven society     
is taught to be desireless?    
    
Perhaps the meaning of desire     
has been misunderstood and miscommunicated     
Perhaps they wanted to communicate that     
don’t desire anything for the self.     
And we as a society and an individual     
failed to understand     
the meaning of desirelessness.    
    
Ah! philosophy is fine,     
but how can a thinking person     
work tirelessly without bothering for the self?     
When we exist as a body,     
Our first dharma is towards our nearest,     
And our living body is nearest to us.    
    
How can we be Dharmi     
while ignoring our nearest,     
this body, and this mind?    
    
Your philosophies say with selfish desire     
a human becomes cruel.     
But is this a problem of desire or limited self?    
    
If all the time we are thinking     
about me and mine     
and this me and mine is so narrow     
that it never crosses two-three people     
around us and our own body,     
Then this narrow me and mine     
is the source of pain, problems, and conflicts.    
    
We do not suffer because of desire     
We suffer because of the narrow me and mine!    
    
Desire to live is a basic desire     
this is prevalent in all living beings     
that is why the fight and flight response is inbuilt in all lives.     
And this is the basis of human survival.     
In the absence of desire why to fight or why to flight?     
Be ready to die all the time!    
    
In human life, desires can be of any size and kind     
But we need to keep in mind that     
Before I desire something I need to understanding “I”     
And expand the living experience of “I”     
So that human does not suffer     
because of limited identity, a limited “I”.    
    
In that state of awareness whatever largest “I” you experience,     
Desire from that perspective,     
Larger your umbrella of awareness     
Lesser is the problem in your desire.    
    
Your larger experience can be     
I am a family of 5 people or     
Village of thousand people or     
City of million people or     
Religion of billion people or     
Nation of billions of people or     
Male or Female of half human population or     
Humanity of this earth or     
Living being of this planet or     
Brahmin, the ultimate being of cosmos.    
    
We are not animal of the forest     
who just bother about their bodily survival,     
their family or their race.     
A wise human can desire     
for co-existence, happy existence of all.     
But that is possible only when     
when I think about the survival of my unlimited “Self”     
And what is this unlimited “Self”?    
    
Your philosophies say (Vidhur Niti)     
For the sake of a family, one person can be renounced     
For the sake of a village, one family can be renounced     
For the sake of a Janapada, one village can be renounced     
For the sake of “Self”, one Janapada or Kingdom can be renounced.    
    
We need to introspect,     
What is that “Self” which motivates     
human to remain in motion and action?    
    
What is that self for which, sages say,     
human should not desire?    
    
What is that “Self” for which, Upanishad     
is recommending to leave the kingdom?    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Your Turely Hari
