# Driven By Humanity Or Morality
    
Fear, pain, reward, and punishment,     
either from government or authorities or God or Karma     
Is always the driving force for a human to be righteous.    
    
It is not out of the Duty or Dharma     
of the given time and space     
But something different     
which brings humans to their senses.    
    
There are enough people around us     
who either don’t understand     
these driving forces correctly     
or do not take even these     
rudimentary motivations seriously,     
So they chose to ignore.    
    
There are enough people around us who are     
Broken heart, ignored, bitter and remorse,     
because of their own karma,     
which came back to them in their lifetime.     
So it becomes a reminder for others to live sensibly.    
    
There are enough people around us     
Who has wronged everything and maximum around     
But even after that, they are living     
without any visible pain in their life.     
And, it becomes another kind of reminder for people around.    
    
After seeing the examples of     
arrogance getting beaten badly     
and sometimes nothing happens.     
People around think and choose what to do!     
What they chose, depends upon their conviction.     
Sensible people chose the path of goodness.    
    
But, their goodness is driven out of the fear     
And not because they think that     
this is the most sensible way of living     
no matter what other people say or do around     
or what happens to other people around.    
    
Now take the below instances one at a time     
And think why do we behave the way we do.    
    
Who taught us Good or Bad?     
What is the motivation?     
Is motivation a fear, pain,     
or human sensitivity and sensibility?    
    
How to behave with elders and younger?     
How to treat mother, father, and teacher?     
What is the importance of giving timely help to some needy?    
    
Why to help a friend?     
Why donate for a cause?     
Why respect the resources we have?     
Why respect food?     
Why take care of our health when the body is fit?    
    
Why fight for our values?     
Why fight for our nation?     
Why pay taxes to the government?     
Why learn seriously in school?    
    
Why not leave older people at old age home?     
Why not beat or exploit the weak?     
Why not kill others?     
Why not flutter with friends’ spouses?    
    
Why not beat children?     
Why not steal goods?     
Why not waste money on luxury?    
    
Do you think, if fear of karma,     
God, unknown, Saitan, next life pain,     
suffering in the future are taken care     
then human will behave like a saint?    
    
Fortunately, the human cerebral cortex is     
such complex and highly developed     
compare to other animals that     
if a human explores he can be divine.    
    
But unfortunately, people don’t have time     
To think beyond enjoyment, business, religion,     
commandments, ethics, and morality     
Most of the people are stuck in either of these one     
So they live like a higher version of creatures    
    
No sense of Swa-Dharma,     
which every sensible person will always feel,     
irrespective of time and space.     
But, all the time body, recognition, money,     
the reputation of the self is the highest priority.    
    
So we take care of parents or     
do any of the above discussed good actions     
Because our children, next generation     
can repeat our actions for us     
Or God will punish us     
Or what other people will think about us.    
    
It is not about that,     
this is the only way of life     
Irrespective of who says or     
does what, now or in the future.    
    
That is why ancient people created those     
Fearful stories of hell     
and luxurious of heaven.    
    
Nowadays fortunately or unfortunately     
Those hell and heavens are falling     
So, God is taken care of.    
    
People started believing     
“Jindagi Naa Milegi Dobara”     
this is the only and last life.     
Rich people are learning     
how to manage government and courts     
Now, who will bring humans to their senses?    
    
O Pratibimba, Unfortunately, but true     
Why human is driven by Morality, not by Humanity?     
How can a bold and fearless human live without Humanity     
and take shelter under a tiny branch of Morality?    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Yours Truly Hari
