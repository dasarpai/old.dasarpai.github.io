# My Nonsenses is the Most Sensible - Poem

The world is madness, humans lost in haze,  
I stand alone, the saint in this maze.  
What I do is right, my path is clear,  
Your actions are senseless, driven by fear.

I smoke in my room, my space, my air,  
If the smoke bothers others, why should I care?  
My lungs, my money, my life to live,  
Who are you to take what I won’t give?

My pets may bark, hiss, or chirp with glee,  
They’re part of my world, they belong with me.  
If neighbors complain, let them stew,  
It’s my life, not theirs, I’ll do as I do.

When I party, when I drink, and dance with friends,  
If my neighbors frown, where does their freedom end?  
It’s my home, my joy, my voice raised high,  
Should I silence my laughter, my spirit, my sky?

My house overflows with treasures I adore,  
If others trip, or things break on the floor,  
It’s their blindness, not seeing the art,  
Their fault if they stumble, not mine to impart.

In my office, I’m the master or serve one,  
The clock’s pace is mine until the day is done.  
If you rush or wait, that’s on you,  
I hold the reins, your urgency won’t do.

In our temples, in our mosques, we proclaim,  
Our voices rise, free from shame.  
If you’re disturbed, find another place,  
For we practice our faith with power and grace.

My family, my blood, my ties that bind,  
What I do with them is solely mine.  
If screams echo or tears fall from house like rain,  
Who the hell you are to rein my my pleasure, my pain.

My shoes outside, with a scent so strong,  
If neighbors wince, they don’t belong.  
It’s my choice to clean them or leave them be,  
Their discomfort is no concern to me.

Only my way is the path that’s true,  
Only my road leads where the wise go through.  
No debate, no talk, I’ll silence your plea,  
For I hold the power, the truth, and the key.

O Chaitanya, this world spins wild and vast,  
If you watch without flinching, through all it casts,  
Then tell me, who’s the sane, and who’s the mad,  
In this world of chaos, where reason seems clad?
