# Greetings For New Year 2021   
    
## Happy New Year 2021
   
**How do you wish someone a happy new year?**  
This depends upon with whom we are talking.

There are people who mindlessly speak, walk, eat, and work.  
And there are people who are even  
aware of their every breath at every moment.

**What is meant by Happy New Year?**  
This also depends upon the person  
For some, it has great significant  
and for others, it is just another day of life.

Let me share **my happy new year wishes for friends.**  
As a Meditator, thinker, philosopher  
This is what I encourage you to think.

Earth moves on its axis and  
human observe this movement as  
Day and night, this is a cycle.

The moon rotates around earth and  
human observe full-moon day and no-moon day  
Human count the cycle and name it month  
This is also a cycle.

Earth rotates around the sun and human observe  
change of seasons this is another kind of cycle  
Human counts the cycles and name it as a year.

A women’s body has inbuilt cycles  
These cycles are aligned with the moon’s cycle.  
Our body is an extension of our mother’s body  
Hence our body is also cyclical.

Our sleeping, eating, working all are cyclical.  
Till the time these cycles are aligned  
To nature’s cycle, we are in good health  
The day we are out of sync,  
We have a physical or mental illness.

So human counts the cycle around  
and name it a day, month, year.

When something is cyclical then  
Can we say the cycle start at this time?  
Obviously not! For our convenience  
we say it starts at 12 am, or Monday or January

First January is important for humanity  
Because of interconnected economies and businesses  
Countries which has Economic power celebrates  
Their new year on the first of January, so others follow them.

Ideally speaking, if you consider yourself part of a free nation  
then your Independence day is your new year.  
if you believe in individual evolution  
then your birthday is the new year of your life.  
If you follow some religious or spiritual leader  
then his birthday is the new year of your life.

Whatever is the case  
This is the time to reset the cycle.  
To introspect, what I have done?, what I should do?  
What I was expecting and  
what environment around has given me?  
what have I learned?

When should we do this?  
Some people do it daily, some do it weekly,  
some monthly, some quarterly, some yearly  
and others when they get booted by life.  
There are many people who never do this  
nor understand the importance of this in life.

What we get from nature, government, friends,  
relatives is a matter of time.  
We only can ask or pray and nothing more than that.  
What we can do for these is 100% our choice.  
Let’s do our part in the new year.  
Let’s pray for friends.  
That they get the best physical and mental health.  
They have a compassionate mind and do the right things.  
They achieve their highest potential in the new year.

Until Next Time Remain   
  
Blessed Hari Om Tat Sat  
Yours Truly Hari
