# The Way To Learn
    
What is the food of a mind?     
No matter how good is the food     
you cannot eat it more than your stomach size     
Whether food is free or prepared,     
purchased or prasad from a temple     
There is a limit to food.     
After eating, we get settled for some time.    
    
But, what about the food for the mind?     
All the time mind is searching for food     
Never getting settled     
Sometimes get tired but that     
can be managed by context switching     
And changing topic     
those are different sources of getting mind food.    
    
What are we looking whole day     
either in books, TV, newspaper,     
phone, youtube, blogs or social media sites?     
You guessed it right. Food.    
    
Our mind is searching for food for himself     
Whole day variety of food for the mind     
Without giving any food,     
It is not easy to set your mind at rest    
    
Till we are awake either body     
is looking something through mind     
or the mind is looking for itself.    
    
But why mind is looking for food all the time?     
Does it want to know more?     
Does it want to Experience more?     
Or simply it is never trained     
to simply sit and watch the breath!    
    
A mind can search the whole day and get tired     
but still like it and     
then the next day go again.    
    
It is not that easy for mind to search in awareness and with breath     
Why? Because, there are high chances     
That normal mind will completely get lost     
In pure awareness of the self     
And normally mind is not ready to get lost.     
For him it is defeat!    
    
How mind explore, learn, and get absorbed?     
Focus on breath and you will learn about the body,     
Focus on dynamics inside stomach     
and know what is going inside.     
Look on the moon and mind explores the same     
And sometimes tearing a leaf or flower,     
Like a child in curiosity for what?     
Exploring, learning, and experiencing!    
    
Generally in the context of mind     
we say search inside or outside     
But the mind does not have that kind of boundary     
It is spread everywhere.     
For mind outside is inside, if it absorbed!     
And inside is outside,     
if it is able to inspire the surrounding.    
    
Learning in human life is the core process     
It gives us survival capability.     
Ability to choose between flight and fight     
But this is available to all creatures     
Through the learning of millions of years     
Our body cells have that infused knowledge.    
    
Using a mind for survival is too much overuse of the mind     
It is like using a heavy weapon to kill an insect     
For human, a mind opens the gate of realization.     
Something which cannot be directly sensed, perceived.    
    
A journey of learning starts in our life     
when parents guide us,     
we may learn or fail to learn there,     
then the teacher teaches us and we fail or pass in the class,     
Our friends and society teaches us continuously,     
From this, we may accomplish something or not is immaterial.     
What matters is we are learning and experiencing.    
    
Daily we observe lives around,     
without the help of any other being.     
We see some patterns and try to assimilate,     
the meaning of happenings.     
We may succeed or fail to assimilate that learning.     
But mind keep trying with one more step    
    
How do we know that we have learned?     
when we see contrary patterns     
Or we do something and     
the outcome is not as expected     
Then we learn that we have not learned enough     
Or we not learned correctly    
    
Learning is a life long process     
Therefore even if you learn wrong     
Or you make a mistake     
There is nothing wrong,     
In making mistake or doing wrong.     
But the condition is you should be self-aware     
An awareness which is free,     
From the guilt of mistake and fear of blame    
    
Ancient wisdom traditions say     
One-fourth of learning come from a teacher     
One forth from friends and society     
One forth come from experiments     
Final one forth come with time, passage of life.     
There is no shortcut for the fourth    
    
The source of learning is the question     
Not the borrowed question!     
But those which made you sleepless and restless    
    
Depth of learning doesn’t depend upon     
How much we have read     
But how much we could assimilate     
Assimilation of knowledge is not possible with borrowed questions    
    
The best teacher in life is a question     
If by the time children finish their education     
Teachers can teach them how to ask questions,     
Related to the subject of their interest     
Then we can say a college education is complete.    
    
A Master degree doesn’t mean I have become a master     
But it means by now I know     
that how Limited I know     
And this is the door opening for new life.    
    
Our teachers should tell us that     
An answer is that     
which settles some aspect of life.    
    
But no matter, How much you read     
It will not settle any aspect of your life.     
You need to move to next step.     
Reading and Listening conditions us.     
Is reading or listening bad?     
No, it helps us in asking questions     
But it happens to a seeking mind     
Asking those questions on which we can put our life     
And seek the answers on our own     
No copy and paste of guru, book, notebook, teacher or parents    
    
Why do we fail to ask the right questions?     
Because we are in a hurry of generalizing knowledge.     
This takes us away from the context     
And we fail to understand correctly.    
    
We need to understand generalisation     
in knowledge is a very heavy load process.     
We need to have huge experience and knowledge     
before we generalize the idea or concept.    
    
How should we ask questions?     
The way a child asks, with inquisitiveness,     
perseverance, trial, application     
And all on the self!    
    
If I learn anything in such a way     
that my wrong understanding can cause     
Serious loss to me or my dearest     
Then I will never fail to learn correctly.     
Thus, we should keep in mind that     
the right understanding is important.    
    
Why do we fail to learn correctly in class?     
Because we don’t know,     
The consequence of poor learning is     
A bad doctor, engineer, pilot, politician.    
    
Why do we fail to learn?     
Because of borrowed questions.     
Because of no relevance to the questioner’s life.     
Because of no context.     
Because of no application.    
    
So learning is important.     
But how to learn?
