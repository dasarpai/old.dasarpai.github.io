# Basics of Vedanta, Purana & Philosophical Schools   

In this article, I will discuss three main topics, primarily focusing on the introduction of Upanishads:
- What is Vedanta or Upanishads? Exploring the essence of Vedantic texts, their diversity, the extent of original work, and the existing material available today.
- Understanding Puranas or Upa-Puranas, their classification, and significance within Hindu literature.
- An exploration of different Darshan Schools or Philosophical Schools in Hinduism.

## Introduction to Upanishads 
The Upanishads (also called Vedanta), a collection of ancient texts within Hinduism, stand as a testament to profound philosophical inquiry. These texts, though shrouded in mystery regarding their exact count, are believed to correspond to each branch of the Vedas. With the Rig Veda boasting 21 branches, the Yajur Veda 109, the Sama Veda a staggering 1000, and the Atharva Veda 50, scholars estimate the existence of approximately 1180 Upanishads.

Originally, the Vedas were an extensive corpus without divisions, posing a challenge for their comprehensive study. To facilitate learning, the Vedas were organized into Sakhas, each containing a Samhita, Brahmana, Aranyaka, and Upanishad, and entrusted to different families for preservation through generations.

Despite misconceptions about the Upanishads being later additions, they are integral to the Vedic teachings, serving as their conclusive and paramount segment. Their philosophical depth transcends religious boundaries, offering universal wisdom that extends beyond the confines of Hinduism.

## Cardinal or Main Upanishads
Adi Sankaracharya, while preparing to write his commentary (Bhashyam) on the Brahma Sutras, sought substantial reference material. During this pursuit, he carefully selected ten Upanishads that possessed profound philosophical depth and relevance. These ten Upanishads proved to be exceptionally significant and comprehensive for his commentary on the Brahma Sutras. Consequently, these specific Upanishads earned the title of "cardinal" due to their pivotal role as foundational texts, serving as essential references in Adi Sankaracharya's interpretation of the Brahma Sutras.

1. **Ishavasya Upanishad**: It is a very succint summary of Indian philosophy that explains life itself.

1. **Kena Upanishad**: Kenopanishad derives its name from the word Kena, meaning 'by whom'. It belongs to the Talavakara Bahmana of Sama Veda and is therefore also referred to as Talavakara Upanishad. In short, it says that "The One power that illumines everything and every one is indivisible. It is the Ear behind the ears, Mind behind the mind, Speech behind speech, the Vital Life behind life. The ears cannot hear it; it is what makes the ears hear. The eyes cannot see it; it is what makes the eyes see. You cannot speak about it; it is what makes you speak. The mind cannot imagine it; it is what makes the mind think. It is different from what all we know; yet it is not known either. Those who feel they know Him, know Him not. Those who know that anything amenable to the senses is not Brahman, they know it best. When it is known as the innermost witness of all cognitions, whether sensation, perception or thought, then it is known. One who knows thus reaches immortality.

1. **Kathopanishad**: The Kathopanishad is divided into six Vallis. Valli literally means a creeper. A Valli, like a creeper, is attached to the Sakhas or Branches of the Veda. This Upanishad is also divided into two Adhyayas (chapters) of three Vallis each. This is one of the most beautiful Upanishads, in which the eternal truths are given in the form of a narrative. The narrative is taken from Taittiriya Brahmana (3-11-8), with some variations. The same story is told in the Taittiriya Brahmana, the only difference being that in the Brahmana, freedom from death and birth is obtained by a peculiar performance of a sacrifice, while in the Upanishad, it is obtained by knowledge only.

1. **Aitareya Upanishad**: The Aitareya Upanishad is one of the oldest of the Upanishads. It belongs to the Aitareya Aranyaka of the Rig Veda. It is divided into three chapters and contains thirty three verses. This Upanishad deals with the process of creation.

1. **Brihadaranyaka Upanishad**: Brihadaranyaka Upanishad means the "great forest-book". This Upanishad is one of the oldest of all the Upanishads. It consists of three sections or kandas: the Madhu kanda, the Yajnavalkya or the Muni kanda and the Khila kanda. Here the Brahman is portrayed as universal and undifferentiated consciousness. The doctrine of the indescribability of the absolute and the doctrine of 'Neti, Neti' are explained. This Upanishad concludes by stating the three virtues that one should practice, i.e. self-restraint, giving, and compassion.

1. **Prashna Upanishad**: In Sanskrit, Prashna means 'question'. This book consists of six questions and their answers, hence the name. It is in a question-answer format. Except the first and last questions, all other questions are actually a group of smaller sub-questions. As narrated in the beginning of this Upanishad, six pupils interested in knowing divinity or Brahman come to the sage Pippalada and ask questions of great spiritual importance. Pippalada asks them to take up a penance of one year. Upon completion of the penance, they again come to the sage and ask questions, and then the sage answers their questions.

1. **Mandukya Upanishad**: For the very reason that it explains the esoteric meaning of the fundamental syllable Aum of Hindu spiritual tradition, the Upanishad has been extolled greatly. The Muktikopanishad, which talks about all other Upanishads, says that if a person cannot afford to study all the hundred and more Upanishads, it will be enough to read just the Māndūkya Upanishad. According to Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, in this Upanishad, we find the fundamental approach to the attainment of reality by the road of introversion and ascent from the sensible and changing, through the mind which dreams, through the soul which thinks, to the divine within but above the soul.

1. **Taittireeya Upanishad**: The Taittireeya Upanishad belongs to the Taittireeya school of the Yajur Veda. It is divided into three sections called Vallis. The first is the Siksa Valli. Siksa is the first of the six Vedangas (limbs or auxiliaries of the Veda); it is the science of phonetics and pronunciation. The second is the Brahmananda Valli and the third is the Bhrugu Valli. These two deal with the knowledge of the Supreme Self, or 'paramatma-jnana'.

1. **Chandogya Upanishad**: Along with Brhadaranyaka Upanishad, the Chandogyopanishad is an ancient source of principal fundamentals for Vedanta philosophy. Considering the number of references made to this Upanishad in Brahma sutras, this Upanishad is given special importance in Vedanta philosophy. Important spiritual practices like Dahara Vidya and Shandilya Vidya are its speciality.


1. **Mundakopanishad**: This Upanishad begins with an Invocation that the eye may see auspicious things, the ear may hear auspicious sounds, and that life may be spent in the contemplation of the Lord. The teaching of this Upanishad is referred to as Brahmavidya, either because it describes first the message of Hiranyagarbha, the casual Brahma, or because the message relates the glory of Brahmam. This Upanishad speaks of Brahmavidya as the mystery which only those with shaven heads and those who go through a rite of having Fire on the shaven head can understand. So, it is called Mundaka, or shaven Head. Apart from this, this Upanishad is honoured as the crest of all, since it expounds the very essence of Brahma Jnana. It is assigned to the Fourth Veda, the Atharvana.

## **Remaining Upanishads**: 
The other 98 Upanishads are again classified according to their content as follows. They are General (of common interest), Saiva (dealing with Lord Shiva), Saktha (dealing with the divine mother Shakthi), Vaishnava (dealing with Lord Vishnu), Sanyasa (dealing with renunciation) and Yoga (dealing with Yogic practices) Upanishads.

## Conclusion:
The Upanishads, embedded within the Vedic tradition, epitomize the pinnacle of philosophical exploration. Far from being mere appendages, they form the essence of Vedic teachings, embodying the ultimate goal of spiritual understanding. While rituals and ceremonies found in the Samhitas and Brahmanas cater to the material welfare of society, the Upanishads and Aranyakas speak to seekers who have transcended mundane life, delving deep into philosophical truths.

These sacred texts, revered across cultures and religions, elucidate profound truths that traverse the boundaries of religious dogma. They symbolize the inclusivity of Hinduism, offering teachings tailored to diverse spiritual inclinations, from the worship of ancestors to the pursuit of profound nondual philosophy. The Upanishads remain a timeless repository of wisdom, inviting seekers to explore the essence of existence and the depths of universal truth.
