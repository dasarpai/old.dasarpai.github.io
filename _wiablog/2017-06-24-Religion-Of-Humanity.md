# Religion Of Humanity
    
We know for sure that birds, insects, reptiles & animals     
are the citizen of this planet.     
But, we do not know for sure that     
Human on this earth     
Came from another planet     
Or the evolution of animal on this planet     
Or God created humanity in his mind     
Every religion has its own cosmology.     
Biologists and theoretical physicists still debating the point.    
    
About human, one thing we know for sure     
That on this planet human came first     
Languages came and improved later     
Scripting of language came next     
And books came last    
    
From whatever process, the human came on this planet     
He first struggles to survive for a day     
Then for a longer and longer time.    
    
To ensure his own survival he produced children,     
communities, sciences for fighting     
and winning against nature and the animals around     
Finally, fight and win other communities around.    
    
The initial struggle was to arrange the external setup     
So that the external environment can be stabilized.     
To do that mass education was required     
The purpose was not to empower others     
The purpose was to make them understand     
what powerful muscular one wants.    
    
Immoral people cannot be dominated!     
For that purpose moral principles developed     
So that there is harmony within the society and ruling is easy.     
But at the time same those moral principles     
allowed to loot and murder other societies.     
And we regard human morality as God!    
    
Initially, the problem of the ruling was not that big     
Because initial desire was the desire to be stronger     
Then the desire to rule entered the human mind    
    
Over the period of time     
People started thinking about what is the purpose of life     
What is that which I should do     
for which people around me bow down before me.     
People worship me even when I am not around.    
    
Then some decided the purpose is to become     
the best in my community     
And all across the known world     
They worked hard to realized their purpose in life.    
    
Some came with the crazy ideas     
about the purpose of life     
which people around them couldn’t accept easily    
    
So the smarter one came with the ideas     
and said you have to listen to me     
Because God has sent me here    
    
To protect you, guide you, and teach you.    
    
God has given me some message for you     
You make the book of this message     
Read this message carefully     
Read 3 times or 5 times every day     
Don’t question The Book     
and Read with utmost faith.    
    
If you don’t understand     
then question your own intelligence and intellect     
Question your experience, senses, and common sense     
Question your limitations to reason but     
Never question this book     
This is a God-given book.     
Finally, if you don’t understand then     
ask me or my appointed people around.    
    
And, one more thing     
if you doubt this book     
then there is a hell, you will go there for eternal time     
But, if you believe in all of this book     
And do whatever is said then you will go to heaven.    
    
If people around you don’t understand     
and don’t follow the book     
Then do them a favor     
Kill them and send them to God     
All merciful god will give them love     
And when you go to God you will get special treatment.    
    
People in the olden time must be pained     
with their existing struggle too much     
Who wants to go to that hell     
which this so-called messenger of God is painting.    
    
On top of that world around     
must be full of struggle     
so even if there is a hope of getting a better place     
to live even after dying     
which this messenger is claiming,     
an eternal life with God and temporary pain on this planet     
Then let’s follow this wise and smarter person.     
Thus they followed the book.    
    
The initial purpose of creating religion was not that bad.     
It was a mass healing tool     
It was a tool to discipline people     
A tool to create a stable society     
A tool to create a knowledge base     
and transfer the knowledge to other people around     
and to the next generation.    
    
Without religion, it was not possible at all     
to come this far in human civilization as we have come today.    
    
Initially, Religion and power were integrated     
Slowly more independent thinker started coming     
challenging the book and the ruler     
These people were suppressed and out-casted     
When these independent thinkers made more sense to the masses     
then they have their own followers.    
    
When the new thinker dies     
his thinking and teaching becomes another book     
And his followers became religious.    
    
This business of reading, writing, and     
teaching is going on for many centuries.    
    
Those who cannot read     
someone else will read on their behalf     
Those who cannot write     
someone else write on their behalf.    
    
But, what happens if someone is not able to understand.     
Or understand something which is against     
the ruler and leader of the religion.     
In that case, a so-called learned will translate     
and make sure people understand     
what religious leader and ruler wants to say     
not what is written or what is good for the masses.    
    
Over a period of time so many other subjects     
has evolved for reading, writing, and teaching purpose     
A huge knowledge base is created around the new subjects.    
    
But old books remain always popular     
Not because they have teachings for human     
about how to live sensibly with other people around     
But because those are the tools of mass psychology,     
a tool to control and rule.    
    
Who, in power or religion,     
bothers truly about the life of the citizens?     
Everybody is interested either in their ruling or surviving.    
    
People go for the mass reading of their books     
They come and sit at one place     
Sometimes reading books in public places     
Sometimes reading with high volume speakers     
Not to prove that they are educated     
But to prove that they are faithful towards their religion.    
    
Read the same book, many times a day,     
every month, for years, read the same book     
Even for generations the same book    
    
If that much enthusiasm is there to read science,     
technology, politics, mathematics,     
environment, engineering, medical    
    
If people could graduate in those     
public reading classes from one level to another level.    
    
If people could show so much     
energy level for the group study of other subjects    
    
If people could congratulate each other     
for their graduation in those public reading classes    
    
Then, this world could have been a more humanly plane to live.    
    
But even after many years of human evolution     
Unfortunately, a human is still stuck in those     
Old books, which are not able to create human well being,     
peace on the planet, respect for the environment,     
respect for other creatures and other humans around    
    
And, still, we call human has evolved from     
an animal being to a human being.     
Do you think so?    
    
Even with all so-called science and technology     
Human is still wildest animal on this planet     
If you don’t believe that then     
Next 5 years remove all religious books     
Remove their ten commandments     
Remove their fear of hell and heaven     
Remove their fear of the law of karma     
And give them the best technology and     
environment for learning and best physical health.    
    
You think humans will be happy. Unfortunately not!     
Because there was almost no investment     
on making humans reasonable, sensible, and respectful to others.     
There is not enough sincere investment     
in teaching human about     
how to manage emotions, lust, temptation, greed, and anger.    
    
No matter what book they read     
some are violent all the time     
Some are waiting for little provocation     
So how to handle human society in this situation?    
    
Is it possible to make human society sensible     
and sensitive without religion?    
    
Can technology and science do that for humans?     
If no then why we are so much against the religion?    
    
Yes, religion has caused many problems     
in human society     
but why don’t we understand     
we reached to 21 century because of religion.    
    
The problem is not in religion     
This is an old tool to control and rule     
This always will remain.    
    
The problem is we don’t have the courage     
to reject those old books of religion     
and create a new book of love and respect for all.    
    
A thinker like Kabira &amp; Basavanna come and go     
But follower create another religion     
from the teachings of their masters     
And society again has different levels of conflicts.    
    
The problem is people think old is gold     
Mine is the oldest, my people told it long back, they were wise.    
    
We need to understand the question is not about     
my people or their people     
Neither the question is about     
who said what and when.    
    
The Question is can human keep aside something,     
which is not making sense for the well being of human,     
other lives around, environmental and mother earth.    
    
The question is can human think again, look forward     
Live with his senses and sensibly     
Live with his experience     
Do not live in a false paradise that I know     
my people know, my ancestor knew everything.     
But question everything around in a respectful way.    
    
O Pratibimba! Is this too much expectation     
From the human of this planet,     
That she/he keep aside all this morality,     
commandments and religion     
and live like human?
