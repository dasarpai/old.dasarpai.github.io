#  Thanks To Covid19   
   
We are a nation where people can pee anywhere  
spit anywhere and sneeze on anybody’s face.  
Thanks to corona some control has come.

We are a society where foreign travel and  
mad travel was considered a sign of high class and busy-ness  
Today that person is considered a potential source of Corona.

When our Jain Munis were moving around  
with a mask on their face world was making fun of them  
and we also joined them  
today everybody is looking for that Jain Muni Mask.

We are the society which said eat vegetarian,  
Don’t kill animals to fill your stomach and  
World laughed at our silly logic  
and we also joined that group  
Today people are looking for a salad and vegetarian food.

We use to greet everybody with Ram Ram Ji and Namaste  
and western people made fool of us  
They shake the hand and we liked their idea  
and we adopted that habit over a period of time  
Today world is going back to Namaste  
and we need to tell each other that no hand-shake.

While learning a new habit of eating with spoon and fork  
we have forgotten our traditions have told us  
to wash our hand and mouth  
before and after we eat something.

Using water and soap to clean hands and body  
after every inflow in the body and outflow from the body  
not the paper to eat with and paper to clean toilet or hand.  
Those traditions will be valued now.  
Thanks to Corona to help us learn  
why these practices were part of our traditions.

Our elders used to say why you run unnecessarily  
when there is no work or work can be done from home  
You are burning petrol, going to the mall, cinema hall  
going to college to make your attendance,  
or to the office just sign a register.  
Better sit at home talk to family members.  
But we didn’t pay attention.  
Thanks to corona traffic in the sky and on the road are less  
Whether people are talking to each other  
Contemplating, meditating, praying, playing with each other  
or watching TV shows only they know.

Pakistan and India were not talking for long  
Finally, we sat together face to face to talk  
But the result is zero, we are discussing Corona  
and Pakistan again discussing Kashmir.  
For the entire world, Corona is pandemic  
and it is a huge challenge  
For Pakistan the only problem is Kashmir!

Thanks for Corona many good things are happening  
Hope when Corona get arrested  
People will come to know there is  
nothing unconnected in this world  
All are connected to all.  
So live sensibly and do not thrive on others’ misery.

By the time Corona get arrested I hope  
People will come to know that  
apart from this mad race  
there is something more important in life.

By the time Corona get arrested, I know economies will realize that  
Business like travel and tourism are  
high-risk business for the future.  
If your economy depends too much upon this  
then you can crash in no time  
and an enemy can kill you without hitting and bleeding you.

Hari Om Tat Sat  
Yours Truly Hari
