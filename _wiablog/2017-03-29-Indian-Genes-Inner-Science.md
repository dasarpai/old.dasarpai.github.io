## Indian Genes Inner Science

    
With time we explore the world outside     
With time we dive into the world inside     
Outside means which is available to all     
All who have senses of seeing, hearing, etc.     
Can explore the outside.    
    
Inside means which is not available to our senses     
For example food, you can search outside but hunger is inside     
The beauty you see outside but lust is inside     
Music is outside but the ability to enjoy is inside     
Money is outside but the ability to give     
the direction and purpose of the money is inside    
    
Relationships are physical and hence bondage outside     
but the sense of freedom is inside     
Your favorite dish is on the table but the enjoyment is inside     
A cut is on the skin, outside, but the pain is inside     
Abusive words are outside but anger is inside     
Every sensitive mind can explore inside.    
    
When you live on the land which has sun all the time of the year,     
six seasons, flora and fauna,     
hundreds of rivers and fountain around     
Then your outside need is taken care of by the nature.     
With little effort, you will be able to fill your stomach.    
    
Other things like house or cloth     
the more you work the more you accumulate.     
There is a start but no end to this.    
    
There have been people in all the time     
who observed the human life cycle carefully     
and asked this question, What next?     
Now what to do in the remaining time.    
    
In this spirit, they landed into exploring inside     
And it became so interesting for them that     
they knew whatever is inside     
is exactly outside in the universe    
    
So, some thought why to search outside, endlessly     
If we put our life in understanding inside then     
In lesser time we can understand     
everything inside and outside both.    
    
That land is called Bharat, India.     
If you keep aside suffering, invasion,     
suppression, conversion     
of one thousand years aside     
and including today’s time     
Then you will find Indians are highly spiritual in nature     
Because external is taken care of by nature     
so they didn’t rush much for outer accumulation     
Competition, show-off,     
Neither Indian valued those much.    
    
On this land a person who leaves everything,     
One’s family, property, friends, life mission     
And perform his final rite,     
the rite of cremation with his own hands.     
And after this, he walks on the earth     
Knowing that he doesn’t exist     
What is walking now is a body     
which is given by the Grace of Guru     
It has come out from that funeral pyre     
And now he doesn’t have     
his own desire and determination    
    
He doesn’t cook for himself     
He doesn’t build anything for himself     
He doesn’t earn money     
He lives with a begging bowl     
He lives with his Guru given body     
He lives for self-realization, teaching     
and strengthening society,     
through his presence he reminds society     
About selflessness.     
Then he is called Swami (Lord).    
    
Those who remain hooked to the     
Families, properties, friends, and relatives     
They are called “Samsari” (worldly),     
“Daasa” (slave) of the objects.     
So Daasa who has everything     
Go to a Swami who has nothing     
To get something or everything whatever he need.     
What a beautiful concept is this!    
    
In today’s time because of     
western influences and missionary work     
All this looks confusing to the people in our society.    
    
In the last thousand years to survive     
We have developed and copied different     
methods for our cultural existence.     
And in this process, lots of change happened     
to our original thought process as well.    
    
Indians are not foolish to reject the material world     
It was so much available to them     
That they never gave importance     
to something which was in abundance or always available.    
    
Now people have much more     
to live a comfortable life than our ancestors had     
Now even western people have enough     
which their ancestors never had     
So when comforts are taken care of, outside is taken care     
Then why run so much in the outside direction?    
    
Ancient people were much wiser     
They chose to spend time     
In research, discovery, and contemplation    
    
Nowadays when we don’t have enough problems     
Then we invent a problem for others or for ourselves     
And spend time solving those problems!    
    
We are losing those genes     
given to us by our ancestors.     
A curious mind, original thinker, deep thinker     
contemplative, meditative, always seeking mind     
are originated from that gene.    
    
Very soon a day may come     
when with abundant resources around     
we will become so much materialistic     
that we don’t know how to live joyfully and peacefully.    
    
We are going in the direction     
where we can remain restless and peace-less     
with all the wealth, comforts, and technologies around.    
    
When you have enough time     
Then seek that which you don’t know     
Or solve that puzzle that is mysterious for you.     
Rather than multiplying your comforts and     
increasing your security and insurance!    
    
O Pratibimba, do you think     
That I do not know all this?     
I know this but where is the time?     
The time to seek, ask, contemplate.     
I am busy in gossips, TV, news, politics,     
laughter shows because that gives me     
a temporary rest from a hectic day    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Yours Truly Hari
