## What Is Love?       
    
Normally people think love is between opposite genders.     
Some people think love is about sex.     
There are enough minds who don’t perceive     
any difference between this four-letter word     
and another four-letter English word.     
You know what I mean.     
Other people say I love shopping.     
There are some who say I love eating, sleeping, dancing.    
    
People say they fall in love.     
Some others say they are crushed by love.     
There are some who feel cheated and robbed in love.    
    
People say love is blind.     
There are people who feel love happens between equals.     
Some people say love can spoil you, so be cautious.    
    
Some say love is Bhakti.     
Others say in love, we surrender completely.     
Some say love is unconditional.     
Business people say love is a transaction.    
    
Life exists at multiple levels.     
Like onion has many layers     
And each layer is made of different color, size, smell, geometry     
All layers make that onion     
Remove all layers, there is no physical entity called onion.    
    
Life exists at multiple levels.     
Physical, Emotional, Intellectual, and Energy     
Each layer is complex enough.     
Each layer has its own function and contribution to our existence.     
Which layer you experience more     
that depends on how deeper you could dive into     
the existential ocean called cosmos or life.    
    
Love is a force of attraction.     
Love is a force of nature.     
When you see clouds dancing on the chest of a mountain they are in love.     
When you see Chataka bird does not drink water     
and wait for a drop of water from rain. She is in love.     
When a sunflower aligns herself toward the sun that is love.    
    
When farmer sow some seed in the earth     
and nurture the earth with his love     
Then earth returns a plant     
That is the exchange of love.     
That is why the earth is called mother     
and Farmer is called father.    
    
When you throw something above     
And it falls back to earth     
It is because of the attraction of earth called love.    
    
When you behave appropriately with animals     
They become harmless for you     
That is the power of your love.    
    
When you think you are giving more and other is giving less     
Your love is moving towards a transaction.     
When you say “I love you” then peep inside     
there are chances you are not feeling it.     
When you feel the loss of words     
but overflowing energy from within     
there is high chance you are in Love.    
    
To love you don’t need love from others     
Love is your capacity and capability     
It doesn’t become less or more within you     
because of other person’s behavior     
When you are empty or have less feeling of love     
then, a miser is your guide, you want to give little by little     
only at those places from where you get it equal or more.    
    
When you say I cannot live without you     
That is the crutch of dependence, not love.     
Some love this kind of crutch.    
    
When some say I love only you     
And you both believe in that statement     
There are chances you both have not     
understood the meaning of     
that word as existential reality.    
    
When you see a beautiful flower in someone’s garden     
Then given an opportunity what do you of that flower?     
You fall in love!     
After some time you pluck it from the branch.     
Keep in your pocket,     
Or offer at the feet of your God     
Or offer it to your sweetheart.     
Or keep it on your table.     
That is the way generally humans handle love.    
    
Cut it, hold it, possesses it.     
Have sex, make it a slave of your desires.     
Either be mine or perish.     
This they call love,     
it is another name of cruelty and not love.    
    
Let that flower be on the branch.     
Appreciate it there.     
Touch it and let it dry and fall it there.     
If you really love that flower     
then what is your business to pluck it?     
As if the flower is saying     
I want to give my life for your love.     
Cut me from the branch and finish me.    
    
Matter, Energy, and Consciousness     
are three truths of our existence.     
You are a consciousness.     
In that consciousness you love.     
All feelings are energy     
And you feel that     
because you have matter called body.    
    
Energy can remain subtle, constructive, or violent.     
Love is the energy of construction.     
Love is energy that empowers us to surrender and give.     
Love is energy emitting from silence     
Love is energy with which you feel liberation     
Love is energy in which you are not physical     
but a weightless balloon.     
Love is that emotion where you are emotions botched up     
You don’t know you are smiling     
or crying or numb without words.    
    
You Pratibimba, this is what I experience about     
this overly used multi-loaded word, called love.     
What is your experience of love?     
Not what you think about love!    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Yours Truly Hari.
