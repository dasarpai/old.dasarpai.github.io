# Logic of Entangled Mind      
    
Saints, Mahatmas, Rishis of the East Developed a philosophy     
And they told that there are millions of life     
Human life is precious among those lives.    
The best time to come out of this     
unending cycle of birth and death is human life.    
    
They told us human life is especial     
Because human is rational, intellectual    
Human can think, observe, read, contemplate, meditate and     
transcend his physical nature and know himself as Bhraman.    
They can do Sat-Asat vivek,    
They can do Nitya-Anitya vivek.    
    
In fact these sages were telling us     
You have lived millions of life,    
The way you are suffering in this life     
You have suffered millions of time earlier,    
Are you not frustrated yet? Are you not ful yet?     
What other juice you are looking into this sand?    
Wake up, live a meaningful life,    
Think beyound your physical existence     
Know yourself as Chaitanya.    
    
But, the people of east become so lazy     
Forget about working for Moksha or doing Nitya Anitya Vivek,    
We don't have time sense,    
Because there are millions of life.    
We are so bad in time sense that Kabirdas Ji     
need to remind us "Kaal Kare So Aaj Kar"    
    
Western philosopies came later,    
Perhaps their philophers learned from the experience of the East.    
So they told their people     
There is only life,    
By the grace of the God you have become human therefore     
Live such a life that you remain near to that who gave you life.    
    
Those people thought life is only one,    
There are so many interesting things in the life to enjoy,    
Life is sort and we have to experience everything,     
Therefore do everything in this life,    
In this process they became so much materialisic that they don't care about the Soul, Atman, Brahman, God etc.    
    
Oh Pratibimba, the tragedy of the human mind is such     
That is impossible to save human,    
Even if God work hard for human,    
Because all the time human is praying for more material and more entangledment.    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat-Asat    
Yours Truly Hari
