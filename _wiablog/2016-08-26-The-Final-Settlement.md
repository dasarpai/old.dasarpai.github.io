# The Final Settlement
    
A man from a village,     
Met me after so many years.     
I could recognize him as my childhood friend Pratibimb.     
We together were very happy to see each other.     
We decided to spend a whole day together,     
At a place that was free from the hustle-bustle of the city.     
So, we went to a hilltop near the city.    
    
After settling there on a hill rock     
I asked him what are you doing?     
Where are you nowadays?     
Where are you settled?    
    
As soon as he listened the word settle     
he became a little nostalgic.     
After some time he told me     
Oh, settlement! I will tell you my journey,     
and then he started.    
    
I am a child from a very small village of this nation     
After education, I moved to the city to earn my living     
There I got a lot to learn and little to earn     
Here in this city one day I am met, my cousin     
He asked me, brother, what are doing?     
When are you getting settled?    
    
I told him since the last three years I working in this city     
Changed my jobs three times     
because of reasons beyond my control     
I never complained about those but I wanted to get settled.    
    
I am trying, but it is not happening     
In spite of all this, I am happy     
Because I have learned so many things     
in a short time in this strange city.    
    
My cousin told me learning is fine     
But where is the earning?     
See me. I am almost the same age as you.     
I am having a good job, making good money     
Recently got married and taking care of my small family     
I have settled before you.    
    
I said I am not against settlement     
But that is not my control.     
Although I am more qualified educationally than you     
but you are more qualified than me     
to give the answer to the question of settlement.    
    
He told me that I should keep     
my learning side by side and focus on earning.     
Look Opportunity to earn, learning will happen there     
and even if doesn’t happen that is fine     
Because, how long we will keep learning we are getting older?     
Getting settled is more important in life.    
    
I was puzzled over this conversation     
I was seeking the answer to my settlement     
I tried hard for two more years,     
but more than newer experiences of life I didn’t get much.    
    
Whenever I got a new job     
I got a new domain to learn     
I will pay money from my pocket     
and after job hours in the evening burn my nights,     
register for courses, diplomas &amp; certificates     
and learn that domain and get certified.     
This way journey kept going on.    
    
After two years I moved far away, from that city     
There was a new environment so more learning     
Thus new jobs, new places and     
working with new people was my way.    
    
Then came the time when my father asked     
Are you settled, the reason was obvious.     
I told, I want to settle but I am not able to settle     
He asked me, how long it will take to settle?     
I had that standard reply     
It is not in my hand,     
But I am happy I am learning.    
    
My father told me all your friends and cousins     
got settled but you are accumulating     
education, knowledge, degree, experience.     
What is the use? Get settled my son.     
All can happen parallel.     
Learning doesn’t stop in life, even if you get settled.    
    
I was like a wandering monk     
Kept moving alone, from one job to another,     
From one city to another     
Only with my wisdom     
But always happy     
Some get settled with a place     
Some get settled with money     
Some get settled with relations     
I was settling in myself.    
    
The question of settlement is thrown to me     
Whenever friends, colleagues, relatives are around     
**Where** are you settled?    
    
Probably by this time they assumed that I am settled     
That is why the question is “Where”     
Today on this beautiful hill     
Can I ask you a question?    
    
I said, well you are my childhood friend     
We are very close to each other     
You can ask me anything     
I will give my best reply if not true     
I quizzed him.    
    
He smiled and told     
Can you please tell me,     
The meaning of settlement?    
    
I was happy that I finally     
he is asking this question to a wise person like me.     
I got the opportunity to give wisdom to my best friend.    
    
So, I started speaking to him     
Without stopping, I continued for fifteen minutes     
But more I was speaking     
more emptiness I was experiencing in me     
Finally, I told, I have spoken a lot     
This is what I know and I meant by the settlement     
But I am also not happy with this answer.    
    
He told me, if you, who is settled,     
do not know the answer,     
Then how come who is rolling like a ball on this planet will know?     
Yes the desire to settle was there in me     
But now that desire itself has settled.    
    
Oh, I said, how come your desire of settling     
got settled before you settle in your life?    
    
My friend told me     
For me, life is a journey     
This life is just a station in that larger journey     
For me, neither life started at my birth     
Nor it will end at my final departure from the body     
I will continue in some other form at some other place    
    
So, tell me a place where I should build     
a palace for my permanent settlement?     
Many times I have built big palaces earlier     
and I got kicked out by the time     
This time I am thinking of not building any.    
    
Everything is taken on rent here     
Never try to buy anything     
Take everything on rent,     
Use it with respect and then give that back to the owner     
Thank giver for giving me the opportunity to use    
    
I am no more than a custodian     
of those things with which I enjoy life     
Once done then leave surroundings and objects     
around in good condition and move on.     
So that others after me can enjoy this planet.    
    
I took my mother womb on rent     
so that I can manifest in physical form.     
My mother helped me,     
I came out from that settlement and thanked her     
Then my father gave me his house to live and study     
I studied and came out and thanked him    
    
Several people have given me their houses in the cities to live     
I lived in their houses and moved out and thanked them     
Several employers gave me the opportunity to learn and earn     
I worked, earned, and learned. I thanked them and moved out    
    
In fact this body, I have taken on rent from this mother earth     
On top of that, daily I take some more loan from her in the form of food     
But daily I thank her     
She allows me to walk on her chest     
And do whatever best I could     
She took my weight and side effects of my living here     
She tolerates my ignorance every day     
So one day I will say a final thank you     
for this body to the Mother earth.    
    
Mentally I am settled, I am happy     
So settle that I do not have anything to lose, so no fear.     
So settle that I can work as hard as a donkey     
without bothering day and night.     
So settle that if I have to leave this body right away on this hilltop     
I am not afraid, I know I will come back     
and restart again around the same.     
Lapse of few ten-twenty years here and there will happen     
But in eternity that does not matter.    
    
In this life,     
No desire to build an empire     
No desire to give big donations &amp; building big temples     
No desire to live a lavish life     
But a strong desire to work hard with this body and mind     
To learn, understand and experience life in the best possible way     
Thus I keep moving    
    
Now tell me in this continuous migration     
how to get settled &amp; where?     
It looks, I am settled for a constant     
whose name is “the change”.    
    
As my friend was puzzled many years ago     
I am puzzled today. Why?    
    
Because I thought settlement means     
Having a big apartment in the best society in the city.     
Having children and Giving them the best education.     
Helping them getting settled in their job &amp; life.     
Buy the costliest car and show it to my friends.     
Take all of them on a long ride and enjoy yourself with them.    
    
Before getting old and dying,     
see all the place on this planet,     
as if this the first and last time here.     
Because they are saying “Jindagi Na Milegi Dobara”     
And if possible go and see the moon also.    
    
Eat everything and drink everything possible,     
because that is why God has created     
all these things for we human     
Apart from that human is also creating     
so many interesting technologies to enjoy     
It is not for me then for whom?    
    
But for all that I need to make lots of money     
That is why I working so hard.     
And this crazy man is saying     
I am finally settled in this constant changing world     
I don’t see that he got settled     
Still roaming, nothing fixed.    
    
Finally, my friend told me     
Hari, this whole cosmos is mine     
Based on the need, I can live wherever I want     
When this whole cosmos has been built for me     
And I can live wherever I want,     
The only thing is I need to take care of is my Karma,     
Then where is a question of creating a house     
inside the house to get Final Settlement?    
    
O merciful Reader, if you are settled in life     
Can you tell me whether my friend Pratibimba is foolish or wise?     
Because I asked him a question and     
now I myself am trapped in that question.    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Your Truly Hari
