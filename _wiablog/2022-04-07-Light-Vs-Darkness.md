## Light vs Darkness

    
    
Darkness in the whole existence is natural.    
It need not be created.    
Darkness is universal.    
But by effort if you can bring light     
then darkness disappears!    
    
Where does it go?     
Does it get contracted or Displaced?    
If you light all the places then     
will there be lessor darkness     
in the world because it has been displaced?    
    
Like total energy and mass     
of the universe is conserved    
Total darkness and light     
of The Existence is conserved.    
You cannot eliminate darkness by light.    
    
Matter is another form of energy.    
They get transformed into each other.    
Energy replaces matter.    
You see a large iceberg,     
It can be turned into a huge power of steam.    
    
Darkness is another form of light.    
That another form is called absence of light.    
Darkness is light replaced by absence of light.    
    
Energy is more universal than matter.    
Darkness is more universal than light.    
    
Accepting the existence in totality mean     
accepting light and darkness together.     
Without disproportionately appreciating one over other    
Leads to accepting the existence in totality.
