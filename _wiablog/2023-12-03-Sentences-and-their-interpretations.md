# Sentences and Their Interpretations   
Once all villagers decided to pray for rain.    
On the day of prayer, all the people gathered,    
but only one boy came with an umbrella.       
This is faith or innocence?   
   
When you throw babies in the air,    
they laugh because they know you will catch them.      
This is trust or helplessness or ignorance?   
   
Every night we go to bed without any assurance of being alive the next morning,    
but still we set the alarms to wake up.       
This is hope or our madness for the Karma?   
   
We plan big things for tomorrow in spite of zero knowledge of the future.    
That is confidence or choicelessness?   
   
We see the world suffering, but still,    
we get married and have children.    
That is love or trishna or insenity?   
   
On an old man's shirt was written a sentence    
'I am not 80 years old; I am sweet 16 with 64 years of experience.'    
This is attitude or childishness or fear of death?   
   
They say good friends are the rare jewels of life,    
difficult to find and impossible to replace!!    
I say, do we really search and find friends,    
or people come from unknown direction and some become friend.    
And how long they will remain friend that is not in our hands,    
some will become enemy, some will go away    
and some will leave the planet before us.   
We don't search and find them,   
they just come before and we recongine them.   
They disappear and we recall them.
