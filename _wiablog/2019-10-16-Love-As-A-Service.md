## Love As A Service   
   
Have you ever seen a person     
Who hires someone else to love     
his/her spouse and children?    
    
It is unthinkable,     
we call that person     
out of his mind.    
    
Have you seen any person     
Who hires someone to write poetry and sing     
for his/her loved one or for his/her spouse?    
    
You will say,     
This is madness,     
Better remain silent     
what is the use of doing this nonsense     
If you truly love someone and     
That person is in his/her sense     
then he/she will know.     
If not then this business of hiring     
some else to please     
your loved one will not go long.    
    
But there are enough people who say     
they believe in God     
They love their God.     
But they hire someone else     
to do the prayer on their behalf.    
    
Not only that they cannot write     
their own feeling towards their god.     
So they read books to please their God.    
    
They hire musicians to sing     
on their behalf before their God     
Once the program is over     
They think their God is happy.    
    
There are enough number of people     
Who believe reading some prayer or     
some book 3 times or 5 times a day     
will keep their God happy and     
they can avoid His wrath.    
    
Those who believe in this kind of God     
Or this trick of pleasing their God     
Their God is not much intelligent than     
their own small thinking.     
In this situation, even if their God becomes happy     
what that unintelligent God can do for them?    
    
If your God is omnipresent,     
omnipotent, omniscient     
Then that God must be expecting     
some basic intelligent from you     
Why do you consider Him fool and     
play the trick with Him?    
    
O Chaitanya, if you love someone sincerely     
then do not hire someone else     
to praise or pray before that.     
Spend time, put your heart and mind     
Get soaked into that love.     
Love can never be sold as a service.    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Yours Truly Hari    
    
Until Next Time Stay Blessed
