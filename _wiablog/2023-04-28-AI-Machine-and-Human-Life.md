# AI Machine and Human Life

Just because Calculator's are there 
human stopped counting mentally 
and stopped doing maths of paper.
Just because AssemblyAI is there 
human want to speak and document 
without thinking and writing.

Because car's and moterbikes are there 
human stopped walking.
Because mobile and social media is there 
people stopped putting efforts 
in smoothing relations with the people living around.

Just because planes are there 
human goes on long journey 
skipping the joy of travelling along with river, 
On the unknown tracks in the forest
walking up and down on the mountains.

Just because DALLE and MidJourney can generate awesome image 
Will human drop the camera down?

Because digitial watches are there human 
stopped counting the life using their breath.

Machines and AI, they've come so far
They've made our lives easier, that's for sure
But have we stopped to think, what they've cost?
Have we lost our humanity, in what we've gained?

Our brains may rust, our skills may fade
Our reliance on machines, may makes us Ghost

Human mind is evolved over thounsands year
Around thinking, writing, drawing on wall 
and papers using ink and chalk.
Will it matter longer in the future?

WishperAI is generating music 
Will human drop Guitar, Piano, Drum and Santoor listen 
Guitar, Piano, Drum and Santoor music without these instrument?

In the time to come autonoums vechicles will takes us 
to all the place on the land, in water and in sky.
Will human stop learning to drive, 
flying the plane and swimming in the water?

When Robots are making good food at home or in restaurant 
Then will mothers stop preparing food for the children?
Will Mother order via AI, from AI, made by Robot 
and eaten by her Human child?

While teaching data science I emphasise 
on the strong foundation of maths, stats and programming.
Learners say, cloud based AI and AutoML tools are doing 
all this what is the benefits of learning this?

When teacher are teaching maths in the class
Half the time teachersa are lazy or they don't know.
Half the time students's are lazy and they don't want to know.
They want to pass the exam and have degree.

Who will do programming? AI like Copilet!
Who will do calculation? Calculator and Computers.
Who will write poetry? AI like GPT.
Who will compose music? AI like Whisper.
Who will write letters? AI like GPT.
Who will be hungry? Human.
Who will be tired? Human.
Who will be jelous? Human.
Who will fight with each other? Human.
Who will be rational and emotional at the time and make biased decision? Human.

We don't want machine should be biased.
We want them they be Yogi, Samatvam (equinamous).
If that is possible and we could make an unbiased AGI.
That would be supreme God. Who don't hate or favour any one.
This is better than today's human God who are jelous and biased.
It will be better than human 
who are biased and hateful no matter how matured they are.

Digital watches count our lives, but what of our breaths?
The simple joys of life, that we so often forget
Our humanity, it's slipping away
In our quest for comfort, we've lost our way

In this age of machines and digital tools,
We are faced with new challenges and rules,
For we have grown accustomed to using these tools,
And in doing so, we are become fool.

To be peaceful we need drugs,
To be healty we need doctor,
To travel we need driver,
To take relationship advice we need advocate
Alas this dependency either on human doctor or advocate 
Or on the drug or alcohols or clubs and parties
We have forgot we are human
Who has capability to create everything from within
But we live so much outside 
That we forgot we have inner dimension of living.

O Chaitanya, we have lost touch with our human essence,
Our ability to reason and make sense,
Of the world around us, and in our absence,
We have let technology take precedence.

Hari Om Tat Sat
Yours Truely Hari
