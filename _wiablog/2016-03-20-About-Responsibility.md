# About Responsibility      
    
Responsibility is a Noun. But it takes birth from a verb “ability”.     
The ability to respond is called responsibility    
    
Who is that living being who cannot respond?     
Only dead cannot respond!     
The question is about choice.     
To something, we want to respond to some others not.     
But that is called freedom.     
Who is that wise person who wants to renounce his freedom?    
    
I see a wonderful sunrise, I respond or not it is in my freedom of choice.     
I hear wonderful music, I respond or not it is in my freedom of choice.     
Somebody hurt me, I respond or not it is my freedom of choice.     
Somebody hit me, I respond or not it is my freedom of choice.     
Somebody hit my nation, my people, my relation, and things around me,     
I respond or not it is my freedom of choice.    
    
So, I retain the ability to respond to the situation around me.     
Whether to respond or not, how to respond,     
when to respond is my freedom of choice     
This is the way of the wise.    
    
But, when I say I am not responsible     
What does it mean?     
It is dead for me or     
I am dead for that or     
Don’t blame me for this.    
    
Mostly I want to say third     
But I forget to understand that     
“Ability” to respond is from the verb Ability.     
Blame is another verb.     
Why mix up these two verbs and I become stone?     
Like a stone, I have lost my ability to respond,     
so I am not responsible.    
    
I need to convince my heart that     
Being a human, no matter how powerful I am, I have limitations.     
Limitation because of body,     
A limitation which I self impose because of traditions.     
A limitation which law of the land and society imposes upon me     
A limitation because of the availability of resources.     
And these limitations restrict me to physically act on the events around me.    
    
But, responsibility is more to do with the mental act.     
Mentally I can act whatever way I want.     
A “freedom to think”, no one take away from me.     
Until somebody sits inside my mind and control my thoughts.     
It is me who needs to decide what to think and whatnot.     
But unfortunately, bodily impulsiveness and     
the world’s temptations control my mind.    
    
I run to this world like mad     
My thoughts are controlled by the surrounding     
Thus I surrender my freedom     
“A freedom” with which I think and say I am responsible.
