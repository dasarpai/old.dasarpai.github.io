# Comprehensive Glossary of LLM
I am developing this Glossary slowly at my own pace. Content on this page keep changing. Better definition, better explaination are part of my learing, my evolution and advancement in the field of Deep Learning and Machine Learning. As of Aug'23 the terms are not in any order therefore if you are look for any specific term you can search on the page. When I will have 50+ terms on this page then I will try to sort them on some attribute of these terms.

## Learning Types
**Transfer Learning:** Transfer learning refers to the process of training a model on one task and then transferring its knowledge to a related task. In the context of NLP/Deep Learning, this typically involves training a large language model (LM) on a massive amount of text data using a self-supervised learning approach. Self-supervised learning involves training the model to predict missing words in sentences or other similar tasks without requiring explicit labels for the entire dataset. The result is a model that learns a rich representation of language and its underlying patterns.

Once this pre-training is done, the learned knowledge can be transferred to various downstream tasks by fine-tuning the pre-trained model. Transfer learning is highly effective because it allows the model to leverage the general language understanding it has gained from a diverse range of data. This often results in significant improvements in performance compared to training models from scratch for each specific task.

**Fine-Tuning:** Fine-tuning is the process of taking a pre-trained model, which has already learned general language patterns, and then adapting it to perform well on a specific task. In fine-tuning, the model is further trained on a smaller dataset that is specific to the target task. The idea is to adjust the pre-trained model's parameters to better align with the nuances and characteristics of the task at hand.

Fine-tuning typically involves training the top layers of the pre-trained model while keeping the lower layers, which capture more general language features, frozen. This is because the lower layers have already learned useful representations of language that are likely to be relevant across different tasks.


**Pre-trained Models:** These are large neural network models that have been trained on massive amounts of data to learn general language patterns. Examples include GPT-3, BERT, RoBERTa, and more. These models serve as the basis for transfer learning and fine-tuning.

**Downstream Tasks:** These are specific tasks that you want to solve using a pre-trained model's knowledge. Examples of downstream tasks include text classification, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, question answering, machine translation, etc.

**Feature Extraction:** This refers to using a pre-trained model as a feature extractor, where the model's intermediate layers' outputs are used as features for a downstream task. This avoids fine-tuning the entire model and can be useful when you have limited labeled data for fine-tuning.

**Domain Adaptation:** Domain adaptation focuses on adapting a pre-trained model to perform well on a target domain that might be different from the data it was pre-trained on. This is important when there is a domain shift between the pre-training data and the target task data.

**Data Augmentation:** Data augmentation involves creating new training examples by applying various transformations to the original data, such as adding noise, changing word order, or substituting synonyms. This can help increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's robustness.

**Multi-Task Learning:** Multi-task learning involves training a model to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. This can help improve the model's generalization abilities by leveraging shared knowledge across tasks.

**Zero-Shot Learning:** Zero-shot learning is a scenario where a pre-trained model can perform a task it has never been explicitly trained on. It can achieve this by using its general language understanding to reason and infer solutions based on provided prompts or instructions.

**Few-Shot Learning:** Few-shot learning extends zero-shot learning by allowing the model to see a small number of examples (few shots) from a new task before making predictions. This approach is useful when you have limited task-specific labeled data.

**Unsupervised Learning:** Unsupervised learning involves training a model on data without explicit labels. Pre-training a language model using self-supervised learning falls under this category, where the model learns from the inherent structure of the data.

**Semi-Supervised Learning:** This refers to training a model using a combination of labeled and unlabeled data. Pre-trained models can also benefit from this approach when fine-tuning on smaller labeled datasets.

**Supervised Learning:** In this learning machine learns the patters from the given data samples (X) and their predefined lables (y).

## Transformers

## Embedding in Transformer 

**Tokenization:** A process of breaking a sentence or bigger words into smaller words. Generally 750 words = 1000 tokens.
Sentence: "I love reading philosophyical literature"
Tokesn: I, love, read,ing, phil, osop, hyic, al , lite, ratu, re

**Token Encoding:** A process of assigning unique number to each token. If a word "pick" has come 5 times in a sentence and this word is encoded as 2075 then in the sentence this word will be replaced by 2075 at 5 place. Encoding is created for the token and not for the word.
Sentence: "I love reading philosophyical literature"
Tokesn: I, love, read, ing, phil, osop, hyic, al , lite, ratu, re
Encoding: 1001, 2005, 2230, 1, etc. As many tokens than many encoding. We get these numbers by assigning a unique number to unique words in the corpus.  

**Word Embedding:**	Fixed number vector of each token. Word embedding can be a 50 or 100, 200, 300 dimensional vectors. Higher the dimension better the words are represented but more time it take to learn the embedding. And more time it need to process this during the model training, down streaming task (finetuning), inferencing. Irrespetive of the context of the word embedding remains same. Keep in mind ideally these are token embedding.

**Position Embedding:** Embedding of position, which a token has in sentence. For each position corresponding position vector is generated. This is important because position of word in a sentence changes the meaning. "Dancing girl is here", "Girl is dancing here" does not have the same meaning. Without capturing the postion of a word we cannot understand the context of the word.

**Contxtual Embedding:** This is generated by combining word embedding + position embedding and then using self attention. Two sentences ""Dancing girl is here", "Girl is dancing here", girl word has come two time. Word embedding for both is the same. But, contextual embedding of the same word will be different and it depends upon the context it is used in.

### Architecture Types of Transformer
**Encoder:** When we are interested in predicting middle token from surrounding tokens, this is called encoding. Models of this architectures are called autoencoding models. BERT transformer is Encoder transformer.	

**Decoder:** When we want to predicting next word from previous words, this is called decoding. Models of this architecture are called autogressive models. GPT transformer is Decoder transformer.	

**Encoder-Decoder:** When we want to predicting corresponding word in language 2 from a parallel sentence in language 1. This is called encoding-decoing. This is also called sequence2sequence or seq2seq task. This kind of transformer is called encoder-decoder transformer. T5 transformer is Encoder-Decoder Model.

## AI Experiments

**What is playground mode in Colab?:** Playground mode is essentially just a pre-configured notebook thatâ€™s optimized for quick experimentation. Colaboratory sets up a Python environment with a bunch of commonly-used machine learning libraries already installed, including TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, and PyTorch. If somebody shares code with you need not to worry about pip install. Just run the code. Without configuration or pip install, code will run. Nothing can be saved in playground mode.

## Metrics

### MRR 
MRR stands for "Mean Reciprocal Rank," and it is a metric commonly used in information retrieval and evaluation tasks, including those in natural language processing (NLP). MRR is used to assess the effectiveness of ranking algorithms or systems in presenting relevant information to users. MRR is often applied to tasks such as question answering, search engines, and recommendation systems. A higher MRR indicates that relevant results tend to appear higher in the ranked lists, which suggests better user experience.

Step1: Ranking of Results: Imagine you have a system that retrieves a list of possible answers or documents in response to a user's query or question. These results are usually ranked based on their perceived relevance to the query.

Step2: Reciprocal Rank: For each query or question, the reciprocal rank of the first correct (relevant) result in the ranked list is calculated as 1 divided by the position of that correct result. If the correct result is the second item, the reciprocal rank would be 1/2; if it's the fifth, the reciprocal rank would be 1/5, and so on.

Step3: Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR): To calculate the MRR, you take the average of the reciprocal ranks across all queries or questions in your evaluation dataset. The formula for MRR is:

MRR = (1/N) * âˆ‘(1/rank_i)

N is the total number of queries or questions.   
rank_i is the position of the correct result for the i-th query.

### MAP 
MAP stands for "Mean Average Precision". MAP focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of ranking algorithms or systems

Step1: Ranking of Results: You have a system that retrieves a ranked list of possible answers or documents in response to a user's query or question.

Step2: Precision and Recall: Precision is the ratio of relevant items retrieved to the total number of items retrieved. Recall is the ratio of relevant items retrieved to the total number of relevant items in the dataset. These two metrics are often in tension with each other; increasing precision might result in lower recall and vice versa.

Step3: Average Precision (AP) for Each Query: For each query or question, you calculate the precision at each position in the ranked list where a relevant item is retrieved. You then calculate the average of these precision values, resulting in the Average Precision (AP) for that query.

Step4: Mean Average Precision (MAP): To calculate the MAP, you take the average of the Average Precision values across all queries or questions in your evaluation dataset. The formula for MAP is:

MAP = (1/N) * âˆ‘(AP_i)   

N is the total number of queries or questions.   
AP_i is the Average Precision for the i-th query.

## EM - Exact Match 
EM used in NLP task evaluation, particularly in tasks like question answering and text generation. The EM metric measures the percentage of predictions that exactly match the ground truth or reference answers.

If the model's answer matches the reference answer word-for-word, then the EM score for that particular instance is 1. If the answers do not match exactly, the EM score is 0. The EM score is then calculated as the ratio of instances where the model's answer matches the reference answer exactly to the total number of instances in the evaluation dataset.

## Distance Functions in Machine Learning
Every sample, record, word, sentence, object, image etc in the Machine learning language is called vector. If we want to measure the similarity or dissimilarity between two data points then we need distance function.

The choice of distance function depends on the specific task at hand and the properties of the data. For example, 
- the Euclidean distance is often used for tasks such as classification and regression, 
- the Jaccard distance is often used for tasks such as text classification, 
- the Mahalanobis distance is often used for tasks such as fraud detection.
- the Manhattan distance is often used for tasks such as clustering.

### Euclidean distance: 
This is the most common distance metric. It measures the distance between two points in a Euclidean space.

### Manhattan distance: 
This distance metric measures the distance between two points in a city block. It is also known as the L1 norm.

### Minkowski distance: 
This is a generalization of the Euclidean and Manhattan distances. It is defined by a parameter p, and the value of p determines the type of distance metric. For example, p=1 is the Manhattan distance, p=2 is the Euclidean distance, and p=infinity is the Chebyshev distance.

### Hamming distance: 
This distance metric measures the distance between two binary vectors. It is defined as the number of bits that are different between the two vectors.

### Cosine similarity: 
This distance metric measures the similarity between two vectors. It is defined as the cosine of the angle between the two vectors.

### Jaccard distance: 
This distance metric measures the similarity between two sets. It is defined as the size of the intersection of the two sets divided by the size of the union of the two sets.

### Overlap coefficient: 
This distance metric is similar to the Jaccard distance, but it is normalized to the range [0, 1].

### Sokal-Michener distance: 
This distance metric measures the similarity between two biological sequences. It is defined as the number of shared matches divided by the total number of characters in the two sequences.

### Mahalanobis distance: 
This distance metric is a generalization of the Euclidean distance. It takes into account the covariance of the data points.

### Wasserstein distance: 
This distance metric measures the difference between two probability distributions. It is often used in machine learning tasks such as anomaly detection and clustering.

### Chebyshev distance: 
This distance metric measures the maximum difference between two points. It is defined as the maximum absolute difference between the corresponding coordinates of the two points.

### Canberra distance 
This distance metric is a variation of the Manhattan distance. It is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between the corresponding coordinates of the two points, divided by the sum of the absolute values of the coordinates.

### Kendall tau distance: 
This distance metric measures the difference between the rankings of two items. It is defined as the sum of the number of times the two items are ranked in the opposite order.

### Spearman's rank correlation coefficient: 
This distance metric measures the correlation between the rankings of two items. It is defined as the Pearson correlation coefficient between the ranks of the two items.

### Jensen-Shannon divergence: 
This distance metric measures the difference between two probability distributions. It is defined as the average of the Kullback-Leibler divergences between the two distributions.

## Loss function: 
A function that measures the error between the predicted and actual values. It is used to train the deep learning model.
