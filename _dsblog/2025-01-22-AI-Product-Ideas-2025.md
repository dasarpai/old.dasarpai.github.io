# AI Product Ideas 

## Introduction

There is a flood of AI products in the market, yet some people are still searching for ideas to get started. The following list of ideas can serve as a good starting point for beginners, and even if you are already established, you may find some of these ideas inspiring.

Many of these ideas are available either as features of larger products or as standalone solutions. For example, they may exist as features in generic products like Google Drive, OneDrive, Outlook, or Office 365, or as part of domain-specific products such as Pharma Research tools, Banking CRMs, Loan Processing systems, or Project Requirement Management platforms.

Should you work on these ideas to learn and start? Definitely yes! Pick the ones that resonate with you the most and see them through. However, if you are looking at these ideas from the perspective of serious investment and product development, you need to consider the following:  
- **Who are the competitors of the product you want to build?**  
- **What are the features of those competing products?**  
- **What is their unique selling point?** Privacy, trust, security, scalability, performance, cost, rich features, integration with existing workflows, support, data portability, and easy migration are all critical aspects to evaluate. This requires thorough research before diving into building an AI product.

If you are wealthy, already running a business, or have customers ready to use your product, experimenting with any idea that suits your business might work fine. However, if you aim to create something for the broader market, keep in mind that the market is evolving rapidly. If you build a product but fail to adapt, you will fall behind. On the other hand, if you wait for the "perfect" opportunity, you may already be left behind in this fast-moving AI race.
