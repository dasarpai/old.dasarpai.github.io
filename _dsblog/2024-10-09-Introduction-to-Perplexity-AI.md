# Introduction to Perplexity AI

## What is Perplexity AI?
Perplexity AI Founded in 2022 is based in San Francisco, California. Perplexity AI is an AI-powered search engine that uses a large language model to answer questions and provide information. It is a free, open-source search engine that is built on top of the latest advancements in AI and natural language processing. Perplexity AI distinguishes itself as a unique blend of a search engine and an AI chatbot, offering several features that set it apart from traditional search engines like Google and other AI models such as ChatGPT.

## What are the Challenges which traditional search engines?
Some of these limitations are even with ChatGPT. 
- They are not able to provide real-time information.
- They are not able to provide direct answers with citations.
- They are not able to provide follow-up questions.
- Searching with multimedia on conventional search engine is not effective.
- Searching capability of many AI enabled search engines is limited to text.
- They are not able to provide a conversational interface with contextual memory.
- They are tied to limited AI models. 
- Not able to answers from my knowledge base.
- They are too verbose, especially search engines like Google, Bing provide too much information, often information overload.
- Too many ads and distractions.

## How does Perplexity AI work?

Perplexity AI uses a large language model to understand the user's query and provide a relevant answer. The language model is trained on a large corpus of data, including books, web pages, and other sources of information.


## Key Differences

### 1. **Real-Time Information Retrieval**
Perplexity AI utilizes advanced AI to perform real-time searches across the internet, gathering insights from authoritative sources. This capability allows it to provide up-to-date information, such as live sports scores or recent news articles, which traditional chatbots may not offer due to their reliance on static datasets [1][2].

### 2. **Multiple Language Models**
Unlike many AI tools that rely on a single language model, Perplexity integrates multiple large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4 and Claude 3. This diversity enhances its ability to understand user queries and generate more nuanced responses [2][3]. Users can choose from different models based on their needs, offering flexibility that is not commonly found in other platforms [3].

### 3. **Conversational Interface with Contextual Memory**
Perplexity engages users in a conversational manner, allowing for follow-up questions while retaining context from previous interactions. This feature creates a seamless dialogue experience, akin to conversing with a knowledgeable assistant rather than simply retrieving information [1][4].

### 4. **Direct Answers with Citations**
One of the standout features of Perplexity is its ability to synthesize information into concise summaries while providing citations for each piece of information. This transparency allows users to verify sources and explore topics further, contrasting with traditional search engines that often present lists of links without direct answers [2][3].

### 5. **Pro Search Features**
Perplexity offers two types of searches: Quick Search for immediate answers and Pro Search for more detailed inquiries. The Pro Search can ask clarifying questions to refine results, making it particularly useful for complex queries [1][2]. Free users have limited access to Pro Searches, while subscribers enjoy expanded capabilities [1].

### 6. **Multimodal Capabilities**
The Pro version of Perplexity also allows users to generate images and upload documents or images for more tailored responses. This multimodal functionality enhances its utility beyond text-based queries [3][4].

## What LLM does Perplexity AI use?
As of Oct'2024, perplexity uses the following LLM models:
- llama-3.1-sonar-small-128k-online
- llama-3.1-sonar-large-128k-online
