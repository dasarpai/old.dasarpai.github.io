# God Fathers of AI   

In other fields of studies or in religion, there is only one god or only one godfather. But in the field of AI, that is not the case. There are many pioneers or Godfathers who have done significant work in this field. Recently, the resignation of Dr. Geoffrey Hinton from Google raised eyebrows in the business world and in Governments the world over. Technology is good or bad, it depends upon whose hand it is. Geoffrey raised that concern and for that, he wants better controls in place. What will happen, we need to follow the progress and raise our voices around. In this article, I am mentioning some godfathers of AI, their workplaces, and their contributions. I am sure this will inspire many young minds.


*Age as of May 2023

1. **John McCarthy** (1927-2011, age 84)  **Worked at** : Stanford. **His Contribution** : Coined the term "Artificial Intelligence", developed the programming language LISP, and was a founding member of the MIT AI laboratory.
1. **Marvin Minsky** (1927-2016,  age 88)  **Worked at** : MIT. **His Contribution** : Co-founder of the MIT AI laboratory, developed the first neural network simulator, and made significant contributions to the fields of robotics and AI.
1. **Allen Newell** (1927-1992,  age 65)  **Worked at** : Carnegie Mellon. **His Contribution** : Co-developer of the General Problem Solver (GPS), one of the earliest AI programs, and made significant contributions to the field of AI in general.
1. **Judea Pearl** (1936- age 87)  **Worked at** : University of. **His Contribution** : Developed Bayesian networks and causal inference, which have been influential in the development of AI systems that can reason about cause and effect relationships.
1. **Geoffrey Hinton** (1947- age 76)  **Worked at** : University of Toronto. **His Contribution** : Pioneered the backpropagation algorithm for training neural networks, made significant contributions to the development of deep learning, and co-founded the Vector Institute for AI. Geoffrey Hinton joined Google in March 2013 when Google acquired his company DNNresearch Inc. He then became a distinguished researcher at Google and continued to work there until September 2021, when he announced that he was leaving Google to focus on his own research and startup.
1. **Rodney Brooks** (1954- age 69)  **Worked at** : MIT. **His Contribution** : Co-founder of iRobot and former director of the MIT AI laboratory, made significant contributions to the fields of robotics and AI, particularly in the area of autonomy.
1. **Yann LeCun** (1960- age 63)  **Worked at** : Facebook AI Research. **His Contribution** : Developed the convolutional neural network (CNN), which is widely used in computer vision systems, and made significant contributions to deep learning and AI.
1. **Kai-Fu Lee** (1961- age 62)  **Worked at** : Sinovation Ventures. **His Contribution** : Founded several AI companies, including Google China and Sinovation Ventures, and has been a key player in the development of the AI industry in China.
1. **Stuart Russell** (1962- age 61)  **Worked at** : University of California, Berkeley.. **His Contribution** : Co-author of the leading textbook on AI, "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach," and has made significant contributions to the development of AI, particularly in the area of probabilistic reasoning and decision-making under uncertainty.
