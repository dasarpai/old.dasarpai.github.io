# ML Model Development Framework & Model Repositories

## Introduction
There are hundreds of [machine learning tasks](/dsblog/nlp-tasks). To do these tasks there are [thousands of datasets](/dsblog/Type-of-Databases) created by individuals, governments, and corporations. We need to develop AI models using these datasets. There are thousands of models [1](dsblog/ML-Model-Repository-from-Pinto0309), [2](/dsblog/paperwithcode-resources), [3](/dsblog/What-Are-Transformers-in-AI) and many model development frameworks. It is practically mind-blowing to track this whole body of work and understand all this work in its entirety. But if you dive deeper into the following frameworks you will get a fair idea about the overall direction of the work. These frameworks are used to maintain pre-trained model repositories and download pre-trained models. You can develop your own finetuned model using those pre-trained models.
