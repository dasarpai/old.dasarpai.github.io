You **can use `reveal.js` presentations alongside your Hugo site using the Docsy theme**. They serve different purposes and can coexist smoothly with a bit of setup:

---

## ✅ What is `reveal.js`?

`reveal.js` is a JavaScript framework for building slide decks (HTML-based presentations). It's independent of Hugo or Docsy but can be integrated **as a standalone layout or content type** within your Hugo site.

---

## ✅ Integration Approaches

### 🔹 Option 1: **Static Integration (Recommended)**

Use reveal.js by directly including its assets and creating a custom Hugo layout for presentations.

#### 📁 1. Add reveal.js assets

Download or npm-install reveal.js, and copy its `dist` folder to your Hugo project:

```
your-hugo-site/
└── static/
    └── revealjs/
        ├── reveal.js
        ├── css/
        ├── js/
        └── plugin/
```

> Or link to CDN versions (e.g. via unpkg) to save size.

#### 📄 2. Create a presentation page

In `content/presentations/my-talk.md`:

```markdown
---
title: "My Reveal.js Talk"
layout: "reveal"
---

<section>
  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>This is a slide</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Another Slide</h2>
</section>
```

#### 🧱 3. Create a custom layout

In `layouts/_default/reveal.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>{{ .Title }}</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/revealjs/dist/reveal.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/revealjs/dist/theme/black.css">
</head>
<body>
  <div class="reveal">
    <div class="slides">
      {{ .Content | safeHTML }}
    </div>
  </div>
  <script src="/revealjs/dist/reveal.js"></script>
  <script>
    Reveal.initialize();
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Then navigate to `/presentations/my-talk/` to view it!

---

### 🔹 Option 2: Use a Hugo Module for Reveal.js

Some Hugo themes/modules offer reveal.js support. You could import such a module alongside Docsy via `config/_default/module.toml`, but it's usually overkill unless you're doing lots of slides.

---

### 🔹 Option 3: Use `shortcodes` to embed Reveal sections

You could create shortcodes for slides and use them inside normal Docsy pages — helpful for interactive guides or embedded decks.

---

## 🧠 Can You Mix Docsy and Reveal.js?

Yes — Docsy handles your main site layout, navigation, etc. You:

* Use reveal.js in a **dedicated section/layout**
* Avoid letting Docsy style or interfere with presentation pages
* Add navigation back to your Docsy site in the presentation if needed

## ✅ Summary

| Task                         | Tool                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Site structure, docs, layout | Docsy (Hugo theme)                    |
| Presentation slides          | reveal.js (JS presentation framework) |
| Integration method           | Custom layout or CDN assets           |
