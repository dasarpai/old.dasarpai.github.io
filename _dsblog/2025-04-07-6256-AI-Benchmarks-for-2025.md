# AI Benchmarks for 2025

A term **"AI benchmark"** is thrown around a lot and can be confusing because it’s used in slightly different ways depending on the context. In this artcile we will try to understand what are the different meaning of this term and what are the latest AI benchmarks. 

## **What Does "AI Benchmark" Mean?**

In general, an **AI benchmark** is a **standardized way to evaluate the performance** of an AI system and/or models. It is made of following components.

**Task** : The type of problem being solved. For example, Image classification, text generation, translation, reasoning etc.
**Dataset** : The data used to test performance of the model. For example, ImageNet, SQuAD, COCO, MMLU, etc.
**Metrics** : How performance is measured or what metrics are used to evalute the model performance. For example. Accuracy, F1 score, BLEU, perplexity, latency etc.
**Protocol** : The process or rules for how models are evaluated. Train/test split, few-shot vs. zero-shot, human feedback etc. 
**Leaderboard** : A ranked list of various model's performances on the against same benchmark. Papers With Code leaderboard, HuggingFace leaderboard 

So when someone says "AI Benchmark", they might be referring to:

- **Just the dataset** (e.g., "I used ImageNet as a benchmark")
- **A full evaluation suite** (e.g., "OpenAI's GPT-4 was tested on 20+ benchmarks")
- **The ranking of models** (e.g., "This model ranks #1 on SuperGLUE benchmark")
- **The task definition** (e.g., "Benchmarking code generation tasks")

For example, when someone say the model was evaluated against SuperGLUE (a famous NLP benchmark) benchmark it means.   

- **Tasks**: Textual entailment, QA, coreference resolution, etc.
- **Datasets**: MultiRC, ReCoRD, BoolQ...
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, F1, Exact Match, etc.
- **Benchmark**: The *whole suite*, with standard splits, rules, and a leaderboard
