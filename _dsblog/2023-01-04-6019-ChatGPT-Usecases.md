# What is ChatGPT?   
ChatGPT is **general purpose** - "chat model" from OpenAI. It is a **language model**, which means if you type some text then it can understand and respond to you appropriately. At this point in time, it is not accepting voice commands, neither able to process images or videos. A **general-purpose model** means it can understand the question coming from any domain of life. A domain may be vertical or horizontal. A vertical domain means where a vendor is supplying a product or service for a specific type of customer. A horizontal domain is where a vendor supplies products or services for all types of customer.  Healthcare, banking, logistic, insurance, agriculture, philosophy, history, and economics are one kind of verticals whereas 
BPO, Quality Management, Software Development, Taxation, HR, IT Security, Accounting, Office Administration, Catering, and Entertainment are other kind of domains. A **general-purpose model** can understand the questions from all aspects of life whether business vertical or horizontal or normal daily family or conflicts with other group members, family members, etc. 
 
Creating a general-purpose model is an extremely difficult task in AI. We are at the start of of 2023 and OpenAI's chat GPT is storming the market. With this kind of large language model, the AI journey is going to be very interesting. It is going to impact: the way we think, ask questions, solve problems, engage with others, share knowledge, value knowledge, and almost everything wherever knowledge is the key. In the coming time, people will improve their existing knowledge/information/data products. They will come up with domain-specific new products and the heart of those systems is going to be ChatGPT or similar products of the future. To create a ChatGPT kind of model you need millions of dollars, lots of data, hardware, and lots of time. But, running these systems is not easy in any way. You need expensive hardware to compute the parameters of these large language models. OpenAI said to perform a simple query on ChatGPT,  it takes 4-5 times more resources than the resources required on Google. But the kinds of results ChatGPT provides are far superior to SEO-optimized links thrown by Google on the screen. It is going to challenge Google. 

And wait, all this is based on GPT3. GPT4 is going to storm the market in the next couple of weeks or months.

# ChatGPT Usecases.
As I mentioned ChatGPT is a general-purpose language model system, therefore, I tried to ask different kinds of questions from this and took screenshots of the answer that it has thrown for me. I have spent some good time on this, explored it, and created many good use-case scenarios. But in the case of ChatGPT sky is the limit, you can do much more than what I am sharing with you. Let's see some applications of ChatGPT.

## Career Counselling with ChatGPT
Whether you are starting your career or in the mid of your career or want to switch your career, you have lots of questions. You don't get the right person to brainstorm or recommend.

## Poetry with ChatGPT
Poetry is a work of a creative and artistic mind. It is not easy to write poetry that too on any subject. I asked ChatGPT to write Shakespearian-style poetry on “time and life”. And it will force you to think if this machine is not thinking then what is thinking?

## SEO Keyword Search
Keyword planning is very tiring, boring, and painful work (at least for me). I provided some ideas to ChatGPT and asked it to recommend some keywords. It recommended some words, when I tried traffic for these words then it is reasonably good.
