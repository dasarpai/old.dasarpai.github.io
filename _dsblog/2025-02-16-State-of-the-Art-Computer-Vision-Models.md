# State of the Art Computer Vision Models

## What are the different methods of Image generation?

There are several methods for image generation. Diffusion models are currently the  state-of-the-art  due to their balance of quality, flexibility, and scalability. However, other methods like GANs and autoregressive models remain relevant for specific use cases. Let's see them one by one.


### **1. Diffusion Models**
Diffusion models are a class of generative models that work by gradually adding noise to data (e.g., images) and then learning to reverse this process to generate new data. Here's how it works:

#### **Key Steps in Diffusion Models:**

![Diffusion Model Steps](/assets/images/dspost/mermaid-code/dsp6219-Diffusion-Diagram.jpg)

#### **Variants of Diffusion Models**:
- **Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)**: The original formulation of diffusion models.
- **Latent Diffusion Models (LDM)**: Operate in a lower-dimensional latent space for efficiency (e.g., Stable Diffusion).
- **Classifier-Free Guidance**: Improves image quality by balancing conditional and unconditional generation.
- **Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)**: A continuous-time formulation of diffusion models.

#### **Advantages**:
- High-quality, photorealistic images.
- Flexible and controllable generation (e.g., text-to-image, image-to-image).
- Scalable to high resolutions.

#### **Examples Models**:
- DALL·E 3, Stable Diffusion, Imagen, Midjourney.

---

### **2. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**
GANs consist of two neural networks: a **generator** and a **discriminator**, which compete against each other.

#### **Key Steps in GANs**:

![GAN Model Steps](/assets/images/dspost/mermaid-code/dsp6219-GAN-Diagram.jpg)

#### **Advantages**:
- Fast image generation once trained.
- High-quality results for specific tasks (e.g., faces, landscapes).

#### **Challenges**:
- Training instability (mode collapse).
- Limited diversity in generated images.

#### **Examples**:
- StyleGAN, BigGAN, CycleGAN.

---

### **3. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**
VAEs are probabilistic models that learn a latent representation of data.

#### **Key Steps in VAEs**:
![VAE Diagram](/assets/images/dspost/mermaid-code/dsp6219-VAE-Diagram.jpg)

#### **Advantages**:
- Smooth latent space for interpolation.
- Good for tasks requiring structured outputs.

#### **Challenges**:
- Generated images are often blurrier compared to GANs or diffusion models.

#### **Examples**:
- VQ-VAE, NVAE.

---

### **4. Autoregressive Models**
Autoregressive models generate images pixel by pixel or patch by patch, conditioned on previously generated pixels.

#### **Key Steps in Autoregressive Models**:
1. Treat image generation as a sequence prediction problem.
2. Use models like Transformers or RNNs to predict the next pixel or patch.

#### **Advantages**:
- High-quality, detailed images.
- Flexible and scalable.

#### **Challenges**:
- Slow generation due to sequential nature.
- Computationally expensive.

#### **Examples**:
- PixelRNN, PixelCNN, Image GPT.

---

### **5. Flow-Based Models**
Flow-based models use invertible transformations to map data to a latent space and back.

#### **Key Steps in Flow-Based Models**:
1. Learn a bijective (invertible) mapping between the data distribution and a simple latent distribution (e.g., Gaussian).
2. Generate new images by sampling from the latent distribution and applying the inverse transformation.

#### **Advantages**:
- Exact likelihood estimation.
- Efficient sampling.

#### **Challenges**:
- Limited flexibility in architecture due to invertibility constraints.

#### **Examples**:
- Glow, RealNVP.

---

### **6. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)**
NeRF is a method for 3D scene reconstruction and generation.

#### **Key Steps in NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields)**

![](/assets/images/dspost/mermaid-code/dsp6219-NeRF-Diagram.jpg)


#### **Scene Representation (Implicit 3D Model)**
   - The 3D scene is represented as a **continuous volumetric function**.  
   - Instead of using meshes or point clouds, NeRF models a scene as a **neural network** mapping 3D coordinates to color and density.  
   - **Input:**  
     - A set of **2D images** of a scene taken from different angles.  
     - The **camera parameters** (position & direction) for each image.  

#### **Neural Network Prediction (Radiance Field Estimation)**
   - A deep neural network takes in **a 3D point (x, y, z) and a viewing direction (θ, φ)**.  
   - It predicts:  
     - **Color (R, G, B)** → Light emitted from that point.  
     - **Density (σ)** → How much light is absorbed at that point.  
   - This allows NeRF to model the appearance of a scene **from any viewpoint**.

#### **Volume Rendering (Synthesizing 2D Images)**
   - To generate an image, NeRF **traces rays** through the scene from the camera viewpoint.  
   - For each ray:
     - **Samples multiple points** along the ray in 3D space.
     - Uses the neural network to get **color and density** at each sampled point.
     - **Combines these values using volume rendering equations** to compute the final pixel color.  
   - This step **synthesizes realistic 2D images from new viewpoints**.

---

#### **Advantages**:
- High-quality 3D-aware image generation.
- Useful for tasks like view synthesis.

#### **Challenges**:
- Computationally intensive.
- Limited to 3D scenes.

#### **Examples**:
- GIRAFFE, DreamFusion.

---

### **7. Transformer-Based Models**
Transformers, originally designed for NLP, are now used for image generation.

#### **Key Steps in Transformer-Based Models**:
1. Treat images as sequences of patches or tokens.
2. Use self-attention mechanisms to model relationships between patches.
3. Generate images autoregressively or in parallel.

#### **Advantages**:
- Scalable to large datasets.
- High-quality results with sufficient compute.

#### **Challenges**:
- High computational cost.
- Requires large datasets.

#### **Examples**:
- DALL·E, Image GPT, Pathways Autoregressive Text-to-Image mode (Parti).
