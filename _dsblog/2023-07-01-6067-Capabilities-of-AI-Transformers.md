# Capabilities of AI Transformers

## Background
Whether GPT, ChatGPT, DALL-E, Whisper, Satablity AI or whatever significant you see in the AI worlds nowdays it is because of Transformer Architecture. Transformers are a type of neural network architecture that have several properties that make them effective for modeling data with long-range dependencies. They generally feature a combination of multi-headed attention mechanisms, residual connections, layer normalization, feedforward connections, and positional embeddings.   

Precursors of Transformers were RNN, LSTM, and GRU architecture. Transformers are based on the 2017 research paper ["Attention is All You Need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)


Initially, Transformers were used for NLP-related tasks. Slowly researchers started exploring the power of the Transformer Architectures and as of 2023 these are used for hundreds of tasks in different AI domains of technologies like:
- Text Models (NLP, NLU, NLG)
- Vision Models (Computer Vision)
- Audio Models (Audio Processing, Classification, Audio Generation)
- Reinforcement (RL) Models
- Time-series Models
- Multimodal: OCR (extract information from scanned documents), video classification, visual QA, table data question answering
- Graph Models

Starting the journey in 2017, as of now (2023) we have approx 200 Transformer based architectures proposed by various researchers for various purposes. Using these architecture and various benchmark datasets thousands of models have been created which give SOTA performance on various tasks. Based on your need you choose which architecture can help you meet your project objective. There are high chances you will get some pre-trained models which you can use without training (Zero-shot) or small finetuning (one-shot or few-shot) efforts. For that you need to explore [Huggingface](huggingface.co) and [PaperWithCode](https://paperswithcode.com/)

This articles list all the major Transformer related researcher paper, their object, and capabilities.

**Note :** Name starting with * are not Transformers, most of them are pretransformer age architectures.

## Conclusion
The purpose of this article is to give you a general understanding of the capabilities of the Transformer architecture. It is now up to you to decide which architecture is most suitable to your needs based on the task you have in front of you. Afterwards, you can use hugginface or tfhub to see if there are already models that have been trained using these architectures. The chances are that you will be able to complete your work using zero-shot transfer learning are high.
