## Introduction   
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Amazon uses for its e-commerce website. AWS offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, AI, analytics, application, and deployment services that help organizations move faster, lower IT costs, and scale applications.

As of May'23, AWS has over 210+ services that help organizations of all sizes and industries to build, deploy, and run applications. AWS services are available in over 190 countries and in 27 regions.
