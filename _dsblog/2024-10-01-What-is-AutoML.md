# Automated Machine Learning

## Is this article for me?
This is article is for you, if you know
- About Machine learning, ML models building
- That machines are capable of building these models themselves. 

But you don't know how it happens and what are different libraries available for this work.

## Question: What is AutoML?
AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) is the process of automating the tasks involved in the creation of machine learning models. It aims to make machine learning more accessible by allowing users, including those without deep expertise in machine learning, to build, optimize, and deploy models with minimal manual intervention.

### Key components of AutoML:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Automatically handles missing data, normalization, and feature engineering.
2. **Model Selection**: Evaluates multiple machine learning algorithms to find the best performing one.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Automates the tuning of model parameters for optimal performance.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Chooses the best model based on performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
5. **Ensembling**: Combines different models to create more accurate and robust predictions.
6. **Model Deployment**: Some AutoML platforms also support automated model deployment into production environments.

## Question: Why AutoML?
1. **Reduces Complexity**: Simplifies the machine learning process, making it accessible for non-experts.
1. **Speeds Up Development**: Automates time-consuming tasks like feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.
1. **Optimized Performance**: Automatically finds the best-performing models and configurations.
1. **Scalability**: AutoML tools are often capable of working with large datasets and scaling up for enterprise applications.

## Question: What are popular AutoML tools?
There are many AutoML tools, in python we call them libraries. These libraries simplify the process of building machine learning models by automating tasks like feature selection, model tuning, and pipeline creation.

These AutoML libraries and platforms cater to various use cases, from traditional machine learning to deep learning, cloud-based systems, and enterprise-level solutions. Choosing the right AutoML tool depends on the specific use case, scalability requirements, and cloud or framework integrations.

Popular AutoML libraries make it easier for developers and data scientists to automate the process of building, training, and optimizing machine learning models without deep expertise in ML. Here are some of the top AutoML libraries:
