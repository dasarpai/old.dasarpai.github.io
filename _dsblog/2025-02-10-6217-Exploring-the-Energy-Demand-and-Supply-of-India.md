# Exploring the Energy Demand and Supply of India 

## Introduction
When India talks about becoming a *Vishwa Guru* (World Leader), *Vishwa Mitra* (Friend of the World), the *Leader of the South*, or an *AI Superpower*, we must first understand our own electricity demand and supply. Without this understanding, these grand aspirations will remain mere words in the 21st century.  

I know energy experts are already discussing these issues, but those of us in AI development and semiconductor manufacturing also need to be on the same page. We cannot pursue narrow, isolated advancements without acknowledging our energy requirements. In this article, I aim to provoke my fellow data science community members in India to think critically about this issue—ask questions, analyze the situation, raise concerns in the right forums, and develop solutions.  

I am not from an energy background, but I have come to see this as a critical issue. With a growing population and rising aspirations, both of the existing and new generations, it is imperative that we engage in discussions on energy sustainability.  

Some time ago, I wondered why major companies were not establishing data centers in India and why I had to rely on web hosting or AI solution hosting on American, European, or Japanese servers—and in the future, possibly Chinese servers. As of today, security concerns prevent us from using Chinese infrastructure, but if security is the issue, then American and European platforms are not necessarily safer either. We have already seen the situation with Russia.  

This article does not aim to provide answers or solutions — it is meant to spark thought and discussion.
