# **The Road to Bharat LLMs Goes Via Sanskrit**

**The Case for Sanskrit as India’s AI Language**  

## **The National Language Debate and Its Impact on AI**  

Since India's independence, the debate over a national language has been intense. This issue becomes especially heated when considering the different regional perspectives, particularly in South India. For instance, Tamil Nadu politicians strongly believe that Tamil is their primary language, while Sanskrit is often seen as North Indian. At the time of independence, few would have predicted that 75 years later, we would be struggling to develop our own AI technology—partly due to not making Sanskrit the national language.  

## **Sanskrit: A Language Understood by All Indians**  

Don’t make the mistake of assuming that because only about 75,000 people speak Sanskrit today, it is irrelevant. If you think deeper, you’ll realize that only about 10% of Indians can understand, read, and write English fluently. However, there is hardly anyone in India who doesn't recognize Sanskrit in some form.  

If your cultural roots are tied to foreign religions, clothing, food, and history, you might question its relevance. But every Hindu, Sikh, Jain, and Buddhist—regardless of their sect or method of worship—even atheists, recognize the sounds of Sanskrit nouns and verbs. These sounds permeate our actions, institutions, places, festivals, and events.  

## **Language as an Art and Sanskrit as Its Mother**  

Not being able to draw or play the guitar doesn’t mean you can’t appreciate the beauty of art and music. Language is one of the arts of life, and Sanskrit, being the mother of hundreds of languages, is an ancient art form in itself.  

While it is important to respect regional aspirations and the promotion of local languages, we must also consider the immense intellectual richness of Sanskrit. It is not just a medium of communication; it is a repository of scientific, medical, technological, and Vedic wisdom.  

## **The Need to Rebuild a Modern Sanskrit Corpus**  

Regional languages like Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati, and Marathi are relatively young, ranging from 500 to 1,500 years old. In contrast, Sanskrit, according to historical records, is more than 6,000 years old. Some even claim it could be much older, but that debate is beyond the scope of this article.  

From philosophy to physics, biology to medical sciences, astronomy to astrology, metallurgy to chemistry, politics to administration, and poetry to literature—virtually all fields of knowledge in ancient Bharat were documented in Sanskrit. This vast corpus of knowledge is as old as the language itself.  

However, over the past 300 to 400 years, as modern science and technology developed, English became the dominant language of global discourse. During this time, India's contribution to scientific advancements has been minimal or has been made by Indians who were proficient in English. Their work was published in English, not Sanskrit, leaving our ancient corpus stagnant and disconnected from modern developments. In ChatGPT terms, we can say our **knowledge model was frozen around 300-400 years ago**.  

## **What Needs to Be Translated into Sanskrit?**  

While there are translations of some academic texts into regional languages, they are insufficient and lack the depth needed for scientific and technological progress. If Indian scholars and research institutions focus on translating major scientific, medical, engineering, political, and administrative texts into Sanskrit, we can build a **modern corpus** that will be invaluable for AI-driven advancements.  

### **Proposed Areas for Translation into Sanskrit:**  

- **All works from Indian government institutions** (national, state, and city). At the very least, content already available in digital format should be translated. Over time, as older works are digitized, they too can be translated.  
- **All state and parliamentary debates.**  
- **All scientific and technological works from the past 400 years.**  

### **Additional Areas to Strengthen the Sanskrit Corpus:**  

- **All judicial records and judgments** from the Supreme Court, High Courts, and lower courts. This would create a legal corpus in Sanskrit, aiding in AI-driven legal research and automation.  
- **Key Indian philosophical and intellectual works** from Vedanta, Nyaya, Buddhism, and Jainism. These should be digitized and available in **plain text format, not just scanned PDFs**.  
- **All medical and Ayurveda texts**, including modern medical research conducted in India, to create a Sanskrit-based biomedical corpus.  
- **Official speeches, policies, and reports** from key Indian leaders, policymakers, and institutions to build a linguistic dataset for governance and AI applications.  
- **Popular science and technology literature** from Indian authors in any Indian language.  

## **How Can We Achieve This?**  

We can leverage AI to accelerate this task, but since AI is not yet proficient in Sanskrit, 
- We must **hire scholars from temples and universities** for translation. They should be paid well, rather than being offered a mere ₹1000 dakshina. 
- Indian MNCs and government must allocate a dedicated budget for building this Sanskrit corpus
- This Sanskrit corpus should be freely accessible to all creators from Bharat.  
- Indian government must provide **free GPU compute** to our researchers
- Indian government should create a system of  relieving our people from the burden of publishing in international journals. This is a significant challenge for Indian intellectuals, as our cultural and value system differs greatly from the Western academic model. It is not that we donot have talent but we don't have time, money, connect and resources to compete with western research eco-system and we need help from our government and universities regarding this. Otherwise the pace of doing good work and publishing those will not pick up.

## **The Shift from a Free Knowledge Culture to a Commercialized One**  

India has historically considered **knowledge, shelter, food, and healthcare as fundamental human rights**.  

- Brahmins imparted knowledge without charging fees.  
- Villages had **Panchayat Ghars and temples** to shelter travelers.  
- It was the **community’s duty** to ensure that no one went hungry.  
- Vaidyas (traditional doctors) treated people **without seeking payment**.  

However, in today’s world, these four essentials—education, shelter, food, and healthcare—have become the most expensive commodities, and **India is no exception**.  

Despite this shift, the ethos of providing these necessities freely is still embedded in our DNA. Our language reflects this mindset through countless colloquial proverbs. Even today, we say, **"Knowledge is free"** (*free mein gyaan milta hai*), echoing our ancestral values.  

## **The Role of Sanskrit in AI and Technological Development**  

Sanskrit, by its very nature, is a **mathematical language**. If we build AI models using this corpus, they will be significantly more **efficient, accurate, and energy-conscious**. They will require **less memory and less expensive hardware** to run.  

Speaking from **personal experience in both Sanskrit and AI model-building**, I strongly believe that this is a direction Indian institutions must pursue **within the next 1 to 2 years**.  

These models would not only **solve India’s local problems** but also **address global challenges** more effectively. This is the right time for our **tech companies, government institutions, universities, temples, Sanskrit NGOs, and enthusiasts** to come together and develop an **Indian LLM (Language Model)** that serves Bharat.  

## **Wrong Comparision of Sanskrit will hurt Bharat's Interest**

Sanskrit is a language that cannot be fairly or fully understood by simply comparing it to Greek, Latin, or Hebrew. While drawing parallels between languages can sometimes provide interesting insights, it is crucial to recognize that each language evolves within its unique cultural, historical, and intellectual framework. Sanskrit, in particular, stands apart due to its distinctive journey and the rich tapestry of traditions, philosophies, and scientific insights it carries. Here are several reasons why such comparisons are not only inadequate but potentially harmful to Bharat's interests:

- **Distinct Evolutionary Trajectories:**  
  Western languages like Greek and Latin have followed evolutionary paths deeply intertwined with the cultural and societal shifts in Europe. In contrast, Sanskrit developed in a unique milieu, reflecting indigenous struggles, diverse philosophical inquiries, and societal complexities unique to Bharat. This divergence means that Sanskrit cannot be reduced to a mere parallel of these Western languages.

- **Misinterpretation and Elitism:**  
  Historically, certain narratives have attempted to pigeonhole Sanskrit as the exclusive language of an elite class—primarily the language of Brahmins—thereby marginalizing its broader contributions. This narrow view overlooks the vast reservoir of scientific, literary, and philosophical traditions embedded in Sanskrit texts. Discarding these contributions is akin to throwing away a precious resource along with its container.

- **Modern Implications of Language Choice:**  
  Today’s globalized world has largely adopted English, which, while using it as base language for AI, also brings challenges such as increased hardware and computing costs, and environmental concerns like global warming. Relying solely on English may not serve Bharat’s long-term cultural and scientific interests, whereas embracing Sanskrit can offer a sustainable alternative that honors our historical legacy.

- **Unique Cognitive Framework and Precision:**  
  Sanskrit’s highly systematic grammar and logical structure have been admired for centuries and have influenced modern linguistic and computational theories. Its precision makes it not only an excellent medium for literary expression but also a language that can contribute to modern fields like artificial intelligence and logic, which is not the case of European langauages.

- **Integration of Science and Spirituality:**  
  Unlike many Western languages that often separate scientific inquiry from spiritual or philosophical thought, Sanskrit integrates both. This holistic approach provides a unique perspective on problem-solving and innovation—an approach that could be invaluable in today’s multidisciplinary scientific environment.

- **Preservation of Indigenous Knowledge:**  
  Sanskrit is a repository of centuries-old wisdom in various domains including medicine, astronomy, mathematics, and architecture. Disregarding its potential by comparing it inadequately to other ancient languages risks sidelining a vast body of indigenous knowledge that could offer fresh insights into modern challenges.

- **Reinforcing National Identity:**  
  Embracing the unique qualities of Sanskrit strengthens Bharat’s cultural identity and pride. Comparisons with foreign languages can inadvertently contribute to a sense of cultural inferiority, undermining the value of our own rich intellectual heritage in a global context.

- **Countering Neocolonial Narratives:**  
  Comparing Sanskrit to languages such as Greek, Latin, or Hebrew often reinforces narratives that favor Western cultural lobby within Bharat and in the other part of the world. Recognizing Sanskrit’s distinct identity and contributions is essential in resisting these neocolonial perspectives and in asserting the value of Bharat’s own intellectual traditions.



## **Why No Western or Chinese LLM Can Solve Our Problems**  

India has millions of manuscripts, spanning **billions of pages**. However, most are in manuscript form (**Pandulipis**) or **scanned PDFs**, which are difficult to process. Even copying text from these PDFs into Notepad often results in **corrupted characters**—a problem that does not exist in English texts but significantly **hinders** the development of an **Indian AI model**.  

Take the **Bhagavad Gita**, for example—one of the most well-known works of Indian literature. It consists of just **700 verses**, yet even with this limited content, today’s **LLMs and deep learning models fail to provide accurate question-answering**. I have personally tested this with **ChatGPT and other deep learning models**, and the results were far from satisfactory.  

This demonstrates the **urgent need** for a **Bharat-centric AI model**, trained in Sanskrit, that can **unlock the vast knowledge of our civilization** and make it relevant for the modern world.  

# My Experiments with Reasoning Models 
My experiments with Deepseek R1 and ChatGPT Reason Model are detailed below. Anyone who knows Sanskrit and has read and understood the Bhagavad Gita will realize how poor the results are compared to any 1,400-line text in English.

## ChatGPT Reasoning Model 
### Me 
In Bhagwat Gita Arjuna asked many questions to Lord Shrikrishna. Can you give me list of all the questions or doubts which Arjuna asked or had. You need to tell me this with Sloka number and sloka should be devanagri script. Meaning of the sloka should be in english.

### Thinking 
Could you please clarify a few points before I proceed?

Scope of “Questions or Doubts”:
The dialogue in the Bhagavad Gita contains many statements and implicit doubts by Arjuna. Would you like:

Every instance where Arjuna poses an interrogative or expresses a doubt, or
Only the major, clearly identifiable questions/doubts (for example, his request to see Krishna’s universal form in Chapter 11, etc.)?
Textual Reference:
Which version or standard edition of the Bhagavad Gita should I use for the sloka numbering? (For instance, the Gita Press edition is commonly referenced.)

Once I have these details, I’ll be able to compile the list with each sloka in Devanagari along with its English meaning.

### Me 
I want all the questions from all the chapters. You can use Gita Press.

### Thinking 
This is a very extensive task because the Gita (in the Gita Press edition) contains many verses where Arjuna either directly asks a question or expresses a doubt. To make sure I compile exactly what you need, could you please clarify a couple of points?

1. **Definition of “Questions”:**  
   Would you like me to include only those verses where Arjuna uses an interrogative form (i.e. direct questions), or would you like every verse in which he expresses any doubt, confusion, or inquiry—even if it isn’t phrased strictly as a question?

2. **Output Format and Length:**  
   The complete list (with Devanagari text, verse number, and English translation) across all 18 chapters is quite lengthy. Would you like the full compilation in one message, or should I break it down chapter by chapter?

Once I have these details, I can proceed with the compilation.

### Me 
I need every sloka where Arjuna has doubt including the interrogation. Bhagwat Gita has only 700 Slokas that is not too much. If you want you can chapter wise but that would be too trivial because some chapters will have only one question. Therefore I wanted chapter number along sloka number in chapter.slokanum format.

### Thinking 
This is a very extensive compilation—in the standard Gita Press text, Arjuna’s doubts and questions (i.e. all verses beginning with “अर्जुन उवाच”) amount to roughly 67 verses spread across the 18 chapters. For each such verse I would need to provide:

• Its identifier in “chapter.slokanum” format (for example, 1.27, 1.28, …)  
• The full Devanagari text as printed by Gita Press  
• An English rendering of its meaning

Because of the sheer length of the complete list (which will run to several thousand words) and to ensure accuracy and clarity, I propose to deliver the compilation chapter‐by‐chapter in a series of responses. (In some chapters Arjuna’s contributions are extensive—as in Chapter 1—while in others there is only one or two utterances.) 

Would you like me to proceed in this multi‐part format (starting with Chapter 1) so that you can review and confirm each part as we go along?

### Me 
Proceed with chapter one. You should give complete sloka not partical. And meaning of full sloka. For the English meaning you can refer other english translation.

### Thining  
Below is one rendition of the complete Arjuna‐speech (the “Arjuna Vishāda‐Yoga”) in Chapter 1 of the Bhagavad Gita as printed by the Gita Press—with each verse numbered in “chapter.sloka” format (i.e. 1.28, 1.29, …, 1.47), followed by an English rendering of its meaning. (Please note that because of manuscript and editorial variations even within the Gita Press tradition, you may find slight differences in wording or verse‐numbering in different publications. The version below is one commonly accepted rendition.)

*Disclaimer:*  
The above rendering presents one complete version of Arjuna’s doubts and questions in Chapter 1 as per a commonly used Gita Press text. Because various editions sometimes differ slightly in wording or numbering, if you require a verbatim reproduction from a specific copy, please let me know so we can adjust accordingly.


## Deepseek V3

### Me
In Bhagwat Gita Arjuna asked many questions to Lord Shrikrishna. Can you give me list of all the questions or doubts which Arjuna asked or had. You need to tell me this with Sloka number and sloka should be devanagri script. Meaning of the sloka should be in hindi. You can use Gita press version for this. following this you can translate that sloka in English. I wanted complete sloka along with chapter.sloka format 

### DeepSeek:
The Bhagavad Gita, a 700-verse Hindu scripture, is part of the Indian epic Mahabharata. It is a dialogue between Prince Arjuna and the god Krishna, who serves as his charioteer. In this text, Arjuna expresses his doubts and questions about duty, righteousness, and the moral dilemmas he faces on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. Below, I will provide a list of some of the key questions Arjuna asks, along with the chapter and verse numbers, the slokas in Devanagari script, their meanings in Hindi, and their English translations.

'### 1. **Chapter 1, Verse 21-22**
   - **Devanagari:**
     ```
     अर्जुन उवाच |
     सेनयोरुभयोर्मध्ये रथं स्थापय मेऽच्युत |
     यावदेतान्निरीक्षेऽहं योद्धुकामानवस्थितान् || 21 ||
     कैर्मया सह योद्धव्यमस्मिन् रणसमुद्यमे || 22 ||
     ```
   - **Hindi Meaning:**
     अर्जुन ने कहा: हे अच्युत, मेरे रथ को दोनों सेनाओं के बीच में खड़ा करो, ताकि मैं युद्ध के लिए तैयार खड़े इन लोगों को देख सकूं। इस युद्ध में मुझे किन लोगों के साथ लड़ना है?
   - **English Translation:**
     Arjuna said: O Achyuta, please place my chariot between the two armies so that I may see those who stand here eager for battle. With whom must I fight in this combat?

'### 2. **Chapter 2, Verse 7**
   - **Devanagari:**
     ```
     कार्पण्यदोषोपहतस्वभावः पृच्छामि त्वां धर्मसम्मूढचेताः |
     यच्छ्रेयः स्यान्निश्चितं ब्रूहि तन्मे शिष्यस्तेऽहं शाधि मां त्वां प्रपन्नम् || 7 ||
     ```
   - **Hindi Meaning:**
     मेरा स्वभाव कायरता के दोष से ग्रस्त हो गया है और मेरी बुद्धि धर्म के विषय में मोहित हो गई है। मैं आपसे पूछता हूं कि मेरे लिए क्या श्रेयस्कर होगा, यह निश्चित करके बताइए। मैं आपका शिष्य हूं, आप मुझे शिक्षा दीजिए, मैं आपकी शरण में हूं।
   - **English Translation:**
     My nature is overcome by the taint of cowardice, and my mind is confused about duty. I ask you, tell me decisively what is good for me. I am your disciple. Instruct me, who has taken refuge in you.

'### 3. **Chapter 6, Verse 33-34**
   - **Devanagari:**
     ```
     अर्जुन उवाच |
     योऽयं योगस्त्वया प्रोक्तः साम्येन मधुसूदन |
     एतस्याहं न पश्यामि चञ्चलत्वात्स्थितिं स्थिराम् || 33 ||
     चञ्चलं हि मनः कृष्ण प्रमाथि बलवद्दृढम् |
     तस्याहं निग्रहं मन्ये वायोरिव सुदुष्करम् || 34 ||
     ```
   - **Hindi Meaning:**
     अर्जुन ने कहा: हे मधुसूदन, आपने जो योग समता के साथ कहा है, मैं उसकी स्थिर स्थिति को नहीं देख पाता, क्योंकि मन चंचल है। हे कृष्ण, मन चंचल, अशांत, बलवान और दृढ़ है, मुझे लगता है कि इसे वश में करना वायु को रोकने के समान कठिन है।
   - **English Translation:**
     Arjuna said: O Madhusudana, the system of yoga which you have summarized appears impractical and unendurable to me, for the mind is restless and unsteady. The mind is restless, turbulent, obstinate and very strong, O Krishna, and to subdue it, I think, is more difficult than controlling the wind.

'### 4. **Chapter 8, Verse 1**
   - **Devanagari:**
     ```
     अर्जुन उवाच |
     किं तद्ब्रह्म किमध्यात्मं किं कर्म पुरुषोत्तम |
     अधिभूतं च किं प्रोक्तमधिदैवं किमुच्यते || 1 ||
     ```
   - **Hindi Meaning:**
     अर्जुन ने कहा: हे पुरुषोत्तम, वह ब्रह्म क्या है? अध्यात्म क्या है? कर्म क्या है? अधिभूत क्या कहा जाता है और अधिदैव क्या कहा जाता है?
   - **English Translation:**
     Arjuna said: O Supreme Person, what is Brahman? What is the self? What is action? What is this material manifestation? And what are the demigods?

These are just a few examples of the questions Arjuna poses to Lord Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita. Each question reflects his deep confusion and desire for knowledge, leading to profound philosophical discussions that form the essence of the Gita. For a complete list of all questions, one would need to go through each chapter and identify the verses where Arjuna speaks, as his inquiries are spread throughout the text.

## Deepseek R1:

### Me
I think you missed many sloka. Let is do it chapter wise.

### Thinking:
Alright, the user mentioned that I missed many slokas in the previous response and wants a chapter-wise list of all the questions Arjuna asked in the Bhagavad Gita. Let me start by recalling the structure of the Gita. It has 18 chapters, and Arjuna's questions are spread across several of them, not just the first few.

First, I need to go through each chapter systematically. The user wants the slokas in Devanagari script, along with their Hindi meaning and English translation, using the Gita Press version. They also specified the format: chapter.sloka number, the sloka, then the meanings.

In the previous response, I covered chapters 1, 2, 6, and 8. But the user is right; there are more instances where Arjuna asks questions. Let me check each chapter one by one.

Starting with Chapter 1: The initial questions are in verses 21-22 and 28-46. Wait, in the first answer, I included 21-22 but not 28-46. That's a miss. Arjuna expresses his reluctance to fight, listing his reasons, which are more of statements but also imply doubts.

Chapter 2: Verse 7 is a direct question. Are there others in Chapter 2? Maybe not. Then Chapter 3: Verse 1-2, where Arjuna asks why Krishna is urging him to fight if knowledge is better than action. I should include that.

Chapter 5: Verse 1, Arjuna asks whether renunciation or action is better. That's another question.

Chapter 6: Verses 33-34, which I included, but also 37-39 where Arjuna asks about failed yogis. Missed those.

Chapter 7: Verse 16-17, but those might be statements. Wait, in 7.16, Arjuna asks about the four types of devotees. Need to check if that's a question.

Chapter 8: Verse 1, included. Also, 8.2 where he asks about Brahman, etc. But maybe that's part of the same question.

Chapter 12: Verse 1, where Arjuna asks about devotees who worship the formless versus those who worship the form. That's another key question.

Chapter 17: Verse 1, Arjuna asks about people who worship with faith but disregard scriptures. That's important.

I need to verify each chapter for any verses where Arjuna is speaking and posing a question. Some chapters might not have questions, like Chapter 4, 9, 10, 11 (though in 11, Arjuna asks to see Krishna's universal form, which is a request, not a question). Wait, in 11.3-4, Arjuna does ask to see the universal form. So that's a request phrased as a question.

Also, in Chapter 18, verse 1, Arjuna asks about sannyasa and tyaga, the difference between renunciation and relinquishment. That's another question.

So compiling all these, I need to list each chapter where Arjuna asks a question, provide the exact verses in Devanagari, then the Hindi and English translations. The user wants all questions, so even if a chapter has multiple questions, like Chapter 1, I need to list them all.

Let me structure this chapter-wise, starting from 1 to 18, and for each, extract the relevant verses where Arjuna poses a question or expresses doubt. This will ensure completeness. Also, check if the Gita Press edition's verse numbering aligns with standard versions to avoid discrepancies.

Now, translating the slokas accurately is crucial. Since the user mentioned using Gita Press, which is a trusted source, I should cross-verify the translations from that version. Also, ensuring the Devanagari script is correct without typos.

Finally, the user might be preparing for a study, a presentation, or personal understanding. Providing a comprehensive list will help them in their deeper exploration of the Gita. Making sure the answer is well-formatted, clear, and covers all chapters where Arjuna's questions appear.

```  
**Hindi Meaning:**  
हे जनार्दन! यदि आप ज्ञान को कर्म से श्रेष्ठ मानते हैं, तो मुझे भयानक युद्ध में क्यों झोंक रहे हैं? आप मेरी बुद्धि को भ्रमित कर रहे हैं। निश्चित रूप से बताएँ कि मेरे लिए क्या श्रेयस्कर है।
