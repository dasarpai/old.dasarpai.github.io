# How Many Types of Technologies?   

## Introduction   
Often we hear various jargon of different types of technologies and sometimes during the discussion, it becomes a mouthful of technologies to digest the meaning of these. Many times these technologies are overlapping each other but the speaker mentions that in a certain context. Today I thought let me list the possible technologies which we hear about very frequently. Nowadays AI balloon is flying everywhere and all over, it is impacting our society, business, government, social behavior, lifestyle, and whatnot. In light of this, we find many new technologies are popping up or modifying the way of doing existing businesses. In the interest of brevity, I am keeping a one-liner kind of definition. In the coming time, based on the need I will expand on each topic. Each technology mentioned below deserves a full-length article to understand the possibilities around that and its impact on our businesses, societies, etc.


There are various ways to classify different types of technologies, and the terminology may differ depending on the source or context. Here are some common types of technologies:

## Types of Technologies 

### Disruptive technologies: 
Disruptive technologies are innovations that disrupt existing markets, products, or services by creating new markets or significantly changing the value proposition of existing offerings. Examples of disruptive technologies include the personal computer, digital photography, and mobile phones.

### Transformative technologies: 
Transformative technologies are innovations that have the potential to transform society and change the way we live, work, and interact with each other. Examples of transformative technologies include artificial intelligence, blockchain, and 3D printing.

### Emerging technologies: 
Emerging technologies are innovations that are still in the early stages of development but have the potential to have a significant impact on society and the economy. In today's context examples of emerging technologies include nanotechnology, quantum computing, and gene editing.

### Enabling technologies: 
Enabling technologies are innovations that enable or support the development and implementation of other technologies or solutions. Examples of enabling technologies include cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), and wireless communication technologies.

### Core technologies: 
Core technologies are innovations that are essential to the development and functioning of a particular industry or field. Examples of core technologies include semiconductor technology in the electronics industry and biotechnology in the healthcare industry.

### Green technologies: 
Green technologies, also known as clean technologies, are innovations that aim to reduce the environmental impact of human activities and promote sustainability. Examples of green technologies include solar power, wind power, and electric vehicles.

### Information technologies: 
Information technologies (IT) are technologies that are used to process, store, and communicate information. Examples of IT include computer hardware and software, telecommunications networks, and the internet.

### Medical technologies: 
Medical technologies are innovations that are used to diagnose, treat, or prevent medical conditions. Examples of medical technologies include medical imaging equipment, implantable devices, and gene therapies.

### Space technologies: 
Space technologies are innovations that are used in the exploration and utilization of outer space. Examples of space technologies include spacecraft, satellites, and space probes.

### Social technologies:
