# Visualizing Transformers and Attention
This is the summary note from Grant Sanderson's talk at TNG Big Tech 2024. My earlir article on transformers can be found [here](/dsblog/transformers-demystified-a-step-by-step-guide)

## **Transformers and Their Flexibility**
- 📜 **Origin:** Introduced in 2017 in the "Attention is All You Need" paper, originally for machine translation.
- 🌍 **Applications Beyond Translation:** Used in transcription (e.g., Whisper), text-to-speech, and even image classification.
- 🤖 **Chatbot Models:** Focused on models trained to predict the next token in a sequence, generating text iteratively one token at a time.

---

## **Next Token Prediction and Creativity**
- 🔮 **Prediction Process:** Predicts probabilities for possible next tokens, selects one, and repeats the process.
- 🌡️ **Temperature Control:** Adjusting randomness in token selection affects creativity vs. predictability in outputs.

---

## **Tokens and Tokenization**
- 🧩 **What are Tokens?** Subdivisions of input data (words, subwords, punctuation, or image patches).
- 🔡 **Why Not Characters?** Using characters increases context size and computational complexity; tokens balance meaning and computational efficiency.
- 📖 **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE):** A common method for tokenization.

---

## **Embedding Tokens into Vectors**
- 📏 **Embedding:** Tokens are mapped to high-dimensional vectors representing their meaning.
- 🗺️ **Contextual Meaning:** Vectors evolve through the network to capture context, disambiguate meaning, and encode relationships.

---

## **The Attention Mechanism**
- 🔍 **Purpose:** Enables tokens to "attend" to others, updating their vectors based on relevance.
- 🔑 **Key Components:**
  - Query Matrix: Encodes what a token is "looking for."
  - Key Matrix: Encodes how a token responds to queries.
  - Value Matrix: Encodes information passed between tokens.
- 🧮 **Calculations:**
  - Dot Product: Measures alignment between keys and queries.
  - Softmax: Converts dot products into normalized weights for updates.
- ⛓️ **Masked Attention:** Ensures causality by blocking future tokens from influencing past ones.

---

## **Multi-Headed Attention**
- 💡 **Parallel Heads:** Multiple attention heads allow different types of relationships (e.g., grammar, semantic context) to be processed simultaneously.
- 🚀 **Efficiency on GPUs:** Designed to maximize parallelization for faster computation.

---

## **Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs)**
- 🤔 **Role in Transformers:**
  - Add capacity for general knowledge and non-contextual reasoning.
  - Store facts learned during training, e.g., associations like "Michael Jordan plays basketball."
- 🔢 **Parameters:** MLPs hold the majority of the model’s parameters.

---

## **Training Transformers**
- 📚 **Learning Framework:**
  - Models are trained on vast datasets using next-token prediction, requiring no manual labels.
  - **Cost Function:** Measures prediction accuracy using negative log probabilities, guiding parameter updates.
- 🏔️ **Optimization:** Gradient descent navigates a high-dimensional cost surface to minimize error.
- 🌐 **Pretraining:** Allows large-scale unsupervised learning before fine-tuning with human feedback.

---

## **Embedding Space and High Dimensions**
- 🔄 **Semantic Clusters:** Similar words cluster together; directions in the space encode relationships (e.g., gender: King - Male + Female = Queen).
- 🌌 **High Dimensionality:** Embedding spaces have thousands of dimensions, enabling distinct representations of complex concepts.
- 📈 **Scaling Efficiency:** High-dimensional spaces allow exponentially more "almost orthogonal" directions for encoding meanings.

---

## **Practical Applications**
- ✍️ **Language Models:** Effective for chatbots, summarization, and more due to their generality and parallel processing.
- 🖼️ **Multimodal Models:** Transformers can integrate text, images, and sound by treating all as tokens in a unified framework.

---

## **Challenges and Limitations**
- 📏 **Context Size Limitations:** Attention grows quadratically with context size, requiring optimization for large contexts.
- ♻️ **Inference Redundancy:** Token-by-token generation can involve redundant computations; caching mitigates this at inference time.

---

## **Engineering and Design**
- 🛠️ **Hardware Optimization:** Transformers are designed to exploit GPUs' parallelism for efficient matrix multiplication.
- 🔗 **Residual Connections:** Baked into the architecture to enhance stability and ease of training.

---

## **The Power of Scale**
- 📈 **Scaling Laws:** Larger models and more data improve performance, often qualitatively.
- 🔄 **Self-Supervised Pretraining:** Enables training on vast unlabeled datasets before fine-tuning.

## **BPE (Byte Pair Encoding)** 
BPE is a widely used tokenization method in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. It is designed to balance between breaking text into characters and full words by representing text as a sequence of subword units. This approach helps models handle rare and unseen words effectively while keeping the vocabulary size manageable.

---

### **How BPE Works:**
1. **Start with Characters:**
   - Initially, every character in the text is treated as a separate token.

2. **Merge Frequent Pairs:**
   - BPE repeatedly identifies the most frequent pair of adjacent tokens in the training corpus and merges them into a single token. This process is iteratively applied.
   - For example:
     - Input: `low`, `lower`, `lowest`
     - Output Vocabulary: {low_, e, r, s, t}

3. **Build Vocabulary:**
   - The merging process stops after a predefined number of merges, resulting in a vocabulary of subwords, characters, and some common full words.
