# Exploring Reasoning Models in AI Marketplace - Feb'2025

##  **What Makes a Model a "Reasoning Model"?**
The term "reasoning model" is not strictly defined but generally refers to models that **explicitly demonstrate structured problem-solving abilities**, such as:
- **Logical inference** (deductive/inductive reasoning)
- **Multi-step problem-solving** (e.g., math, coding, puzzles)
- **Common-sense reasoning** (understanding implicit context)
- **Causal reasoning** (connecting causes and effects).

Modern models achieve this through architectural innovations (e.g., chain-of-thought prompting, sparse attention) and training on datasets enriched with reasoning tasks (e.g., math problems, logic puzzles).

## **Can we say earlier models like Phi-2, Mistral, and Llama 2 are Called "Reasoning Models"**
These models are **explicitly optimized** for reasoning tasks through:
- **Training Data**: Curated datasets with math, code, and logic problems.
- **Architecture**: Techniques like sparse attention (Mistral) or small-but-efficient designs (Phi-2).
- **Fine-Tuning**: Instruction-tuning to follow complex, multi-step prompts.

**Examples of Their Reasoning Capabilities**
- **Phi-2** (Microsoft):    Trained on synthetic textbooks and logic puzzles, excelling at common-sense reasoning (e.g., *"If Alice has 3 apples and gives 2 to Bob, how many does she have?"*).

- **Mistral 7B**:    Uses grouped-query attention for efficient long-context reasoning, outperforming larger models on logic puzzles and code generation.

- **Llama 2** (Meta):   Fine-tuned on coding and math datasets (e.g., CodeLlama variant), enabling multi-step problem-solving in domains like arithmetic or chemistry.

### **Was GPT-1 the "Reasoning Model"?**
**GPT-1** (2018) was groundbreaking as an early transformer-based language model, but it lacked **explicit reasoning capabilities**:
- **Limitations**: Struggled with multi-step logic (e.g., arithmetic beyond simple addition).  They have limited common-sense understanding (e.g., *"John put a glass on the edge of a table. It fell. Why?"*).  
- **Role in Evolution**:    GPT-1’s transformer architecture became the foundation for later reasoning-focused models, but it wasn’t optimized for structured reasoning tasks.

The term "reasoning model" gained traction with models like **GPT-3** (2020), which showed emergent reasoning abilities, and **GPT-4**/**Claude 3**, which integrated explicit reasoning frameworks (e.g., tree-of-thought prompting).

## **Why there is a Confusion in the market and people think GPT o1 is the first reasoning model?**
- **Ambiguity in Terminology**: "Reasoning" is a spectrum. Even early models like GPT-1 could answer simple questions, but modern models handle *structured, multi-step* reasoning.  
- **Evolution of Capabilities**: As models scaled, reasoning emerged as a byproduct of training on diverse data (e.g., GPT-3), but newer models are **deliberately engineered** for reasoning.  
- Recent models are using **Chain of Thought, Tree of Thoughts** to plan and execute reasoning processes, they are taking time to think and do the work and showing the progress on the screen. This is giving impression that earlier models were not reasoning.




## Language Models vs. Reasoning Models
Language models are AI systems trained to predict the next token (word, subword, or character) in a sequence. They learn statistical patterns from vast text corpora. Model like GPT-1, BERT, Llama 2, Falcon-180B can do several language task like translation, text generation, sentiment analysis, summarization, generation, NER and question-answering. But they lack the capability to solve complex, multi-step problems like arithmetic or logic.

Reasoning models are language models explicitly optimized to perform structured problem-solving, logical inference, or causal analysis. They bridge the gap between pattern recognition and human-like deduction. Techniques like Sparse attention (Mistral), chain-of-thought prompting (GPT-4) helps in reasoning.

The next step of these two development is Agentic systems. Agentic systems are AI frameworks that autonomously plan, act, and iteratively improve using language or reasoning models as a core component. They integrate tools (APIs, calculators, temperature, or thousands of other tools can be written and integrated by Agentic systems), memory (ability to remember previous conversations), and feedback loops (ability to improve from previous feedbacks).

## Proprietary and Opensource Modern Reasoning Models

Modern reasoning models have significantly advanced AI's ability to perform logical and structured problem-solving.
