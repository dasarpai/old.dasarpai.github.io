### Survey Note: Comprehensive Analysis of Reasoning Models in the AI Marketplace

Reasoning models represent a significant advancement in AI, designed to mimic human reasoning for complex problem-solving and decision-making. These models, often built on large language models (LLMs), are trained to break down problems into steps, using techniques like chain of thought (CoT) reasoning, and are increasingly available in the AI marketplace through APIs, cloud platforms, and open-source repositories. This note provides a detailed survey of the current landscape as of February 27, 2025, covering major proprietary models, open-source options, and the broader context of their development and availability.

## Background and Definition
Reasoning models are a subset of LLMs specifically engineered to handle complex tasks such as mathematics, coding, science, and strategic decision-making. Unlike general-purpose LLMs that generate quick responses, reasoning models explicitly show their thought process, often through decomposition, ideation, validation, and execution phases. This shift from "thinking fast" to "thinking slow" has been driven by the need for AI to tackle real-world complexity, as highlighted in recent industry analyses ([What is Reasoning in AI? Types and Applications in 2025](https://aisera.com/blog/ai-reasoning/)).

The AI marketplace, encompassing platforms like Hugging Face, Azure AI Foundry, Google Cloud, and company APIs, has seen a surge in these models, reflecting a trend toward inference compute, where additional processing time enhances reliability and sensibility of outputs. This trend coincides with the growing demand for AI in enterprise applications, where accuracy and explainability are critical.
