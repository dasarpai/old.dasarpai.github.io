## NVIDIA Timeline
NVIDIA Corporation has an illustrious history since its founding in 1993. It started as a graphics processing pioneer and has grown into a global leader in AI, gaming, data center technologies, and more. Here's a timeline of key milestones and activities:

---

### **1993-1999: Founding and Early Innovations**
- **1993:** NVIDIA was founded by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem in Santa Clara, California, with a focus on graphics processing.
- **1995:** Launched the **NV1**, the company’s first graphics chip, which supported both 2D and 3D graphics.
- **1999:** Introduced the **GeForce 256**, the world's first GPU, which revolutionized graphics processing by offloading 3D rendering tasks from the CPU.

---

### **2000-2009: Expanding into Gaming and Professional Graphics**
- **2000:** NVIDIA acquired 3dfx, a leading graphics company, consolidating its dominance in the GPU market.
- **2002:** Released the **GeForce4** series, establishing itself as a leader in gaming GPUs.
- **2004:** Entered the professional graphics market with the **Quadro FX** series.
- **2006:** Launched **CUDA**, a parallel computing platform enabling developers to use NVIDIA GPUs for general-purpose computing.
- **2008:** Introduced the **Tesla series**, targeting high-performance computing (HPC) and AI research.

#### Fun Fact:

Tesla, Inc. (originally Tesla Motors), founded in 2003, is named after Nikola Tesla as well, acknowledging his contributions to electrical systems. Interestingly, NVIDIA and Tesla, Inc. later had a professional relationship. NVIDIA GPUs were used in Tesla's early Autopilot systems, although Tesla later transitioned to building its own custom AI chips.

NVIDIA Tesla series and Tesla, Inc. remain separate entities with no direct affiliation.

Tesla Motors (now Tesla, Inc.) was founded by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning in July 2003. Elon Musk joined Tesla as the lead investor in February 2004 in its Series A funding round, investing $6.5 million and becoming the Chairman of the Board. This was when Musk effectively started shaping the company's vision and direction. In 2008, Elon Musk became the CEO and Product Architect of Tesla after internal conflicts led to Martin Eberhard leaving the company.
