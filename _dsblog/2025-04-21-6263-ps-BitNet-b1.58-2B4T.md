# BitNet b1.58-2B4T by Microsoft

## Approach

Based on the information in the sources, the development of BitNet b1.58 2B4T involved several key techniques, which can be broken down step by step in terms of architecture, training, and inference:

### **1. Architecture Modifications Based on the Transformer Model:**
*   BitNet b1.58 2B4T's architecture is derived from the standard **Transformer model**.
*   The core innovation lies in replacing standard full-precision linear layers with **custom BitLinear layers**.

### **2. BitLinear Layer Implementation:**
*   **Weight Quantization**: During the forward pass, model weights are **quantized to 1.58 bits** using an **absolute mean (absmean) quantization scheme**, mapping weights to ternary values {-1, 0, +1}.
*   **Activation Quantization**: Activations flowing through the linear projection are **quantized to 8-bit integers** using an **absolute maximum (absmax) quantization strategy**, applied per-token.
*   **Normalization**: **Subln normalization** was incorporated to enhance training stability, which is particularly beneficial in quantized training.

### **3. Integration of Established LLM Techniques:**
*   **Activation Function (FFN)**: Instead of SwiGLU, the model uses **squared ReLU (ReLU2)** within the feed-forward network sub-layers, motivated by its potential to improve sparsity and computational characteristics in the 1-bit context.
*   **Positional Embeddings**: **Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE)** are used to inject positional information, a standard practice in modern LLMs.
*   **Bias Removal**: All **bias terms are removed** from the linear layers and normalization layers throughout the network to reduce parameter count and potentially simplify quantization.
*   **Tokenization**: The **tokenizer developed for LLaMA 3** is adopted, which implements a byte-level Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) scheme with a vocabulary size of 128,256 tokens.

### **4. Three-Phase Training Process:**
*   The training involved three distinct phases: **large-scale pre-training**, followed by **supervised fine-tuning (SFT)**, and then **direct preference optimization (DPO)**.

### **5. Pre-training:**
*   **General Training Strategies**: Adapted from established LLM practices, with specific adjustments for the 1-bit architecture.
*   **Learning Rate Schedule**: A **two-stage learning rate schedule** was employed.
    *   **Stage 1 (High Learning Rate)**: A standard **cosine decay schedule** starting with a relatively high peak learning rate, leveraging the observed greater training stability of 1-bit models.
    *   **Stage 2 (Cooldown)**: Approximately midway through training, the learning rate was **abruptly decayed** and subsequently maintained via a **cosine schedule with a significantly lower peak value** to refine representations on higher-quality data.
*   **Weight Decay Schedule**: A **two-stage weight decay strategy** was implemented.
    *   **Stage 1**: Weight decay followed a **cosine schedule**, reaching a peak value of 0.1 to help prevent overfitting during the initial high-learning-rate phase.
    *   **Stage 2**: Weight decay was **effectively disabled (set to zero)** to allow the model parameters to settle into finer-grained optima guided by the lower learning rate and curated data.
*   **Pre-training Data**: A mixture of **publicly available text and code datasets**, including DCLM and FineWeb-EDU, along with **synthetically generated mathematical data** to enhance reasoning abilities. Data presentation aligned with the two-stage training, with general web data in Stage 1 and higher-quality curated datasets in Stage 2.

### **6. Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT):**
*   **SFT Data**: A diverse collection of **publicly available instruction-following and conversational datasets**, including WildChat, LMSYS-Chat-1M, WizardLM Evol-Instruct, and SlimOrca, supplemented with **synthetic datasets** generated using methodologies like GLAN and MathScale to bolster specific capabilities.
*   **Chat Template**: A specific **chat template structure** was used for conversational tasks.
*   **Optimization Details**:
    *   **Loss Aggregation**: **Summation** of the cross-entropy loss across tokens within a batch was used instead of averaging, which empirically improved convergence and final performance.
    *   **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Careful tuning of the **learning rate** (relatively larger than typical for full-precision models) and the **number of training epochs** (extended duration required for optimal convergence) was performed.

### **7. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO):**
*   **Training Data**: A preference dataset constructed from a combination of **publicly available resources**, specifically UltraFeedback and MagPie.
*   **Training Details**: Conducted for **2 epochs** with a **learning rate of 2× 10−7** and a **DPO beta parameter of 0.1**. **Optimized kernels from the Liger Kernel library** were integrated to enhance training efficiency.

### **8. Inference Implementation:**
*   Dedicated inference libraries were developed and open-sourced for both **GPU and CPU platforms** to handle the unique W1.58A8 quantization scheme.

### **9. GPU Inference:**
*   A **custom CUDA kernel** was specifically designed for the W1.58A8 matrix multiplication since standard libraries lack optimized kernels for this mixed-precision, low-bit format.
*   The kernel employs a **'pack-store-load-unpack-compute' strategy** for weights. Four ternary weight values are packed into a single 8-bit integer for storage in HBM. During computation, they are loaded into faster SRAM, unpacked, and then used for matrix multiplication with 8-bit activations.

### **10. CPU Inference:**
*   The **bitnet.cpp** library was developed as an official reference implementation for CPU inference of 1-bit LLMs, including BitNet b1.58.
*   **Optimized kernels tailored for standard CPU architectures** were implemented to work efficiently with the model's quantization scheme, ensuring numerical accuracy relative to the training procedure (lossless inference).

These steps outline the core techniques employed in the research and development of BitNet b1.58 2B4T.

## **What is Weight Quantization?**

**Weight quantization** is a technique used to reduce the size and computational cost of a neural network by representing weights with fewer bits.

In this case:
- **Weights are quantized to 1.58 bits** → that's an average bit-per-weight, which implies ternary quantization (3 possible values).
- The quantized values are `{ -1, 0, +1 }`.
- The method used is **absolute mean (absmean) quantization**.

---

### 🔍 **What's "absmean" quantization?**

This scheme sets thresholds based on the **mean of the absolute values** of the weights in a layer or tensor.

Here's the general process:
1. Calculate `T = mean(abs(weights))` (the absmean threshold).
2. For each weight `w`:
   - If `w > T`, set it to `+1`.
   - If `w < -T`, set it to `-1`.
   - If `-T ≤ w ≤ T`, set it to `0`.

---

### 🧮 **Example: Quantizing a Tensor**

Let's say you have a simple weight tensor:

```python
weights = [-2.0, -0.5, 0.0, 0.3, 1.2, 2.5]
```

**Step 1: Compute absmean**  
```python
absmean = mean(abs(weights)) = mean([2.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.3, 1.2, 2.5]) = 6.5 / 6 ≈ 1.083
```

**Step 2: Apply absmean quantization**  
```python
quantized_weights = []
for w in weights:
    if w > 1.083:
        quantized_weights.append(+1)
    elif w < -1.083:
        quantized_weights.append(-1)
    else:
        quantized_weights.append(0)
```

**Output:**  
```python
weights =     [-2.0, -0.5, 0.0, 0.3, 1.2, 2.5]
quantized =   [ -1 ,   0 ,  0 ,  0 ,  1 ,  1 ]
```

Now the weights are ternary: `{-1, 0, +1}` — with each weight approximated using only **log₂(3) ≈ 1.58 bits**.
Why log2 and not lo10? Because our digital system uses 0,1. Why 3 and not 5 or 7? Because we are using 3 values (-1,0,1).

### ✅ **Why is this useful?**

- **Memory savings** — from 32-bit float to ~1.58 bits.
- **Faster inference** — multiply becomes add/subtract or skip (for zero).
- **Sparsity** — `0` weights can be skipped during computation.

## What is SubLN (Sub-layer Normalization)

**SubLN (Sublayer Normalization)** is a variant of normalization applied **within sublayers** of a neural network (like Transformer layers), **after the residual connection and before the activation function**. It stabilizes the learning process.

It Reduces quantization noise, Stabilizes training, Improves convergence, Applies after residual, Common in Transformers 

It’s similar in spirit to LayerNorm but usually **simpler and more efficient**, especially helpful for **low-precision training**, like in quantized models.

---

### 🧠 Why is this important in **Quantized Training**?

Quantized weights (e.g., `{ -1, 0, +1 }`) lead to:
- **Lower dynamic range**
- **Noisy gradients**
- **Instability during training**

SubLN:
- **Reduces activation noise** caused by weight quantization
- **Normalizes the outputs of each sublayer**, which can vary wildly in quantized settings
- Improves **gradient flow and convergence**

---

### 📌 Where is SubLN applied?

In a Transformer-style model:

```text
       Input
         |
     +---+---+
     |       |
     | Self-Attn
     |       |
     +---+---+
         |
      Add + SubLN
         |
     +---+---+
     |       |
     |  MLP
     |       |
     +---+---+
         |
      Add + SubLN
         |
      Output
```

Each block has:
- **Residual Add**
- **SubLN normalization**
- **Activation/next layer**

---

### 🧮 Example (PyTorch-style pseudocode)

Let’s say you’re building a Transformer sublayer:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SubLNTransformerBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model):
        super().__init__()
        self.self_attn = nn.MultiheadAttention(d_model, num_heads=8)
        self.norm1 = nn.LayerNorm(d_model, elementwise_affine=True)
        self.ffn = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(d_model, d_model * 4),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(d_model * 4, d_model),
        )
        self.norm2 = nn.LayerNorm(d_model, elementwise_affine=True)

    def forward(self, x):
        # Self-attention sublayer
        attn_out, _ = self.self_attn(x, x, x)
        x = x + attn_out                  # Residual Add
        x = self.norm1(x)                 # SubLN after residual

        # Feedforward sublayer
        ffn_out = self.ffn(x)
        x = x + ffn_out                   # Residual Add
        x = self.norm2(x)                 # SubLN after residual
        return x
```

This is essentially implementing **SubLN** — even though `LayerNorm` is used, the key is **where** it's applied (after residual, before activation or next sublayer).
