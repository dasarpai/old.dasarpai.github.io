# Hunyuan3D 2.0: High-Resolution Textured 3D Asset Generation



Here is a detailed briefing document reviewing the main themes and most important ideas from the paper on Hunyuan3D 2.0:

## Introduction 

**Briefing Document:** Hunyuan3D 2.0

**Source:** [Hunyuan3D 2.0](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12202) Hunyuan3D 2.0: Scaling Diffusion Models for High Resolution Textured 3D Assets Generation

**Purpose:** This document summarizes the key aspects of the Hunyuan3D 2.0 system, a large-scale 3D synthesis system for generating high-resolution textured 3D assets.

**Authors:** Hunyuan3D Team (Multiple contributors listed in the source).

**Publication Date:** Appears to be January 2025, based on the arXiv identifier (2501.12202).

**Core Mission:** The Hunyuan3D Team's mission statement is "Living out everyone’s imagination on creating and manipulating 3D assets."

## Key Themes and Concepts:

- Large-Scale 3D Synthesis System: Hunyuan3D 2.0 is presented as a comprehensive system for creating 3D assets. It is designed for large-scale applications and focuses on generating high-resolution, textured assets.

- Two Foundation Components: The system is built upon two main models:

	- Hunyuan3D-DiT (Shape Generation Model): This model is responsible for generating the geometry (bare mesh) of a 3D asset based on a given condition image. It utilizes a scalable flow-based diffusion transformer architecture.

	- Hunyuan3D-Paint (Texture Synthesis Model): This model focuses on creating high-resolution and vibrant texture maps for either generated or existing meshes. It leverages geometric and diffusion priors.

- Hunyuan3D-Studio (Production Platform): Beyond the core models, the system includes a user-friendly platform called Hunyuan3D-Studio. This platform aims to simplify the 3D asset creation process and allows users to manipulate and animate their meshes.

- Performance and Comparison: The authors claim that Hunyuan3D 2.0 surpasses previous state-of-the-art models (both open-source and closed-source) in key areas such as geometry details, condition alignment, and texture quality. Numerical comparisons using various metrics (FIDCLIP, CMMD, CLIP-score, LPIPS for texture; V-IoU, S-IoU, ULIP-I, Uni3D-I, ULIP-T, Uni3D-T for shape) are presented to support these claims.

- Open-Source Release: A significant aspect of the project is the public release of Hunyuan3D 2.0, including the code and pre-trained weights, to contribute to the open-source 3D community. The GitHub repository is provided: https://github.com/Tencent/Hunyuan3D-2.

## Detailed Breakdown of Key Components and Ideas:

### Shape Generation (Hunyuan3D-DiT):

- Employs a latent diffusion model architecture, drawing inspiration from its success in image and video generation.

- Consists of an autoencoder (Hunyuan3D-ShapeVAE) to compress 3D mesh shapes into a sequence of continuous tokens.

- Uses a flow-based diffusion model (Hunyuan3D-DiT) trained in the latent space to predict object tokens from an input image.

- The architecture utilizes both double- and single-stream transformer blocks to enhance interaction between shape and image modalities (Figure 4).

- A key innovation in the ShapeVAE is the use of importance sampling alongside uniform sampling to capture high-frequency details like edges and corners from the input mesh surface (Figure 3).

- The decoder reconstructs the 3D shape using a neural field and the marching cubes algorithm to produce a triangle mesh.

### Texture Map Synthesis (Hunyuan3D-Paint):

- Aims to generate high-resolution and seamless texture maps for a given mesh and image prompt.

- Requires the texture map to align with the prompt, be multi-view consistent, and harmonize with the mesh.

- Follows a three-stage framework: pre-processing, multi-view image synthesis, and texture baking. (Figure 5)

- Pre-processing: Includes an Image Delighting Module to remove illumination and shadows from the input image, ensuring illumination-invariant texture synthesis. This is achieved by training on paired images rendered under HDRI environmental maps and even white light.

- View Selection Strategy: Employs a geometry-aware viewpoint selection strategy to efficiently generate texture with minimal viewpoints, aiming for maximum surface coverage. It starts with 4 orthogonal views and iteratively adds more using a greedy search (Algorithm 1).

- Multi-task Attention Mechanism: Introduces two additional attention modules (reference attention and multi-view attention) in parallel to the original self-attention within the diffusion model (Equation 4). \* Reference attention integrates the input reference image. \* Multi-view attention ensures consistency across generated views.

- Geometry and View Conditioning: Geometry conditions (canonical normal maps and canonical coordinate maps) are concatenated with noise and fed into the model. A learnable camera embedding is also used to provide viewpoint information.

- Texture Baking: Employs dense-view inference during the multi-view generation stage to reduce the need for inpainting holes caused by self-occlusion. A view dropout strategy during training helps the model generalize and support this dense inference.

## User-Centric Features:

- Hunyuan3D-Studio: Designed to be a versatile and user-friendly platform, accessible to both professionals and amateurs for manipulating and animating 3D assets.

- Sketch-to-3D Module: The system includes a module capable of generating detailed and realistic 3D assets from simple sketches, described as a "low-barrier creation platform for ordinary users."

- Low-polygon Stylization Module: A module to convert dense meshes into low-polygon meshes, crucial for many CG pipelines and reducing computational costs. This involves geometric editing and texture preservation.

## Evaluation and Results:

- The paper presents quantitative results showing Hunyuan3D 2.0's superior performance compared to baselines across various metrics.

- A user study is mentioned (Figure 10), suggesting evaluation of the generated assets by users based on criteria like overall quality and image following.

- Visual comparisons (Figure 11) highlight the model's ability to synthesize detailed geometry (surface bumps, intricate structures) and vivid, correct texture maps, even for complex actions.

## Key Strengths and Contributions:

- Comprehensive System: Combines shape and texture generation with a user-friendly platform.

- High-Resolution Output: Focuses on generating detailed and high-resolution assets.

- Improved Geometry and Texture Quality: Demonstrates superior performance through quantitative and visual evaluations.

- Novel Architectural Designs: Includes innovations like importance sampling in ShapeVAE and the multi-task attention mechanism in Hunyuan3D-Paint.

- Illumination-Invariant Texture: The image delighting module addresses a common challenge in texture generation.

- Dense-View Inference for Texture Baking: Reduces dependence on post-generation inpainting.

- Open-Source Contribution: Provides valuable resources to the 3D generation community.

- User Accessibility: Aims to make 3D asset creation more accessible through the Studio and Sketch-to-3D features.
