# Exploring AI Benchmarks & Leaderboards

## Introduction  
A **benchmark** is a standardized test or set of metrics used to measure and compare the performance, capabilities, or quality of systems, models, or algorithms. In the context of **AI and machine learning**, benchmarks provide a way to evaluate how well models perform on specific tasks or datasets, often with respect to predefined metrics like accuracy, speed, robustness, or resource efficiency.  

### **Why do we need Benchmarks?**  
- **Standardization**: Benchmarks define a consistent set of tasks, datasets, or metrics, ensuring comparability across different systems or models.  
- **Reproducibility**: Results from benchmarks are replicable by others using the same conditions and configurations.  
- **Metrics**: Benchmarks provide clear metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, latency) for evaluation.  
- **Domain-Specific**: Benchmarks can be tailored to specific tasks or domains (e.g., NLP, computer vision, robotics).  
- **Progress Measurement**: To track advancements in AI over time.  
- **Innovation Incentive**: To encourage researchers and developers to design better models that surpass existing benchmarks.  

### **What are the Components of an AI Benchmark?**  
1. **Dataset**: A collection of data used for training, validation, or testing. Examples: [ImageNet](https://www.image-net.org/), [SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/), [GLUE](https://gluebenchmark.com/).  
2. **Tasks**: Specific problems the model needs to solve, such as classification, translation, or question answering.  
3. **Metrics**: Quantitative measures for evaluation (e.g., precision, recall, BLEU score).  
4. **Baselines**: Pre-existing results or models to compare against (e.g., human performance or older algorithms).  

### **Types of Benchmarks**  
At high levels, benchmarks can be classified into **performance**, **robustness**, **efficiency**, and **ethics and fairness**.  
1. **Performance Benchmarks**: Evaluate how well a model performs a specific task (e.g., accuracy in classification tasks).  
2. **Robustness Benchmarks**: Test how models perform under challenging conditions, such as noise, adversarial inputs, or distribution shifts.  
3. **Efficiency Benchmarks**: Measure resource usage, such as computation time, memory, or energy consumption.  
4. **Ethics and Fairness Benchmarks**: Assess whether a model is fair and unbiased across demographic groups.  

## **What are widely known Benchmarks?**  
Each benchmark mentioned after this can be either **performance**, **robustness**, **efficiency**, or **ethics and fairness** benchmark.

An AI Leaderboard is a publicly available platform or tool that ranks AI models, systems, or algorithms based on their performance on predefined benchmarks or datasets. It acts as a scoreboard for comparing different approaches and identifying the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in specific AI tasks or domains. When above discussed different benchmarks are used by model provider or model evaluator against a given model then the performance of the model is reported on the leader board. So, a leaderboard is  

- Ranking Mechanism: Models are ranked according to their performance on a specific task, measured using metrics like accuracy, F1 score, BLEU, or others depending on the benchmark.
- Transparency: Leaderboards display detailed information about submitted models, including the methodology, configuration, and even code, fostering reproducibility and openness.
- Task-Specific: Each leaderboard is typically associated with a particular dataset or task, such as machine translation, image recognition, or reinforcement learning.
- Dynamic Updates: As new models are submitted, the rankings are updated, reflecting ongoing progress in the field.
- Community Engagement: Researchers and practitioners actively submit their models to compete for the top position, driving innovation and improvement.

### What are popular Leaderboard?

Here is a list of notable AI leaderboards and their purposes. Keep in mind, a leaderboard is as good as it is updated by the community and model builder. If a leaderboard is not seeing any activity in last 3-6 month time, it means there is better leaderboard in place of that and people are not using it to report the model performance. The leaderboard contains current progress of the model therefore they are hosted at some places. There are many hosting spaces where leaderboards are hosted and one of the famous is huggingface.
