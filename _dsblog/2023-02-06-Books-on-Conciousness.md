# Books on Conciousness   
   
## Introduction   
   
If you are from the software industry and especially in a data scientist role on day to day basis. Then there are high chances you ask questions like   
   
What is life?   
What is consciousness?   
What is the reality of existence?   
What is the final definition of God?   
What is the ultimate reality of this world?   
   
I am not saying you ask these questions because you are fed up or puzzled with your life. But because of different reasons. You are creating artificial intelligence systems.   
   
In my own way, I have been reading, listening, contemplating, and meditating on the above questions. Adi Sankar's Advaita Vedanta speaks a volume on this subject. But in the last 100 years, many western philosophers and scientists started researching and writing on this subject. Apart from your professional life where you are paid for your work. Apart from the day to day family and social responsibilities if you are serious and get some time to reflect on the above questions then a list of the following books may be of your interest.   
   
Note: I am not saying other professionals don't ask these questions. When life goes through different circumstances everyone at one point or another goes through these questions. But, a serious software engineer who writes software (intelligence) for the hardware (body) has a high probability of thinking about these questions.   
   
# 100+ Good Books on Conciousness   
  
## 1. The Principles of Psychology
William James, 1890

## 2. Modern Man in Search of a Soul
Carl Jung, 1933

Our consciousness is relatively uninteresting and insignificant compared with our unconscious. Most of what "I" really am and what "I" actually do wells up from far below the surface. Jung is one of the great explorers of the dark but sovereign subconscious. You’ll bump into his archetypes if you dream diligently, fast long enough, or sit down in a winter wood and stare into the middle distance.

## 3. The Origins and History of Consciousness
Erich Neumann, 1949

## 4. The Doors of Perception
Aldous Huxley, 1954

Based on his experiences of taking the hallucinogen mescaline. Huxley concluded that the brain acted like a reducing valve, slowing down the influx of data into our brains to a manageable dribble. We may be drawing conclusions about the universe on the basis of a tiny fraction of the available information. We might be misreading it radically. It has recently been shown that human neural networks can process 11 dimensions. We usually use only four. We’re wired up for much, much more reality than we think.

## 5. Be Here Now
Ram Dass, 1971

Guru Ram Dass tells the story of his spiritual awakening and gives you the tools to take control of your life in this "counterculture bible" (The New York Times) featuring powerful guidance on yoga, meditation, and finding your true self. In 1960s author was known as Professor Richard Alpert. He held appointments in four departments at Harvard University.
He published books, drove a Mercedes and regularly vacationed in the Caribbean. By most societal standards, he had achieved great success. . . . And yet he couldn’t escape the feeling that something was missing.  Psilocybin and LSD changed that. During a period of experimentation, Alpert peeled away each layer of his identity, disassociating from himself as a professor, a social cosmopolite, and lastly, as a physical being. Fear turned into exaltation upon the realization that at his truest, he was just his inner-self: a luminous being that he could trust indefinitely and love infinitely. Thus, a spiritual journey commenced. Alpert headed to India where his guru renamed him Baba Ram Dass—"servant of God." He was introduced to mindful breathing exercises, hatha yoga, and Eastern philosophy. If he found himself reminiscing or planning, he was reminded to "Be Here Now." He started upon the path of enlightenment, and has been journeying along it ever since. Be Here Now is a vehicle for sharing the true message, and a guide to self-determination.

## 6. The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind
Julian Jaynes, 1976


## 7. The Mind's I
Daniel Dennett, 1981

## 8. The ending of time
J Krishnamurti, 1985

The provocative and penetrating philosophical classic of science and spirituality (a discourse between the revered spiritual leader Krishnamurti and renowned physicist Dr. David Bohm). Exploring the origin of human conflict and what we can do about the barriers that stand in the way of insight and consciousness, now revised and updated with a new introduction and added dialogues.

**The Ending of Time** is a series of important and enlightening dialogues in which Jiddu Krishnamurti and Dr. David Bohm. Dr David is a men from vastly different backgrounds in philosophy and physics, respectively—debate profound existential questions that illuminate the fundamental nature of existence, probing topics such as insight, illusion, awakening, transcendence,  renewal, morality, the temporal, and the spiritual. Along the way, Krishnamurti and Bohm explore a person’s relationship to society and offer new insights on human thought, death, awakening, self realization, and the problem of the fragmented mind.

The Ending of Time also refers to the wrong turn humanity has taken (a state that they argue can be corrected). Though they insist that mankind can change fundamentally, they warn that transformation requires going from one’s narrow and particular interests toward the general, and ultimately moving still deeper into that purity of compassion, love and intelligence that originates beyond thought, time, and even emptiness.

This updated edition, edited and revised in clear and engaging language, includes a new introduction and a conversation previously published separately which examines “The Future of Humanity.”

## 22. Chaos, Creativity, and Cosmic Consciousness
Rupert Sheldrake, Terence McKenna, Ralph Abraham, Jean Houston Ph.D., 2001

Three of the most original thinkers of our time explore issues that call into question our current views of reality, morality, and the nature of life. A wide-ranging investigation of the ecology of inner and outer space, the role of chaos theory in the dynamics of human creation, and the rediscovery of traditional wisdom.

In this book of "trialogues," the late psychedelic visionary and shamanologist Terence McKenna, acclaimed biologist and originator of the morphogenetic fields theory Rupert Sheldrake, and mathematician and chaos theory scientist Ralph Abraham explore the relationships between chaos and creativity and their connection to cosmic consciousness. Their observations call into question our current views of reality, morality, and the nature of life in the universe. The authors challenge the reader to the deepest levels of thought with wide-ranging investigations of the ecology of inner and outer space, the role of chaos in the dynamics of human creation, and the resacralization of the world. Among the provocative questions the authors raise are: Is Armageddon a self-fulfilling prophecy? Are we humans the imaginers or the imagined? Are the eternal laws of nature still evolving? What is the connection between physical light and the light of consciousness? Part ceremony, part old-fashioned intellectual discussion, these trialogues are an invitation to a new understanding of what Jean Houston calls "the dreamscapes of our everyday waking life."

## 23. The illusion of conscious will
Daniel Wegner, 2002

## 24. Consciousness: An Introduction

## 28. Irreducible Mind
Bruce Greyson, 2006

Current mainstream opinion in psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy of mind holds that all aspects of human mind and consciousness are generated by physical processes occurring in brains. Views of this sort have dominated recent scholarly publication. The present volume, however, demonstrates empirically that this reductive materialism is not only incomplete but false. The authors systematically marshal evidence for a variety of psychological phenomena that are extremely difficult, and in some cases clearly impossible, to account for in conventional physicalist terms.

Topics addressed include phenomena of extreme psychophysical influence, memory, psychological automatisms and secondary personality, near-death experiences and allied phenomena, genius-level creativity, and 'mystical' states of consciousness both spontaneous and drug-induced. The authors further show that these rogue phenomena are more readily accommodated by an alternative 'transmission' or 'filter' theory of mind/brain relations advanced over a century ago by a largely forgotten genius, F. W. H. Myers, and developed further by his friend and colleague William James. This theory, moreover, ratifies the commonsense conception of human beings as causally effective conscious agents, and is fully compatible with leading-edge physics and neuroscience. The book should command the attention of all open-minded persons concerned with the still-unsolved mysteries of the mind.

## 29. Philosophy of Mind
Feser, Edward, Oneworld Publications, 2006

In this lively and entertaining introduction to the philosophy of mind, Edward Feser explores the questions central to the discipline, and relates them not only to the human brain and its capacity for thought, but also to the increasing sophistication of artificial intelligence. This in-depth primer is an account of all the most important and significant attempts that have been made to answer the riddles of consciousness and thought.

## 30. Seeking Wisdom: From Darwin to Munger, 3rd Edition
Peter Bevelin, 2007

The author begins his fascinating book with Confucius' great wisdom: "A man who has committed a mistake and doesn't correct it, is committing another mistake." Seeking Wisdom is the result of Bevelin's learning about attaining wisdom. His quest for wisdom originated partly from making mistakes himself and observing those of others but also from the philosophy of super-investor and Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman **Charles Munger**. A man whose simplicity and clarity of thought was unequal to anything Bevelin had seen.

In addition to naturalist Charles Darwin and Munger, Bevelin cites an encyclopedic range of thinkers: from first-century BCE Roman poet **Publius Terentius** to **Mark Twain**, from **Albert Einstein** to **Richard Feynman**, from 16th Century French essayist **Michel de Montaigne** to Berkshire Hathaway Chairman **Warren Buffett**. In the book, he describes ideas and research findings from many different fields. This book is for those who love the constant search for knowledge. It is in the spirit of Charles Munger, who says, "All I want to know is where I'm going to die so I'll never go there." There are roads that lead to unhappiness. An understanding of how and why we can "die" should help us avoid them. We can't eliminate mistakes, but we can prevent those that can really hurt us. Using exemplars of clear thinking and attained wisdom, Bevelin focuses on how our thoughts are influenced, why we make misjudgments and tools to improve our thinking. Bevelin tackles such eternal questions as: Why do we behave like we do? What do we want out of life? What interferes with our goals? Read and study this wonderful multidisciplinary exploration of wisdom. It may change the way you think and act in business and in life.

## 31. I Am a Strange Loop
Douglas Hofstadter, 2007

## 32. The Center Cannot Hold: My Journey Through Madness
Elyn Saks, 2007

## 33. The Head Trip: Adventures on the Wheel of Consciousness
Jeff Warren, 2007

## 34. The Demon-haunted World : Science As a Candle in the Dark
Carl Sagan, 2008

A glorious book . . . A spirited defense of science . . . From the first page to the last, this book is a manifesto for clear thought. Los Angeles Times "POWERFUL . . . A stirring defense of informed rationality. . . Rich in surprising information and beautiful writing." How can we make intelligent decisions about our increasingly technology-driven lives if we don't understand the difference between the myths of pseudoscience and the testable hypotheses of science?

Pulitzer Prize-winning author and distinguished astronomer Carl Sagan argues that scientific thinking is critical not only to the pursuit of truth but to the very well-being of our democratic institutions. Casting a wide net through history and culture, Sagan examines and authoritatively debunks such celebrated fallacies of the past as witchcraft, faith healing, demons, and UFOs. And yet, disturbingly, in today's so-called information age, pseudoscience is burgeoning with stories of alien abduction, channeling past lives, and communal hallucinations commanding growing attention and respect. As Sagan demonstrates with lucid eloquence, the siren song of unreason is not just a cultural wrong turn but a dangerous plunge into darkness that threatens our most basic freedoms.

## 35. The ego tunnel
Thomas Metzinger, 2009

## 36. Biocentrism:
**How Life and Consciousness are the Keys to Understanding the True Nature of the Univer**   
Robert Lanza, 2009

## 37. The ESP Enigma: The Scientific Case for Psychic Phenomena
Diane Hennacy Powell, 2009

A revolutionary explanation of the link between **psychic phenomena** and how **human consciousness** works.
Dr. Diane Powell, a prominent Johns Hopkins–trained neuropsychiatrist, examines the evidence for many types of psychic phenomena **telepathy, precognition, psychokinesis**, and finds several well-designed and rigorously supervised studies that prove the existence of some psychic phenomena.
The fact that psychic abilities are stronger among **prodigies, autistic savants**, and some people who are **bipolar** or have suffered certain **brain injuries** has led to brain-imaging and other research that can explain which parts of the brain are dominant in psychics and mystics. Dr. Powell proposes a new paradigm for consciousness that would explain psychic phenomena, such as how the mind of a mystic or psychic could have an organizational effect on the physical world. Grounded in decades of reliable scientific research, The ESP Enigma establishes a common ground among psychic phenomena believers and skeptics

## 38. Cosmic Consciousness
**A Study in the Evolution of the Human Mind**   
Richard Maurice Bucke, 2010

## 39. The True Believer :
**Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements**   
Eric Hoffer, 2010

Its theme is political fanaticism, with which it deals severely and brilliantly.  On the San Francisco docks in the 1940s, Eric Hoffer wrote philosophical treatises in his spare time while living in the railroad yards. The True Believer—the first and most famous of his books—was made into a bestseller when President Eisenhower cited it during one of the earliest television press conferences.This landmark in the field of social psychology is completely relevant and essential for understanding the world today as it delivers a visionary, highly provocative look into the mind of the fanatic and a penetrating study of how an individual becomes one.

## 40. Consciousness: Confessions of a Romantic Reductionist
Christof Koch, 2012

## 41. Phi: A Voyage from the Brain to the Soul
Giulio Tononi, 2012

## 42. Breaking Convention: Essays on Psychedelic Consciousness
David Luke, 2013

## 43. Breaking Convention: Essays on Psychedelic Consciousness
by David Luke and Dave King, 2013
One of a set of proceedings of a biennial conference focusing on the academic study of psychedelics and related subjects such as shamanism and out of body and near-death experiences. Tectonic scientific progress is made by looking at the outliers – the evidence that doesn’t fit with your comforting old preconceptions. These studies do that.

## 44. Hallucinations
Oliver Sacks, 2013

## 45. Le Code de la conscience
Stanislas Dehaene, 2014

## 46. The Seat of the Soul
25th Anniversary Edition with a Study Guide

## 47. The Soul of an Octopus:
**A Surprising Exploration into the Wonder of Consciousness**   
Sy Montgomery, 2015

## 48. Beyond Words: What Animals Think and Feel
Carl Safina, 2015

Moving accounts of the reasons to suppose that various non-humans, including orcas, wolves and elephants, have emotions and a type of consciousness akin to ours. If they are conscious, why shouldn’t stones be conscious too?

## 49. Other Minds: The Octopus, the Sea, and the Deep Origins of Consciousness
Peter Godfrey-Smith, 2016
Examines the weird mystery of consciousness, charts its potential evolution from when life began. Drawing on his experience as a philosopher and enthusiastic scuba diver, author thoughtfully uses the octopus, a deeply alien yet oddly intelligent creature, to trace our inner lives back to their roots, and beautifully weaves in the story of how nature became aware of itself.

## 50. Scatterlings: Getting Claimed in the Age of Amnesia
Martin Shaw, 2016

Very few books about the wild are wild, and so very few are worthy of their subject. This one is. It’s a tale of how to be claimed by a place, and about how we’re dying because (being stories ourselves) we need good stories, as we need clean air, and yet we’re offered only the tawdry stories of material reductionism and the free market – stories which literally de-mean us. Shaw knows how stories seep out of the earth. The earth, like everything, has agency, and it wants us to audition for parts in its constantly evolving stories.

## 51. Stealing Fire:
**How Silicon Valley, the Navy SEALs, and Maverick Scientists Are Revolutionizing the Way We Live and Work**   
Steven Kotler, 2017

## 52. From Bacteria to Bach and Back
Daniel Dennett, 2017

## 53. The River of Consciousness
Oliver Sacks, 2017

## 54. The Focus of Life

## 55. The Heartfulness Way:
**Heart-Based Meditations for Spiritual Transformation**   
Kamlesh D. Patel, Joshua Pollock, James R. Doty MD, Varun Soni PhD, 2018

A must-read for anyone interested in incorporating meditation into their lifestyle. A spiritual way of living by and from the heart that is inclusive of all ideologies, beliefs, and religions. In this heart-centered book, a student in conversation with his teacher, Kamlesh D. Patel—affectionately known as Daaji, the fourth and current spiritual guide of the century-old Heartfulness tradition—present a unique method of meditation with the power to facilitate an immediate, tangible spiritual experience, irrespective of a person’s faith. Our modern, fast-paced world can be an overwhelming place. Every day, we’re bombarded with messages telling us that in order to be happy, fulfilled, and worthy, we must be better, do more, and accumulate as much material wealth as possible. Most of us move through our busy lives with our minds full of these ideas, multitasking as we strive to navigate the responsibilities and expectations we must meet just to make it through the day. But what if there is another way? What if, rather than letting the busyness of life overtake our minds, we learn to be heartful instead?Based on Daaji’s own combination of approaches and practices for the modern seeker—which draws from the teachings of Sahaj Marg, meaning "Natural Path"—Heartfulness is a contemporized version of the ancient Indian practice of Raja Yoga, a tradition that enables the practitioner to realize the higher Self within. While many books describe refined states of being, The Heartfulness Way goes further, providing a pragmatic course to experience those states for oneself, which, per the book’s guiding principle, is "greater than knowledge."Heartfulness meditation consists of four elements—relaxation, meditation, cleaning, and prayer—and illuminates the ancient, defining feature of yogic transmission (or pranahuti), the utilization of divine energy for spiritual growth and transformation. Using the method, detailed practices, tips, and practical philosophy offered in this book, you’ll reach new levels of attainment and learn to live a life more deeply connected to the values of the Heartfulness way—with acceptance, humility, compassion, empathy, and love.

## 56. The Manual : A Philosopher's Guide to Life
Epictetus, Sam Torode, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, 2017   

## 57. Becoming Supernatural : How Common People Are Doing the Uncommon
Dr. Joe Dispenza, 2017     

The author of the New York Times bestseller **You Are the Placebo**, as well as **Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself and Evolve Your Brain**, draws on research conducted at his advanced workshops since 2012 to explore how common people are doing the uncommon to transform themselves and their lives. Becoming Supernatural marries some of the most profound scientific information with ancient wisdom to show how people like you and me can experience a more mystical life.

Readers will learn that we are, quite literally supernatural by nature if given the proper knowledge and instruction, and when we learn how to apply that information through various meditations, we should experience a greater expression of our creative abilities; that we have the capacity to tune in to frequencies beyond our material world and receive more orderly coherent streams of consciousness and energy; that we can intentionally change our brain chemistry to initiate profoundly mystical transcendental experiences; and how, if we do this enough times, we can develop the skill of creating a more efficient, balanced, healthy body, a more unlimited mind, and greater access to the realms of spiritual truth. Topics include: Demystifying the body’s 7 energy centers and how you can balance them to heal? How to free yourself from the past by reconditioning your body to a new mind? How you can create reality in the generous present moment by changing your energy? The difference between third-dimension creation and fifth-dimension creation? The secret science of the pineal gland and its role in accessing mystical realms of reality. The distinction between Space-Time vs. Time-Space realities etc. Using tools and disciplines ranging from cutting-edge physics to practical exercises such as a walking meditation, Dr. Joe offers nothing less than a program for stepping outside our physical reality and into the quantum field of infinite possibilities.

## 58. Ideas toward a Phenomenology of Interruptions
Cameron Bassiri, 2018

## 59. How to Change Your Mind:
**What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence , psychedelics**    
Michael Pollan, 2018

The effects of psychedelics on our lives and gain insight into our lives and the world around us. Psychedelics have also been used to treat addiction, depression, and trauma. Furthermore, experts in the field have provided insight into the science behind psychedelics and how they can help to make a difference in our lives.

## 60. Altered States of Consciousness:
**Experiences Out of Time and Self**   
Marc Wittmann, 2018

What altered states of consciousness—the dissolution of feelings of time and self—can tell us about the mystery of consciousness. During extraordinary moments of consciousness—shock, meditative states and sudden mystical revelations, out-of-body experiences, or drug intoxication—our senses of time and self are altered; we may even feel time and self dissolving. These experiences have long been ignored by mainstream science, or considered crazy fantasies. Recent research, however, has located the neural underpinnings of these altered states of mind.

In this book, neuropsychologist Marc Wittmann shows how experiences that disturb or widen our everyday understanding of the self can help solve the mystery of consciousness. Wittmann explains that the relationship between consciousness of time and consciousness of self is close; in extreme circumstances, the experiences of space and self intensify and weaken together. He considers the emergence of the self in waking life and dreams; how our sense of time is distorted by extreme situations ranging from terror to mystical enlightenment; the experience of the moment; and the loss of time and self in such disorders as depression, schizophrenia, and epilepsy. Dostoyevsky reported godly bliss during epileptic seizures; neurologists are now investigating the phenomenon of the epileptic aura. Wittmann describes new studies of psychedelics that show how the brain builds consciousness of self and time, and discusses pilot programs that use hallucinogens to treat severe depression, anxiety, and addiction.If we want to understand our consciousness, our subjectivity, Wittmann argues, we must not be afraid to break new ground. Studying altered states of consciousness leads us directly to the heart of the matter: time and self, the foundations of consciousness.

## 61. Stealing Fire :
**How Silicon Valley, the Navy SEALs, and Maverick Scientists Are Revolutionizing the Way We Live and Work**   
Steven Kotler, Jamie Wheal, 2018

The biggest revolution you’ve never heard of, and it’s hiding in plain sight. Over the past decade, Silicon Valley executives like Eric Schmidt and Elon Musk, Special Operators like the Navy SEALs and the Green Berets, and maverick scientists like Sasha Shulgin and Amy Cuddy have turned everything we thought we knew about high performance upside down. Instead of grit, better habits, or 10,000 hours, these trailblazers have found a surprising short cut.

They're harnessing rare and controversial states of consciousness to solve critical challenges and outperform the competition. New York Times bestselling author Steven Kotler and high performance expert Jamie Wheal spent four years investigating the leading edges of this revolution, from the home of SEAL Team Six to the Googleplex, the Burning Man festival, Richard Branson’s Necker Island, Red Bull’s training center, Nike’s innovation team, and the United Nations’ Headquarters. And what they learned was stunning: In their own ways, with differing languages, techniques, and applications, every one of these groups has been quietly seeking the same thing: the boost in information and inspiration that altered states provide. Today, this revolution is spreading to the mainstream, fueling a trillion dollar underground economy and forcing us to rethink how we can all lead richer, more productive, more satisfying lives. Driven by four accelerating forces psychology, neurobiology, technology and pharmacology. We are gaining access to and insights about some of the most contested and misunderstood terrain in history. Stealing Fire is a provocative examination of what’s actually possible; a guidebook for anyone who wants to radically upgrade their life.

## 62. Quantum Revelation
**A Radical Synthesis of Science and Spirituality**   
Paul Levy, Jean Houston, 2018

The Quantum Revelation is mind-blowing. To say that quantum physics is the greatest scientific discovery of all time is not an exaggeration. In their discovery of the quantum realm, the physics community stumbled upon a genuine multifaceted revelation which can be likened to a profound spiritual treasure. A heretofore undreamed of creative power―hidden within our own mind. Quantum physics unequivocally points out that the study of the universe and the study of consciousness are inseparably linked, which is to say that ultimate progress in the one will be impossible without progress in the other.

Einstein declared that what it reveals is so immensely important that "it should be everyone’s concern." Yet few of us in the general public truly understand how the game-changing discoveries of the past century not only relate to our day-to-day lives, but also give us insights into the nature of reality and our place within it. Written for readers with no physics background, Paul Levy’s latest book, The Quantum Revelation: A Radical Synthesis of Science and Spirituality is for those who have heard that quantum physics is a fascinating subject but don’t quite understand how or why. Levy contemplates the deeper philosophical underpinnings of quantum physics, exploring the fundamental questions it provokes: What does it mean that quantum theory has discovered that **there is no such thing as "objective reality?"** How are we participating, via our consciousness, in creating our experience of a reality that quantum theory itself describes as "dreamlike?" What are the implications for us in our day-to-day lives that what we call reality is more like a dream that we had previously imagined? The Quantum Revelation is unique in how it synthesizes science and spirituality so as to reveal and explore the dreamlike nature of reality. It is a book not just for people interested in quantum theory, but for anyone who is interested in waking up and dreaming lucidly, be it in our night dreams or our waking life.

## 63. Thus Spoke the Plant
**A Remarkable Journey of Groundbreaking Scientific Discoveries and Personal Encounters with Plants**   
Monica Gagliano, Suzanne Simard, 2018

An accessible and compelling story of a scientist's discovery of plant communication and how it influenced her research and changed her life. In this "phytobiography"--a collection of stories written in partnership with a plant, researcher reveals the dynamic role plants play in genuine first-hand accounts from her research into plant communication and cognition.

By transcending the view of plants as the objects of scientific materialism, Gagliano encourages us to rethink plants as people, beings with subjectivity, consciousness, and volition, and hence having the capacity for their own perspectives and voices. The book draws on up-close-and-personal encounters with the plants themselves, as well as plant shamans, indigenous elders, and mystics from around the world and integrates these experiences with an incredible research journey and the groundbreaking scientific discoveries that emerged from it. Gagliano has published numerous peer-reviewed scientific papers on how plants have a Pavlov-like response to stimuli and can learn, remember, and communicate to neighboring plants. She has pioneered the brand-new research field of plant bioacoustics, for the first time experimentally demonstrating that plants emit their own 'voices' and, moreover, detect and respond to the sounds of their environments. By demonstrating experimentally that learning is not the exclusive province of animals, Gagliano has re-ignited the discourse on plant subjectivity and ethical and legal standing. This is the story of how she made those discoveries and how the plants helped her along the way.

## 64. The Evolving Self : A Psychology for the Third Millennium ***
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, 2018

Premised on the idea that only through a reckoning with our evolutionary past can we build a stable, meaningful future, The Evolving Self covers the challenges associated with our cognitive evolutionary history ("As far as controlling the mind is concerned, we are like a novice driver behind the wheel of a racing car"); the distortions of reality we experience due to genes, culture, and our sense of self; and the central importance of "flow" from an evolutionary perspective as we look toward the future.Erudite, perceptive, and insightful—and more important now than ever, as our consciousnesses are increasingly mediated by electronic devices — The Evolving Self is a timely resource for anyone looking to improve our world for ourselves and for generations to come.

## 65. Beyond UFOs
**The Science of Consciousness & Contact with Non Human Intelligence**   
Reinerio Hernandez J.D., Rudy Schild PH.D., Jon Klimo PH.D., 2018

This 820 page book details the academic research findings of FREE (the world’s first comprehensive multi-language quantitative and qualitative 5 year academic research study on individuals that have had UFO related contact with Non Human Intelligence (NHI)). Over the last 5 years FREE has collected detailed responses to 3 extensive quantitative and qualitative surveys from over 4,200 individuals from over 100 countries. Our survey findings from these thousands of "Experiencers" contradict much of what is circulating in mainstream materialist Ufology.

Our academic book will establish a new paradigm for viewing the UAP (UFO) Contact Phenomenon. FREE argues that "Consciousness" and the paranormal and psychic aspects of this phenomenon is the key to understanding this complex phenomenon instead of the traditional materialist perspective of "nuts & bolt's" Ufology. The Dr. Edgar Mitchell Foundation for Research into Extraterrestrial and Extraordinary Experiences, or FREE, is a 501(c)(3) Academic Research Not for Profit Foundation. FREE was co-founded by the late Apollo 14 astronaut Dr. Edgar Mitchell, Dr. Rudy Schild, an Emeritus Research Astronomer at the Harvard/Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics at Harvard University, Australian researcher Mary Rodwell and Rey Hernandez, an Attorney and Experiencer who was a Ph.D. Candidate at the University of California at Berkeley. FREE is comprised of retired academic professors and lay researchers who have been researching the field of Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon (UAP) and contact with Non-Human Intelligence (NHI) for more than 30 years.

## 78. The Upanishads
Eknath Easwaran, 2019

Easwaran’s best-selling translation of the ancient wisdom texts called the Upanishads is reliable, readable, and profound.In the Upanishads, illumined sages share flashes of insight, the results of their investigation into consciousness itself. In extraordinary visions, they have direct experience of a transcendent Reality which is the essence, or Self, of each created being. They teach that each of us, each Self, is eternal, deathless, one with the power that created the universe. Easwaran’s translation of the principal Upanishads and five others includes an overview of the cultural and historical setting, with chapter introductions, notes, and a Sanskrit glossary. But it is Easwaran’s understanding of the wisdom of the Upanishads that makes this edition truly outstanding.

## 79. Metahuman : Unleashing Your Infinite Potential
Deepak Chopra M.D., 2019

Deepak Chopra argues that consciousness is the sole creator of self, mind, brain, body, and the universe, and provides a 31-day guide to becoming Metahuman. He suggests that we can break through a blinded and illusionary “virtual reality” and understand our non-physical experience that is beyond the physical and infinite. Chopra also provides a strategy to expand our consciousness in all that we think, say, and do, and to liberate ourselves from the conditioning and constructs that underlie anxiety, tension, and ego-driven demands.

## 80. Spiritual Science
**Why Science Needs Spirituality to Make Sense of the World**   
Steve Taylor, 2019

Spiritual Science offers an alternative, spiritual view of reality that transcends both conventional science and religion, and answers many of the riddles that neither can explain. The standard model of science has had little success in explaining such areas as human consciousness, the connection between the mind and the body, altruism and 'anomalous' phenomena such as near-death experiences, psi phenomena (such as telepathy) and spiritual experiences. But from a 'panspiritist' point of view - which sees spirit or consciousness as a fundamental essence of reality - it is possible to make sense of all these things.

Steve Taylor puts forward the evidence for a spiritual view of reality, drawing on the insights of philosophers, physicists, mystics, as well as spiritual traditions and indigenous cultures. He systematically shows how a 'panspiritist' view can explain many puzzling aspects of science and the world, including evolution and the origins of life, and a wide range of other phenomena such as quantum physics, the placebo effect, precognition and neuroplasticity. Spiritual Science offers a new vision of the world that is compatible with both modern science and ancient spiritual teachings. It provides a more accurate and holistic account of reality than conventional science or religion, integrating a wide range of phenomena that are excluded from both. After showing how the materialist worldview demeans the world and human life, Spiritual Science offers, a vision of the world as sacred and interconnected and of human life as meaningful and purposeful. Spiritual Science explains how the standard materialist model of reality developed, and turned into a belief system. This belief system can only function by denying (or explaining away) a whole range of phenomena that are part of human experience

## 83. Dreams of Light
**The Profound Daytime Practice of Lucid Dreaming**   
Andrew Holecek, 2020

A world-renowned expert in lucid dreaming and Tibetan dream yoga guides us into the tradition’s daytime practices, a complement to the nighttime practices taught in his previous book **Dream Yoga**.Most of us are absolutely certain that we’re awake here and now. Yet, according to Tibet’s dream yoga tradition, ordinary waking life is no more real than the illusions of our nightly dreams. In his previous book Dream Yoga, Andrew Holecek guided us into Tibetan Buddhism’s nocturnal path of lucid dreaming and other dimensions of sleeping consciousness.

Now, with Dreams of Light, he offers us an in-depth, step-by-step guide to its daytime practices. Known as the "illusory form" practices, these teachings include insights, meditations, and actions to help us realize the dreamlike nature of our lives. Through an immersive exploration of the tradition, beginners and seasoned practitioners alike will learn everything they need to deeply transform both their sleeping and waking hours."If you’ve struggled to awaken in your dreams," teaches Holecek, "these techniques will often spark spontaneous lucidity during sleep. And if you’re already a successful lucid dreamer, they will open you to new depths of experience throughout your day." For those wishing to explore Tibetan Buddhism’s profound path for awakening to the true nature of reality―day or night―Dreams of Light shows us the way.

## 84. Architecture of the Afterlife
**The Flipside Code: Discovering the Blueprint for the Great Beyond**   
Richard Martini, 2020

After filming 50 cases of people under hypnosis saying the same things about the afterlife. After working with medium Jennifer Shaffer talking to people directly, author began to focus his research on people who were NOT under hypnosis, but who could recall a vivid event; a dream, a near death experience or something that was consciousness altered.

By asking simple questions to them about their experience, I found that I could "ask them" to invite "people on the flipside" into the conversation, including loved ones no longer on the planet, including guides, teachers and council members that are aware of all of their lifetimes, as well as have answers to key questions about the nature of reality, about consciousness about how things work. By asking nearly 50 people not under any form of hypnosis "the same questions" to these "people on the flipside" - I was startled to see that they said the same things about the journey that the people under hypnosis have said. Within these pages, people are going to read or here things that will upset their paradigm, that will challenge their belief system, that will force them to rethink (or at least consider rethinking) everything they've ever been told about the journey. As one science based author wrote to me in an email "Your experiments, which I have tried on my own and replicated, have "shaken me to my core." I am a filmmaker and author, I have been filming people talking about the afterlife for over a decade, and have reported extensively how I came to this line of questioning. These reports have been gathered over the past two years; some remain anonymous, some are not - either way, they're people fully conscious, eyes open, staring into the distance over my shoulder (or speaking live on the radio) accessing vistas and worlds I've heard about from other people. The reports are consistent and they are reproducible. We apparently choose our lifetimes, bring "about a third" of our conscious energy to any given performance, when the play is over, we "return home" to connect with our loved ones, teachers, and guides. These accounts point to another reality altogether - one that does not include fear, does not include attachment to worry, an understanding of why we each chose our lifetime and what we are here to learn. As Gary Schwartz PhD wrote in the Introduction to Flipside "As you read Richard’s journey of personal discovery in the context of these great questions, you will awaken to a vision of mind and the universe which is filled with opportunity and awe.

## 91. The Ra Material
**Law of One: 40th-Anniversary Boxed Set**   
Jim McCarty, Don Elkins, Carla L. Rueckert, 2020

Is our universe intelligently designed? What are the possibilities of healing, transformation, and service? What is the Law of One? After 19 years of research into the channeling phenomenon that involved communications with members of the Confederation of Planets in the Service of the One Infinite Creator, a group consciousness called Ra, who had evolved on the planet Venus, established contact with three dedicated seekers of truth to explore these and other questions. Ra said that all people and all of creation are One Being: the One Infinite Creator. They suggested that the process of learning to love (awakening to the "Original Thought") is studied via humanity’s movement through all of time. The Ra Material  sessions conducted by these three individuals examine the meaning of our cosmic existence and contain 106 transcripts of every conversation, including events leading up to first contact, and, in Book V, commentary about the contact. This 40th-anniversary boxed set includes all five books in hard cover.

## 105. Feline Philosophy: Cats and the Meaning of Life
John Gray, 2021

The author of Straw Dogs, famous for his provocative critiques of scientific hubris and the delusions of progress and humanism, turns his attention to cats―and what they reveal about humans' torturous relationship to the world and to themselves. The history of philosophy has been a predictably tragic or comical succession of palliatives for human disquiet. Thinkers from **Spinoza** to **Berdyaev** have pursued the perennial questions of how to be happy, how to be good, how to be loved, and how to live in a world of change and loss.

But perhaps **we can learn more from cats than from the great thinkers of the world.** In Feline Philosophy, the philosopher **John Gray** discovers in cats a way of living that is unburdened by anxiety and self-consciousness, showing how they embody answers to the big questions of love and attachment, mortality, morality, and the Self. Montaigne's house cat, whose un-examined life may have been the one worth living; Meo, the Vietnam War survivor with an unshakable capacity for "fearless joy"; and Colette's Saha, the feline heroine of her subversive short story "The Cat", a parable about the pitfalls of human jealousy. Exploring the nature of cats, and what we can learn from it, Gray offers a profound, thought-provoking meditation on the follies of human exceptionalism and our fundamentally vulnerable and lonely condition. He charts a path toward a life without illusions and delusions, revealing how we can endure both crisis and transformation, and adapt to a changed scene, as cats have always done.

**Learn About Paradoxes Of Mathematics, Biology & Philosophy: Paradoxes Of Physics**   
Brynn Thoams, 2021

Reality is the aggregate of all that is real or existent within a system, as opposed to that which is only imaginary. In physical reality, when we interact with an object and follow through with a perceived affordance, the resultant action tells us whether that affordance was real or false. This book presents current knowledge of physics and highlights significant Indian contributions to the subject. The contents are as much about what is known as about what remains to be known and it speaks of a variety of paradoxes of mathematics and physics. They argue that there is a hidden order in physical reality that transcends the capacity of rational models help to illuminate the secrets of consciousness. Let's discover how consciousness works in life right now!

## 111. Conscious Automata: Brain as a Mental Machine
Thomas H. Huxley, William James, Lloyd Morgan, Rowland G. Hazard, 2021   

Is Brain a Computer? Since René Descartes and his Cartesian philosophy, human brain has been depicted as a machine which has sensory inputs, and actions as output. This understanding gained a lot of interest especially in the 20th century with the development of computers and logical circuitry. Today, all our sciences (cognitive sciences, psychology, neuroscience, and so on) use brain-computer analogy in order to understand the workings of the brain and the essence of human mind. However, there is one big problem. We know that machines only perform what they are programmed to perform, and they obey the will of their designers.

Then, how can we have conscious machines or automata which go beyond the limits of its programme and originate genuine behavior? In this book, you will discover some of the most-educated answers given to this and similar questions by the founding fathers of psychology and philosophy of mind. The articles are carefully selected among hundreds of similar writings on the subject in order to ease the reader's way into the subject. No background in pscyhology, phsyiology or philosophy is required. **The book consists of 4 articles by**: Thomas Henry Huxley (the great British biologist), William James (aka the founder of Pragmatism), Lloyd Morgan (aka the founding father of Academic Psychology), Rowland Hazard (the great American social reformer). In the book, you will find the answers to the following questions: What is an automaton? Is human body a machine/automaton? Does human brain work mechanically? Are animals automata? Are humans automata? Can machines think? Can machines gain consciousness? What are the physiological and biological basis of thoughts and ideas? Is mind a mechanism? Can a machine solve problems as well as humans do? You will also find many intriguing experiments on human and animal minds.

Some excerpts from the book: "A French soldier, a sergeant, was wounded at the battle of Bareilles. The man was shot in what we call the left parietal bone. The bullet, I presume, glanced off, but it fractured the bone. ... At present this man lives two lives, a normal life and an abnormal life. In his normal life he is perfectly well, cheerful, and a capital hospital attendant, does all his work well, and is a respectable, well-conducted man. That normal life lasts for about seven-and-twenty days, or thereabouts, out of every month; but for a day or two in each month—generally at intervals of about that time—he passes into another life, suddenly, and without warning or intimation. In this life he is still active, goes about just as usual, ... nut in this condition he neither sees, nor hears, nor tastes, nor smells, nor is he conscious of any thing whatever, and has only one sense-organ in a state of activity—viz., that of touch, which is exceedingly delicate." Our problem consequently is: Of what use to a nervous system is a super added consciousness? Can a brain which has it function better than a brain without it? And to answer this question, we must know, first, the natural defects of the brain, and secondly, the peculiar powers of its mental correlate.

This provocative book proposes that the fourth dimension of existence can provide the perspective and comprehension necessary to arrive at logical answers to the unanswered questions of our existence. The Fourth Dimension of Existence draws on the author’s unique education. The author feels that a thorough fusion of the methodologies of science, philosophy, and religion could yield logical answers to the questions humans have been asking themselves since the dawn of human consciousness.

## 115. Humanism : Its Science & Philosophy An Introduction
K.K. Jayarajan, 2021

Humanism is an investigative journey through the mind of man within the reality of universal harmony of finite and infinite. Here the intellect is the infinite factor of consciousness, and the self is the finite factor consisting of biological, physical and mental regions. This book envisages the idea that a healthy mind is also a fully conscious mind where the finite self and infinite consciousness are harmonising with feminine-masculine principles to create and recreate the world with humanism.

## 116. The Rediscovery of Hope and Purpose
**Awakening the Human Spirit**   
Christopher W. Albrecht, 2021

The world is hungry to have an awakening. Hope and purpose are just waiting to be discovered. This is my guidebook. In 1938, a three-year-old Bavarian boy's father was called to war. His destination was the Russian front. The boy vividly remembered the family's outhouse. Toilet paper hung from a wire, but when the Great War came, the toilet paper was replaced with newspaper. Then there came a day that the newspaper, too, would be gone. All that was left were the religious texts of the boy's father, a Lutheran minister.

A decision by the boy's mother had to be made, and the fallout later would have a postwar German family trying to put the pieces of their lives back together. Their quest: to rediscover their hope and purpose when everything had been stripped away from their lives. The description came to me from my father in a handwritten letter in March of 2020 as the global pandemic was bringing back long buried thoughts about the war.The Rediscovery of Hope and Purpose projects light on a course of action for civic and personal development. This book is unique in that it does not advocate for change. A moral compass of hope and purpose is alive within each person, but over time many people lose the ability to recognize this. This book helps you, the reader, rediscover the comfort and joy that come from living a life of hope and purpose through a call to rediscovery, not change. Written from the vantage point of a seasoned educator who is a former New York State Teacher of the Year and National Teachers Hall of Famer, this book contains explicit examples to guide readers by focusing on factors that can improve individuals and communities. The Rediscovery of Hope and Purpose challenges hopelessness by providing an uplifting experience. The book is designed to drive home a compelling message that hope and purpose are eternal fires ready to be rediscovered. It unlocks the shackles so many have clamped on hope allowing for a reawakening. Ten highly encaptivating interviews with inspiring people from all walks of life, intertwined with narratives, and history provide an investigation into social philosophy that promise the reader to think deeper and reflect stronger on the future. This book is based in a brand-new genre coined **Investigative Social Philosophy**.


## 117. Universal Human : Creating Authentic Power and the New Consciousness
Gary Zukav, 2021

The Seat of the Soul shows us step-by-fascinating-step how to create a life of love and where that now leads. Universal Human gives us new tools to grow spiritually and shows us how to transform everyday experiences of hopelessness, emptiness, and pain into fulfillment, meaning, and joy.

It points us toward a startling new destination (a species that is beyond culture, religion, nation, ethnic group, and gender a species whose allegiance is to Life first and all else second) and shows us how to get there. Universal Human examines our disintegrating social structures and the new social structures that are replacing them. It shows us a new creation story (our new creation story—as we create it with our choices, our deeds, and our words. A new human consciousness is replacing the old human consciousness. Authentic power—the alignment of the personality with soul) is replacing external power, the ability to manipulate and control. Author explains that the potential of a new era of humanity based on love instead of fear is upon us, but only we can bring it into being. Universal Human shows us how.
