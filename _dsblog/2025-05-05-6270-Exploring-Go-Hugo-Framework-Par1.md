# Exploring go Hugo Framework for SSG

Hugo is a fast and flexible open-source static site generator written in Go, designed to help developers build modern websites quickly without relying on databases or heavy server-side frameworks. It uses simple Markdown files for content, supports powerful templating and theming systems, and can generate entire websites in milliseconds. With features like built-in live reload, content organization, internationalization, and Hugo Modules for reusable components, it's ideal for blogs, documentation sites, portfolios, and even complex multi-language websites. Hugo integrates easily with platforms like GitHub Pages and Netlify, making it a popular choice for developers seeking performance, simplicity, and portability in their web projects.

Would you like a version of this tailored for use in a README or presentation slide?


## Hugo Project Structure with Hugo Modules

Assume you have a site for a project like Agones, and your directory looks like this:

```
agones/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ site/   <- Your Hugo site root
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.toml
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layouts/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ static/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ themes/   <- Can be empty if using Hugo Modules
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ go.mod    <- Created by `hugo mod init`
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cmd/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pkg/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

After running:

```bash
cd agones/site
hugo mod init github.com/googleforgames/agones/site
```

You‚Äôll get this inside `site/go.mod`:

```go
module github.com/googleforgames/agones/site

go 1.20
```


## What is purpose of cmd and pkg folder?
These are conventions in Go projects, not specific to Hugo, but useful when your Hugo site is part of a larger Go monorepo, like agones.

cmd/:
Contains entry points (main packages) for Go binaries. Each subfolder usually builds to a separate binary.
Example: cmd/controller/, cmd/allocator/

pkg/:
Contains reusable Go packages that can be imported by cmd/ or other modules.
Example: pkg/apis/, pkg/util/

üü° Note: You typically don't need these unless you're doing Go development in parallel with the Hugo site (as in the case of Agones).


## Should I run `go` build from site directory?
No, not for building the Hugo site.

go build is for building Go binaries ‚Äî not for generating static websites.

‚úÖ To build the Hugo site, run:

hugo   
(from the site/ directory)

This will use config.toml and the content/, layouts/, static/ folders to generate the final website.


## Where the build process the put the output?
By default, Hugo generates your static website into a folder named:


public/   
So after running:

hugo   
You'll get:


site/  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/  
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html  
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ css/  
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ js/  
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...  

You can change the output directory like this:  

hugo -d ../build_output/


## Can hugo website be published on github?

Yes! You can publish it on GitHub Pages:

**Option A: GitHub Pages (User or Project)**

Generate the site:

hugo  
Push the contents of the public/ folder to the gh-pages branch (or main, if using GitHub Pages defaults).

In GitHub:

Go to Settings > Pages

Select source as gh-pages branch (or main), and directory as / (root)

üîó Tip: You can use GitHub Actions to automate the deployment.


## What needs to be done to publish the website on Netlify?
Netlify makes Hugo deployment very easy:

Steps:
- Push your Hugo site to a GitHub repo.
- Go to Netlify and:
	- Click "Add new site"
	- Choose "Import from GitHub"
	- Select your Hugo repo
- In build settings:
	- Build command: hugo
	- Publish directory: public
- Click Deploy site
- Netlify will:
	- Clone your repo
	- Run the build
	- Serve your site with HTTPS, CDN, and more

üéØ Bonus: You can set environment variables like HUGO_VERSION if needed.


## How to manage different branch for publishing website?
When working on Hugo project like 'Agones' and I push my project into github then it will go into main branch. Should I push public folder also? How to make sure that content of a specific folder (public) go to gh-branch and nothing else.

### Should you push the public/ folder to the main branch?
No, you should not push the public/ folder to the main branch.

main branch should only contain your Hugo source files (content, config, layouts, etc.)

The public/ folder is the generated output and should go to a separate branch, typically gh-pages, for GitHub Pages to serve.

### How to push only the public/ folder to the gh-pages branch?
You can automate this with a few methods. Below is the most straightforward manual + scriptable approach:

**Method 1: Manual (once or occasionally)**  
From your site/ directory (after running hugo):

Navigate to the public folder   
cd public

Initialize a separate Git repo in public/   
git init   
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/[your-repo].git

Switch to the gh-pages branch   
git checkout -b gh-pages

Commit and push the contents  
git add .  
git commit -m "Deploy site to GitHub Pages"  
git push --force origin gh-pages  

‚úÖ This will push only the contents of public/ to gh-pages.

**Method 2: Use a Deployment Script**  
You can automate it using a shell script like this:

Build the site   
hugo

**Go to public folder**   
cd public

**Init a temporary repo**   
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:[your-username]/[your-repo].git
git checkout -b gh-pages

**Commit and force push**
git add .  
git commit -m "Publishing to gh-pages"  
git push --force origin gh-pages  

**Cleanup**
cd ..
rm -rf public/.git
Make sure it‚Äôs executable:


**Create a script .github/workflows/deploy.yml**  
```
name: Deploy Hugo site to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
    - main  # Trigger on push to main branch

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repo
    uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Setup Hugo
    uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2
    with:
    hugo-version: '0.125.4'  # Update to your required version

    - name: Build site
    run: hugo --minify

    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
    uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
    with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    publish_dir: ./public
    publish_branch: gh-pages

```

chmod +x deploy.sh

Then run:

./deploy.sh


## üß© Why Use Hugo Modules?

Instead of manually downloading or including themes and components, you can:

### ‚úÖ Import a theme like this in `config.toml`:

```toml
[module]
  [[module.imports]]
    path = "github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke"
```

### ‚úÖ Hugo will download the theme as a Go module:

```bash
hugo mod get
```

No more git submodules or manual copying! It's clean, version-controlled, and reproducible.

---

### üîÅ Updating Modules

You can later run:

```bash
hugo mod tidy   # Clean up unused modules
hugo mod get -u   # Update all modules
```


## What are frequently used hugo commands?

Here are the **most frequently used Hugo commands**, grouped by purpose, to help you manage your site efficiently:

---

### üöÄ Development & Preview

| Command   | Description    |
| --- | --- |
| `hugo server`   | Starts a local development server at `http://localhost:1313`. Watches for changes. |
| `hugo server -D`    | Also includes **draft** content. Useful when working on unpublished posts.   |
| `hugo server --disableFastRender` | Reloads full site on changes; helpful if partial rebuilds misbehave.   |

---

### üèóÔ∏è Build & Deployment

| Command    | Description    |
| --- | --- |
| `hugo`   | Builds the site into the `public/` folder. |
| `hugo -D`    | Includes drafts during build.    |
| `hugo -d ../output-folder` | Changes the default output directory.    |
| `hugo --minify`    | Minifies HTML/CSS/JS for production.   |

---

### üß∞ Module Commands (for Hugo Modules)

| Command   | Description   |
| --- | --- |
| `hugo mod init <module-path>` | Initializes the site as a Hugo module.  |
| `hugo mod get`    | Downloads all module dependencies.    |
| `hugo mod tidy`   | Cleans up unused modules from `go.mod`. |
| `hugo mod graph`    | Visualizes module dependencies.   |

---

### üìù Content Creation

| --- | --- |
| `hugo new posts/my-post.md`   | Creates a new content file with front matter.    |
| `hugo new content/about/index.md` | Creates a new page bundle (useful for sections). |

---

### üß™ Troubleshooting & Utilities

| Command    | Description   |
| --- | --- |
| `hugo config`  | Shows merged config from all files and environments.    |
| `hugo env`   | Shows Hugo version, OS, module path, etc. Useful for debugging. |
| `hugo version` | Displays installed Hugo version.    |

---



## What does this command does

```bash
hugo mod init github.com/googleforgames/agones/site
```

initializes a **Hugo Module** in your current Hugo site directory with the specified module path:
`github.com/googleforgames/agones/site`.

Here's a breakdown of what it does:

### ‚úÖ What It Does:

1. **Initializes Hugo Modules** in the current site folder (if not already initialized).
2. **Creates a `go.mod` file** with the module path `github.com/googleforgames/agones/site`, used to manage Hugo modules with Go Modules under the hood.
3. **Prepares the site for using themes or components as Hugo modules**, which can then be fetched, versioned, and updated using Go tooling (`hugo mod get`, etc.).
4. This setup is useful especially when:

   * You're working on a **Hugo site that's part of a larger GitHub repo** (like Agones).
   * You want to **import themes or shared components** via Go module paths instead of submodules or manual copying.

---

### üìÅ Example Output:

It will generate a `go.mod` file like:

```go
module github.com/googleforgames/agones/site

go 1.20

require (
    github.com/some/theme v1.0.0
)
```

This tells Hugo and Go which module your site represents and what dependencies it may have.




## What are pupular hugo modules? where are stored in directory structure? How to use them?
Hugo Modules are a powerful way to **reuse components like themes, partials, shortcodes, or entire content structures** across multiple Hugo projects.

Hugo Modules are a **Go Modules-based system** that allows you to:

* Import **themes**, **partials**, **shortcodes**, and **assets** as dependencies.
* Version and manage them cleanly.
* Share and reuse code easily across sites.

They're declared in `config.toml` (or `config.yaml`) and managed via `go.mod`.

---

### üî• Popular Hugo Modules

Here are some widely used Hugo modules:

| Module   | Description    |
| --- | --- |
| [`github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke`](https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke) | A popular starter theme, good for beginners.   |
| [`github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal`](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal)   | A terminal-style blog theme.   |
| [`github.com/dzello/reveal-hugo`](https://github.com/dzello/reveal-hugo)   | A theme/module for creating slides with Reveal.js. |
| [`github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder`](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder)   | Clean and minimal theme for developers.    |
| [`github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book`](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book)   | A theme used for documentation sites.    |

---

### üìÅ Where Are Hugo Modules Stored?

Hugo modules are not stored directly inside your project unless you **vendor** them.

They are:

* Downloaded to your Go module cache (usually `~/go/pkg/mod/`)
* **Mounted virtually** into your site at build/runtime

But if you vendor them (for reproducibility):

```bash
hugo mod vendor
```

Then they go into:

```
/my-hugo-site/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ themes/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <module contents>
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ go.mod
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ go.sum
```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use Hugo Modules?

**üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step**

1. **Initialize module (if not already):**

```bash
hugo mod init github.com/yourname/yoursite
```

2. **Add a theme or module as a dependency:**

```toml
# config.toml
theme = ["github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke"]
```

Or in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
theme:
  - github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke
```

3. **(Optional) Mount parts of the module:**

```toml
[module]
  [[module.mounts]]
    source = "assets"
    target = "assets"

  [[module.mounts]]
    source = "layouts"
    target = "layouts"
```

4. **Run Hugo:**

```bash
hugo server
```

If everything is correct, Hugo fetches and mounts the module.

5. **(Optional) Vendor your modules:**

```bash
hugo mod vendor
```

This copies the module code into `themes/` and avoids downloading on every build.

---

### üìå Useful Hugo Module Commands

```bash
hugo mod init github.com/your/module   # Initialize
hugo mod get   # Fetch new deps
hugo mod tidy    # Clean unused deps
hugo mod vendor    # Copy modules into /themes
hugo mod graph   # Show dependency tree
```

## What is hugo pipeline and how to use this?
In Hugo, the **Hugo Pipes** (or Hugo Asset Pipeline) refers to a built-in feature for processing and optimizing assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images during site generation. It‚Äôs particularly useful when you're working with themes like **Docsy** or building custom layouts that need dynamic asset handling.

---

### üîß What Hugo Pipes Can Do

Hugo Pipes can:

1. **Concatenate files** (e.g., bundle multiple CSS/JS files).
2. **Minify** CSS/JS to reduce file size.
3. **Fingerprint** files (hashing to enable cache busting).
4. **Compile Sass/SCSS** to CSS.
5. **Process images** (resize, crop, convert format).

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Example Use in `baseof.html` (SCSS pipeline)

Here‚Äôs a common Hugo Pipes pipeline used in a theme like **Docsy**:

```gohtml
{{ $options := dict "targetPath" "css/styles.css" }}
{{ $styles := resources.Get "scss/styles.scss" | toCSS $options | minify | fingerprint }}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ $styles.RelPermalink }}" integrity="{{ $styles.Data.Integrity }}">
```

**What this does:**

* `resources.Get` loads the SCSS file.
* `toCSS` compiles SCSS to CSS.
* `minify` reduces CSS file size.
* `fingerprint` adds a content hash for cache busting.
* `RelPermalink` creates the final link.
* `integrity` supports Subresource Integrity (SRI).

---

### üîÅ JavaScript Pipeline Example

```gohtml
{{ $js := resources.Get "js/main.js" | minify | fingerprint }}
<script src="{{ $js.RelPermalink }}" integrity="{{ $js.Data.Integrity }}"></script>
```

---

### üß™ Image Processing Example

```gohtml
{{ $image := resources.Get "images/example.jpg" | images.Resize "600x" }}
<img src="{{ $image.RelPermalink }}" width="{{ $image.Width }}" height="{{ $image.Height }}">
```

---

### ‚úÖ Requirements

* **Hugo Extended** version (needed for SCSS support).
* Your assets should be in the `assets/` directory (not `static/`).
* Place these pipelines inside your `layouts/_default/baseof.html` or any other template file.

---

### üìÅ Folder Structure for Hugo Pipes

```
my-site/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ js/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.js
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scss/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.scss
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layouts/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ _default/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ baseof.html
```

---



## What is purpose of static and assets folder in hugo project?


### ‚úÖ **Hugo Assets vs Static Folder ‚Äî In a Nutshell**

**üóÇÔ∏è `assets/` folder**

* **Use it when you want Hugo to process the files** during the build (via Hugo Pipes).
* Examples:

  * Compile SCSS to CSS
  * Minify JavaScript
  * Resize or optimize images
  * Fingerprint files for cache busting
* These files are **not directly accessible** via URL.
* The transformed output is **automatically placed into the `public/` folder** during build.

**üìÅ `static/` folder**

* **Use it for raw files** that don‚Äôt need processing.
* Examples:

  * Plain images (`.jpg`, `.png`)
  * Ready-made CSS/JS files
  * Fonts or downloadable PDFs
* These files are **copied as-is to the `public/` folder** and are directly accessible via `/filename.ext`.
* Faster build time, since Hugo doesn‚Äôt touch them.

---

## üöÄ Rule of Thumb

> üß† **‚ÄúIf transformation is needed ‚Üí `assets/`. If it‚Äôs ready to serve ‚Üí `static/`.‚Äù**



## What format is better hugo.toml or hugo.yaml?
Both `config.toml` and `config.yaml` work equally well in Hugo ‚Äî **the choice depends on your preference** or your team's conventions. Here's a comparison to help you decide:

---

### ‚úÖ TOML (default & popular)

**Pros:**

* **Default** in Hugo documentation and starter templates.
* Simple, clean syntax for small to medium configs.
* Better for nested tables (hierarchical data).

**Example:**

```toml
baseURL = "https://example.com"
languageCode = "en-us"
title = "My Hugo Site"

[params]
  author = "Alice"
  description = "A cool site"
```

---

### ‚úÖ YAML (more common in DevOps)

**Pros:**

* Familiar to people from DevOps, CI/CD, or Kubernetes backgrounds.
* Great for complex structured data.
* Many IDEs support auto-completion and linting.

**Example:**

```yaml
baseURL: "https://example.com"
languageCode: "en-us"
title: "My Hugo Site"

params:
  author: "Alice"
  description: "A cool site"
```

### Summary

| Feature         | TOML                 | YAML             |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- |
| Hugo default    | ‚úÖ Yes                | ‚ùå No             |
| Readability     | ‚úÖ Simple             | ‚úÖ Human-friendly |
| Best for        | Hugo, simple configs | Complex nesting  |
| Community usage | Common in Hugo       | Common in DevOps |



**üîÑ You can also use JSON**

Hugo also supports `config.json`, but it‚Äôs rarely used due to verbosity.


**üí° Tip:** If you're using multiple environments (`config.production.toml`, etc.), stick with one format for consistency.
