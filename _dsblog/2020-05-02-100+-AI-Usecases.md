Nowadays we are listening and reading a lot about AI and its role in shaping our present and future. But many people, sometimes even technology savvy people, are struggling to understand and answer the following questions.

*   What is AI (Artificial Intelligence)? Is it new technology jargon around?

But they are not able to figure out what are the possible opportunities.

I manage a very active WhatsApp group “AI&BusinessTrends” of and passionate AI enthusiasts. In this group, we played one game “Planting AI in my Field”. In this game, members participated actively and generated many ideas.

In this article, I am putting these ideas together. A list of the people who contributed is mentioned at the end of this article. They can be contacted via their LinkedIn account. The objective of writing this article is to help you think about what all is possible using AI and what possibly you can do. If you want to share more ideas or refine the existing ones then please join our group or comment below. The following questions are not answered in this article and left for readers to explore. 

*   What will be the benefits of these systems or ideas?
