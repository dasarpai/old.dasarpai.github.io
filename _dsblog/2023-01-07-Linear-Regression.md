# Linear Regression Interview Questions and Answers

## What is linear regression? What is the difference between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression?

Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is used to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.

In a simple linear regression model, there is only one independent variable. The relationship between the dependent and independent variables is modeled using a linear equation of the form:

$$ y = b_0 + b_1 * x $$

where y is the dependent variable, x is the independent variable, b0 is the intercept term, and b1 is the slope of the regression line.

for example
$$ Salary = 50,000 + 1.3 * Relevant\_Experience$$

In a multiple linear regression model, there are multiple independent variables. The relationship between the dependent and independent variables is modeled using a linear equation of the form:

$$ y = b_0 + b_1 * x_1 + b_2 * x_2 + ... + b_n * x_n $$

where y is the dependent variable, $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ are the independent variables, b0 is the intercept term, and b1, b2, ..., bn are the regression coefficients for the independent variables.

for example 
$$ Salary = 50,000 + 1.3 * Relevant\_Experience +  5 * number\_of\_projects\_completed + .3 * Age $$

Linear regression is used to analyze the relationship between variables, make predictions, and understand the impact of one or more independent variables on the dependent variable. It is a widely used and well-understood statistical method that is easy to implement and interpret.

## How do you choose the right features for a linear regression model?

There are several approaches you can take when choosing the features for a linear regression model. Here are a few tips:
1. Start with a small set of features: It's easier to understand the relationship between a small number of features and the target variable, and it will also make it easier to visualize the data.
2. Select features that are correlated with the target variable: You want to include features that are likely to have a strong influence on the target variable. You can identify these by calculating the correlation between each feature and the target variable.
3. Avoid highly correlated features: If two features are highly correlated, they may be redundant and only add noise to the model. It is multi-colinearity issue.
4. Consider using feature selection techniques: There are several techniques that can help you select the most important features for your model, such as backward selection, forward selection, and recursive feature elimination.
5. Think about the interpretability of the model: It's often helpful to include features that are easy to understand and interpret in the model, even if they might not be the most predictive on their own.
6. It's also important to keep in mind that the choice of features will depend on the specific problem you are trying to solve and the data you have available. It may be helpful to try out different combinations of features and see how they impact the performance of the model.

## How do you handle multicollinearity in linear regression?

If two features are showing high correlation then you can drop any of those.

----

## How do you evaluate the performance of a linear regression model?

There are several metrics that can be used to evaluate the performance of a linear regression model. Some of these are error based and some are explainablity based. In error based model we calculate error/deviation of the results of a model  from the ground truth. In explainability based model we check how much variation, between predicted value and ground truth value, can be explained by the model.

1. Mean Squared Error (MSE): MSE is the average of the squared differences between the predicted values and the true values. A smaller MSE indicates a better fit of the model.

2. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): RMSE is the square root of the MSE. It is often used because it is in the same units as the target variable, which makes it easier to interpret.

3. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): MAE is the average of the absolute differences between the predicted values and the true values. It is less sensitive to outliers than MSE.

4. R-squared: R-squared is a measure of how well the model fits the data. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect fit.

4. Adjusted R-squared: Adjusted R-squared is similar to R-squared, but it adjusts for the number of features in the model. This can be helpful in cases where you have a large number of features and want to identify the most important ones.

It's important to keep in mind that no single metric is a perfect measure of model performance, and you should consider using multiple metrics to get a more complete picture. Additionally, the choice of metric will depend on the specific problem you are trying to solve and the nature of the data.

## What is the difference bewteen recursive feature elimination (RFE) and backward selection?

Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and backward selection are both feature selection techniques that can be used to identify the most important features in a dataset. The main difference between the two is how they go about selecting features:

Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE): RFE is a recursive process that involves training a model. In this technique you need to tell algorithm that how many features you want to select. It will select features from dataset and build the model multiple time till the time number of requested good features are not identified. In each step it will drop a weak feature.

Backward Selection: Backward selection involves starting with all of the features in the data set and then iteratively removing the least important features one by one until the desired number of features is reached. When you will stop dropping features, it depends upon what results you wanted.

Both RFE and backward selection can be used to identify the most important features in a data set, but RFE is more computationally expensive because it involves training a model multiple times. On the other hand, backward selection is a more efficient process because it only requires training the model once. Ultimately, the choice between the two will depend on the specific problem you are trying to solve and the computational resources you have available.

## What are some assumptions of linear regression?

Linear regression is a statistical technique that is used to model the linear relationship between a response variable and one or more predictor variables. There are several assumptions that must be met in order for the results of a linear regression analysis to be valid. These assumptions are:

- Linearity: The relationship between the predictor variables and the response variable must be linear.
- Independence of errors: The errors (i.e., residuals) must be independent of one another.
- Homoscedasticity: The variance of the errors should be constant across all predicted values.
- Normality: The errors should be normally distributed.
- Absence of multicollinearity: The predictor variables should not be highly correlated with each other.

It is important to check for these assumptions before performing a linear regression analysis, as violating these assumptions can lead to invalid or misleading results.

## Can you explain the concept of ANOVA and how it is used to compare the fit of multiple linear regression models?

ANOVA, or analysis of variance, is a statistical technique that is used to compare the fit of multiple models. It is particularly useful when you want to compare the fit of multiple linear regression models, as it allows you to determine whether there are significant differences in the fits of the models.

In the context of multiple linear regression, ANOVA is used to determine whether the addition of additional predictor variables significantly improves the fit of the model. This is done by comparing the fit of the full model, which includes all of the predictor variables, to the fit of a reduced model, which includes only a subset of the predictor variables.

To perform ANOVA in the context of multiple linear regression, you can use the following steps:

- Fit a multiple linear regression model using all of the predictor variables.
- Calculate the sum of squares for the full model, which is a measure of the total variation in the response variable.
- Fit a multiple linear regression model using only a subset of the predictor variables.
- Calculate the sum of squares for the reduced model, which is a measure of the variation in the response variable that is not explained by the predictor variables in the reduced model.
- Calculate the difference between the sum of squares for the full model and the sum of squares for the reduced model. This difference is known as the "explained sum of squares."
- Calculate the F-statistic, which is the ratio of the explained sum of squares to the residual sum of squares. The F-statistic is used to determine whether the improvement in the fit of the full model compared to the reduced model is statistically significant.

If the F-statistic is large and statistically significant, it indicates that the full model is a significantly better fit than the reduced model, and that the additional predictor variables are contributing significantly to the model's ability to predict the response variable.

## How do you use linear regression to perform partial least squares regression?

Partial least squares (PLS) regression is a type of regression analysis that is used to analyze the relationship between a set of predictor variables and a response variable, while simultaneously considering the interrelationships among the predictor variables. **It is particularly useful in cases where there are a large number of predictor variables and the relationships between the variables are complex.**

PLS regression is a multivariate method that combines the ideas of **PCA** and **MLR**. It is similar to multiple linear regression, in that it is used to predict the value of a response variable based on the values of a set of predictor variables. However, unlike multiple linear regression, PLS regression does not assume that the predictor variables are independent of each other. Instead, it takes into account the interrelationships among the predictor variables and uses this information to improve the prediction of the response variable.

To perform PLS regression, you can use linear regression as follows:

1. Standardize the predictor variables and the response variable. This is done to ensure that all variables are on the same scale, which can improve the accuracy of the PLS model.
2. Create a matrix of the standardized predictor variables, and a vector of the standardized response variable.
3. Use principal component analysis to reduce the number of dimensions in the predictor variable matrix. This is done to simplify the model and reduce the risk of overfitting.
4. Use linear regression to fit a model using the reduced predictor variable matrix and the response variable vector.

Use the PLS model to make predictions for new data points.

## Can you explain the concept of a partial correlation coefficient and how it is used in multiple linear regression?

A partial correlation coefficient is a statistical measure of the correlation between two variables, **taking into account the influence of one or more additional variables**. It is used to measure the degree of association between two variables while controlling for the effects of other variables.

In multiple linear regression, partial correlation coefficients can be used to identify the unique contribution of each predictor variable to the response variable, after adjusting for the influence of the other predictor variables. This can be useful for understanding the relationships between the variables and for selecting the most important predictors for the model.

The partial correlation coefficient between two variables X and Y, controlling for a third variable Z, is calculated as the Pearson correlation coefficient between X and Y, after adjusting for the influence of Z. The formula for calculating the partial correlation coefficient is:

$\rho_{X,Y|Z} = \frac{\rho_{X,Y} - \rho_{X,Z} \cdot \rho_{Y,Z}}{\sqrt{(1 - \rho_{X,Z}^2)(1 - \rho_{Y,Z}^2)}}$

$\rho \,\, is Pearson\_correlation\_coefficient$

It's important to keep in mind that the partial correlation coefficient is sensitive to the choice of control variables, and the interpretation of the coefficient may change depending on the variables that are controlled for.

## How do you use linear regression to perform principal component regression?
**Answer** Principal Component Regression (PCR) is a statistical technique that combines principal component analysis (PCA) with linear regression. It is used to reduce the dimensionality of the data and to improve the interpretability of the model.

Here is a general outline of how to perform PCR:

- Preprocess the data: This may include imputing missing values, scaling the features, and handling categorical variables.

- Perform PCA: Use PCA to identify the principal components in the data. You can specify the number of components to keep based on the amount of variance you want to preserve in the data.

- Train a linear regression model: Use the principal components as the features in a linear regression model and train the model on the data.

- Evaluate the model: Use one or more metrics to evaluate the performance of the model.

PCR can be a useful technique when you have a large number of features and want to create the best model. If you don't do PCR you may endup having an high variance model. The problem with this approach is, you will lose the model interpretability.

## How many types of correlation coeffienct are there in stats?

There are several types of correlation coefficients that are commonly used in statistics to measure the **strength** and **direction of a linear relationship** between two variables. Here are a few of the most common ones:

1. Pearson correlation coefficient: The Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a strong negative relationship, 0 indicates no relationship, and 1 indicates a strong positive relationship.

2. Spearman rank correlation coefficient: The Spearman rank correlation coefficient is a nonparametric measure of the strength of the monotonic relationship between two variables. It is calculated based on the ranks of the values rather than the raw data.

3. Kendall rank correlation coefficient: The Kendall rank correlation coefficient is another nonparametric measure of the strength of the monotonic relationship between two variables. It is calculated based on the number of concordant and discordant pairs in the data.

4. Partial correlation coefficient: The partial correlation coefficient is a measure of the correlation between two variables, taking into account the influence of one or more additional variables.

5. Intraclass correlation coefficient: The intraclass correlation coefficient is a measure of the degree of agreement between observations that are made on the same subjects. It is commonly used in the analysis of repeated measures data.

It's important to choose the appropriate correlation coefficient based on the nature of the data and the type of relationship you are interested in.

## What is concordant or discordant pairs?

Concordant pairs are two variables that tend to increase or decrease together. Discordant pairs, on the other hand, are two variables that tend to move in opposite directions. For example, a positive correlation between the number of hours studied and exam scores would be an example of a concordant pair, while a negative correlation between the number of hours studied and the number of hours spent playing video games would be an example of a discordant pair.

----

## What is monotonic relationship?

A monotonic relationship is a statistical relationship between two variables in which one variable either increases or decreases consistently as the other variable increases. In other words, there is a clear direction to the relationship, but **the relationship may not necessarily be linear**.

For example, consider the relationship between temperature and ice cream sales. As temperature increases, ice cream sales are likely to increase as well. This is a positive monotonic relationship, because one variable (temperature) increases consistently as the other variable (ice cream sales) increases. On the other hand, if temperature were to decrease as ice cream sales increased, the relationship would be **negative monotonic**.

Monotonic relationships can be measured using **nonparametric statistical techniques**, such as the **Spearman rank correlation coefficient** or the **Kendall rank correlation coefficient**. These techniques are based on the ranks of the values rather than the raw data, and they are less sensitive to deviations from a linear relationship than parametric techniques such as the Pearson correlation coefficient.

## what is the difference between nonparametric measure vs parametric measure?

Parametric measures are statistical techniques that make assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data. These assumptions are usually about the shape of the distribution and the presence of certain statistical properties, such as a normal distribution or constant variance. Let's say we have a dataset which contains Paleontology  information about various objects. It has one column called age of the object. Can you assume the age column will have normal distribution? I think no. But if we were having an employee dataset and age is mentioned there then you can assume that age will have normal distriubtion. 

Nonparametric measures, on the other hand, do not make any assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data. They are more flexible and can be used with a wider range of data types, but they may be less powerful than parametric measures because they make fewer assumptions about the data.

One of the main differences between parametric and nonparametric measures is the way they handle missing data. Parametric measures typically require complete data sets, while nonparametric measures are more robust to missing data.

It's important to choose the appropriate statistical technique based on the nature of the data and the research question you are trying to answer. In general, parametric measures are more powerful when the assumptions they make about the data are met, but nonparametric measures may be more appropriate when these assumptions are not met.

## What is R-Square formula?
R-Square or $R^2$ is also called coefficient of determination. It is used to evaluate the performance of regression model. $R^2$ value can be any number between 0 and 1 including 0 and 1. If $R^2$ of a model is .80 then it means this model explain 80% variation between actual and predicted values but 20% variation cannot be explained. Higher the $R^2$ value means more variation can be explained by the model and better the model is.

$$R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}}$$

Where SSres is the sum of squared residuals (the difference between the predicted value and the actual value) and SStot is the total sum of squares (the difference between the actual value and the mean of all actual values).

## What is Adjusted R-Square formula?
$$Adjusted R^2 = 1 - (1 - R^2) * \frac{(n - 1)}{(n - p - 1)}$$
