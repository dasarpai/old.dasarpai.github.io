# Computer Vision Research Work

When we talk about "Vision" capabilities most of the people don't understand how complex is brain in processing those visual spectrum (light signals) raditions. What kind of processings are happening inside our brain through which we understand color, depth, motion, speed, segments, objects, scenes, different kinds of arts, drawings, culture, etc. Until recently when "computer vision" became a serious work in AI only nerology researchers, surgens and brain specilitist were having some ideas. But, sinece 2012 (Alexnet Paper) we every month some new paper is published we come to know how far we come in computer vision. This article is not only the chronology of Computer Vision but also of software engineers, computer scientists, AI enginners, and everyone who want to know how their phone does certain things and become intelligent.
