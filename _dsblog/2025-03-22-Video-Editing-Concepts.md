# üé¨ **Core Video Editing Concepts**

A **comprehensive list of features and concepts** that are useful to understand in **any video editing software**, whether you're using Shotcut, OBS Studio, Adobe Premiere, DaVinci Resolve, Final Cut Pro, or any other. When I was working on a project that required me to explore this, it was overwhelming for me to remember and apply all of these concepts. Therefore, I thought of sharing this with others who are starting their journey.

## What are the different kinds of filter in video and audio editing?
Filters in video and audio editing help enhance, correct, or transform content creatively or technically. Here's a breakdown of the **different kinds of filters** used in **video** and **audio editing** along with short explanations:

---

### **Video Filters**

1. **Color Correction Filters** ‚Äì Adjust brightness, contrast, saturation, and white balance to correct color issues.

2. **Color Grading Filters** ‚Äì Apply stylized looks using LUTs (Look-Up Tables) to set mood or cinematic tone.

3. **Blur Filters** ‚Äì Soften parts of the video (e.g., Gaussian blur) to reduce detail or create depth.

4. **Sharpen Filters** ‚Äì Increase edge contrast to make video appear crisper.

5. **Noise Reduction Filters** ‚Äì Remove grain or static caused by low-light or poor camera quality.

6. **Chroma Key (Green Screen) Filters** ‚Äì Replace solid-colored backgrounds with another video or image.

7. **Vignette Filters** ‚Äì Darken edges of the frame to draw focus to the center.

8. **Lens Distortion Filters** ‚Äì Simulate camera lens effects like fisheye or wide-angle warping.

9. **Stabilization Filters** ‚Äì Reduce shaky footage for smoother playback.

10. **Glitch Effects** ‚Äì Add distortion, pixelation, or VHS-style interference for a digital/retro look.

11. **Slow Motion / Speed Ramping** ‚Äì Adjust playback speed for dramatic or comedic effect.
