# Types of Questions
Question-Answering task is one of the tasks in NLP-Task. To create a high-performing AI system that can understand the question correctly and answer appropriately, we need to train a model. And to train a model, we need to have a good-quality dataset in place. Without understanding what are the different formats of questions and answers, we cannot create a dataset. In our day-to-day life we never pay attention to this minute detail but to create an AI system that can perform QA tasks, we need to understand the different formats of questions. In this article, I am creating a list of these different types of questions. To create an AI system that can perform all these kinds of QA tasks, we need to craft the dataset very carefully. Although, we see lots of data around, but to create an NLP-Task specific dataset is tedious task.

1. Closed-ended Questions:

    These questions have a limited set of predefined answer options, often requiring a simple "yes" or "no" response or a specific choice from a list.

    What is the square root of four?

2. Yes/No Questions:

    These questions are designed to elicit a binary response of "yes" or "no."

    Did you see Mark today?
    Do you want me to call that client?

3. Open-ended Questions:

    Open-ended questions allow for a wide range of responses and encourage more detailed and expressive answers.

4. Factual Questions:

    These questions seek specific, verifiable information. The answers are based on concrete facts.

5. Descriptive Questions:

    Descriptive questions ask for descriptions, explanations, or details about a topic or situation.

6. Comparative Questions:

    Comparative questions involve comparing two or more items, entities, or concepts to identify similarities and differences.

7. Cause-and-Effect Questions:

    Cause-and-effect questions inquire about the reasons behind events or actions and their outcomes.

8. Inferential Questions:

    Inferential questions require respondents to draw conclusions or make inferences based on provided information.

9. Opinion-based Questions:

    Opinion-based questions solicit subjective viewpoints, beliefs, or preferences from respondents.

10. Hypothetical Questions:

    Hypothetical questions ask respondents to consider imaginary scenarios and provide answers based on those scenarios.

11. Rhetorical Questions:

    Rhetorical questions are posed for rhetorical effect and do not necessarily require an answer. They often emphasize a point or provoke thought.

12. Wh-Questions:

    Wh-questions (also known as information questions) typically start with question words like "who," "what," "when," "where," "why," and "how." They seek specific details or explanations.

13. Tag Questions:

    Tag questions are short questions added at the end of a statement to confirm or seek agreement (e.g., "It's a nice day, isn't it?").

14. Direct Questions:

    Direct questions are straightforward inquiries that directly ask for information or clarification.

15. Indirect Questions:

    Indirect questions are phrased as statements but are used to ask for information indirectly (e.g., "I wonder where the park is?").

16. Interview Questions:

    These questions are used in interviews to gather information about a person's background, skills, experiences, or opinions.
    Survey Questions:

    Survey questions are used in research and data collection to gather specific information from respondents.

17. Explanatory Questions:

    Explanatory questions are posed to seek further clarification or elaboration on a previously provided response.

18. Clarifying Questions:

    Clarifying questions seek additional details to better understand a situation, statement, or concept.

19. Leading Questions:

    Leading questions subtly guide respondents toward a particular answer, often by presenting a biased or persuasive viewpoint.

20. Probing Questions:

    Probing questions are used to delve deeper into a topic, encouraging respondents to provide more extensive answers.
