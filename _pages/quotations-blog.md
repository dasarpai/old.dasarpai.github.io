excerpt: "These Quotations come from my reflection from the surface of lake called life. Great teachers like Mahatama Buddha, Lao Tzu, Adi Shankara, Ramakrushna Paramhamsa, Swami Vivekananda, Ramana Maharshi, J D Krishnamurthi, Osho, Sadguru, Swami Dayananda Sarawati, Swami Parmarthananda have shaped my mind and intellect"

# Welcome to Wisdom in Awareness Quotations!

In today's information age, when we have lots of data and information. When most of us have lost the ability to read longer text, listen carefully, watch attentively, and think deeper. The most unfortunate tragedy that happened to humanity is they think that they think but the overall ability to think independently and deeper has faded hugely. You may be thinking, that you know so much, and think so much, therefore, whatever coming from your mind is yours. Think again, whatever you think is yours is given to you by those 15-second ads, social media comments, and one-liner quotations from some book or philosopher.

WIA Quotations are my efforts to help my surroundings to think, and think differently. Not as a rebel but as a seeker of the Self. I don't want you to agree with my thoughts and articles, nor do I want you to stand against them. I wish they provoke you and your experience the impact of those words, you think critically and become free from memories of the past, apprehensions of the future, fear of loss, temptations of gain, words of the scriptures, and logic of the philosophers. These quotations are free from positive or negative thinking (there are many people who are doing good work on that theme), and political or religious opinions. No matter how old you are, how much experience you have, and which culture or religion you follow, these quotations can dig deeper into the human psyche. Maybe you find your True self in this reflective process.

Join me on this journey of intellectual liberation, where the power of thought becomes a lamp in a deep dark forest guiding you towards a more profound understanding of yourself and the world around you.
