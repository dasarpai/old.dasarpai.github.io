# Description of Business Domains
Being part of the Software, AI, and Management Consulting industries has given me the opportunity to work across various fields. When organizing my projects by domain, I often find it challenging to place each project in the correct folder/github repo. This can lead to search and configuration management issues later on. I believe many others face similar challenges, which is why I created this page as a way to track my work more easily. By sharing this categorization publicly, I hope it may also benefit others. This is not a formal or standardized classification, and some domain experts may feel that certain areas are not defined perfectly. Iâ€™m aware of this and present it as a practical solution to streamline my workflow.
