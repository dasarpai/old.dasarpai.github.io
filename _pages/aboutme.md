### **KEY DATA SCIENCE PROJECTS**

**(Few Selected Project Out of 30+ Projects)**

**Sarcasm Detection in Hinglish Language \| Tech Stack: Python, PyTorch, mBERT, NLP, FastText, ML, DT \| Nov’20**

*   Objective: Sarcasm Detection in text written in Latin + Devanagari Script and Hindi + English + Indian Languages (popularly called Hinglish). This is my M.Sc. Thesis project.
*   Solution: **Developed** Hinglish Language Sarcasm Dataset. **Developed** custom embedding (BOW, TFIDF, Word2Vec, fastText, Lexical), plus used embedding transfer from IndicFT, fastTextWiki, mBERT, IndicBERT. **Used Task Transfer** from mBERT, IndicBERT, fastTextWiki and **fine tuned** the model with my training data. **Developed** classifier models using Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier, XGBoost Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Peceptron. **Developed** RNN based classifier architecture. **Analyzed** various Embedding Models for Hinglish Text and created 108 models to identify which ML Algorithm, NLP Pretrained Model and which embedding works best for Hinglish language and Sarcasm detection.
*   Key Achievement: Developed the best model with fastTextWiki embedding and Naïve Bayesian classifier gives 76% accuracy, 78% recall, 75% precision, 76% F1 score and 80% AUC. Concluded FastTextWiki embedding along with Naive Bayesian Classifer is the best for Hinglish Language Sarcasm Detection.

  
**Hand Gesture Recognition from Live Stream \| Tech Stack: Python, CV, Keras, CNN, RNN, GRU \| Feb ’20**

*   Objective: Customer wanted to detect 5 hand gesture (left swipe, right swipe, thumbs up, thumbs down, stop) from a camera installed on any TV device so that without using remote control TV can be operated.
*   Solution: Customer supplied 800 short (1-2 second) videos in two formats 360×360 or 120×160. I developed CNN+RNN based 50 models with different architecture. Finally selected a best model which can predict these gestures most correctly.
*   Key Achievement: The best model gave validation accuracy 72%

  
**Driver Availability for the Day. \| Tech Stack: Python, sklearn**

*   Objective: A taxi aggregator want to know how many hours a driver will be available to pick up and drop a customer.
*   Solution: Number of drivers for any taxi aggregator is very stable number, but their demand and availability depends upon the day of week, season, weather condition, festival, events in the city etc. Based on the driver profile, the model predicted number of hours the driver can be available to serve the customer. This information can be used by the aggregator to incentivize drivers and manage dynamic fair.
*   Key Achievement: Developed a model with **R2 of 0.81**

**Creating a Cluster of Countries who need Help International Funding \| Tech Stack: Python, PCA, Hierarchical Clustering, KMean, Silhouette Score, Hopkin Score**

*   Objective: There are 200+ countries on the Earth. All countries are not same in the sense of eco-social affairs. Health International wanted to grant $10 million funds for education and health. We need to suggest 5-10 countries for whom they can allocate their funds.
*   Solution: Based on various socio-economic parameters like GDP, Exports, Imports, PIC, Education, Health, child-mortality, life expectancy etc. we created 5 clusters and selected all countries of a cluster (representing the poorest performance on these eco-social parameters) to recommend for funding.
*   Key Achievement: Created 5 clusters. A list of 5 countries whom the NGO can help.
