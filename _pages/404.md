## Aww, Snap!

Sorry, but the page you were trying to view does not exist --- perhaps you can try searching for it in the search bar?

<div class="container">
  <h1>Error - 404</h1>
  <img src="/assets/images/404.png" alt="404.png" width="25%">

  <p><strong>I am sorry you landed here.</strong></p>
  <p>The requested page could not be found. You can write to me hari@dasarpai.com </p>
</div>
