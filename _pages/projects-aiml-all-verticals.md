# AI/ML - Industries - Developed/ Created/ Expanded work
**Projects in this section are listed according to Industry/Business Domain.**

Sometimes it is difficult for me to find out in what domain a particular project falls into, therefore I have created [this page](/Description-of-Business-Domains) to decide the domain.

### Acea Smart Water Analytics & Prediction
- [Github Repo](https://github.com/dasarpai/DAI-Projects/tree/main/Climate/Acea-Water-Prediction){:TARGET="_BLANK"}
- [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dasarpai/DAI-Projects/blob/main/Climate/Acea-Water-Prediction/acea-smart-water-full-eda-prediction.ipynb){:TARGET="_BLANK"}
- [Acea Water Prediction & Analysis - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/harithapliyal/acea-smart-water-full-eda-prediction){:TARGET="_BLANK"}
- [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/acea-water-prediction){:TARGET="_BLANK"}

**Objective**   
  - The Acea Group deals with four different type of waterbodies: water spring (for which three datasets are provided), lake (for which a dataset is provided), river (for which a dataset is provided) and aquifers (for which four datasets are provided).
  - This competition uses nine different datasets, completely independent and not linked to each other. Each dataset can represent a different kind of waterbody. As each waterbody is different from the other, the related features as well are different from each other.
  - It is of the utmost importance to notice that some features like rainfall and temperature, which are present in each dataset, don’t go alongside the date. Indeed, both rainfall and temperature affect features like level, flow, depth to groundwater and hydrometry some time after it fell down. This means, for instance, that rain fell on 1st January doesn’t affect the mentioned features right the same day but some time later. As we don’t know how many days/weeks/months later rainfall affects these features, this is another aspect to keep into consideration when analyzing the dataset.

### Flight Delay Analysis using Hive
This dataset contains the 2004-2005 flights data from the 2009 ASA Statistical Computing and Graphics Data Expo consisted of flight arrival and departure details for all commercial flights on major carriers within the United States of America from October 1987 to April 2008

Activities (Pipeline) in project: 
- Creating hive table (for storage) from the external files
- Create partition table schema
- Parition hive table based on the year and putting data in partition table.
- Performing sql querries on the partitioned table

### Flight Delay Analysis - 2008 (Bigdata)
The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled and diverted flights appears in DOT's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report, published about 30 days after the month's end, as well as in summary tables posted on this website. 

Apache Hive is a data warehousing and SQL-like query engine built on top of Hadoop. Hadoop has Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). It can handle distributed storage and processing of the data in hand. Hive can handle billions of transactions. We can perform any kind of SQL Query without bothering whether aggregation functions or filter function will be ever completed or not. Hive can handle all CRUD operations.

Dataset contains airlines daily flight information like Origin,Dest, Distance,DepTime, CRSDepTime, ArrTime, CRSArrTime, UniqueCarrier, FlightNum, TailNum, ActualElapsedTime, CRSElapsedTime, AirTime, ArrDelay, DepDelay, TaxiIn, TaxiOut, Cancelled, CancellationCode, Diverted, CarrierDelay, WeatherDelay, NASDelay, SecurityDelay, LateAircraftDelay. Airlines wanted to analyze the of last 20 years.
