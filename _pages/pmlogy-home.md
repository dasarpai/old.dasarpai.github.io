## Hari Thapliyaal

**Using Project Management Values & Principles is the Core of Project Success. Not Just Writing Processes and Theorizing.**

More than a technical and management professional, I feel I am a full life—someone who wants to know everything, who is interested in everything, and who has the ability to penetrate anything, whether it’s the deeper philosophical concepts of Advaita Vedanta, the mysteries of subatomic particles, or the technical aspects of IT application architecture. More than anything else in life, I value my ignorance because it doesn’t allow me to settle. The more Tapasya (austerity to experience life) I do, the more I realize that I am still at the starting point.

I firmly believe in a principle that says one should learn as if they are going to live in this cosmos forever, and at the same time, not be casual and merely touch many things without truly experiencing anything. Work wisely to know everything in existence so that you come to know yourself as an eternal being!

By education, I am a computer programmer; by profession, I have been a project management consultant, coach, and trainer; and by heart, I love data science, philosophy, and long, solitary trekking.

In the last 2.5+ decades in the industry, I have traveled a lot and touched thousands of lives. I have inspired many, and some of these gems have become part of my life.

I recently completed my Master’s in Data Science & AI and following that my Doctorate in Businss Adminstration (NLP/GenAI).

I have trained over 4,000+ people in more than 300 full-day workshops, each ranging from 2 to 7 days, and have trained professionals in India and the APEC region.

I have transformed the way projects and project management offices are managed for dozens of projects and organizations.

I am a seasoned professional in product development and project management in agile project environments.
