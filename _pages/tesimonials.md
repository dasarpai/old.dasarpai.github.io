**Sr Program Manager -Engineering, Product Development, Customer Delivery (PMP)**



I have attended Hari Thapliyal’s training on PMP Exam Preparation. Hari is a highly enthusiastic and very experienced professional with in depth knowledge in Project Management. The way he carried out the training program is very unique, interesting, and motivating. The program is bundled with abstract real-life examples and case studies that helped me gain in-depth knowledge in PMP processes and knowledge areas, able to correlate with real-life scenarios. Hari is really blessed with the art of coaching, training, and a spiritual bent of mind. Hari is very keen on following the student’s learning process and offered valuable inputs during the preparation. I am very thankful for having Hari as my PMP trainer.

**IT Governance & Compliance**



We hired AstroWix for our PMP training in Uninor. It was the first day and the earlier trainer completely collapsed as he failed to connect with a strong group of 25 professionals to provide a structural & organized start to the training, which is actually a key for any trainer.

We asked AstroWix to change the trainer immediately and hence on 2nd day Hari was standing in the training room to take on the challenge. Initially we all were like ….ok let’s see who is this guy and how he manages this big group. Believe me within one hour everybody was just listing to Hari. The way he carried out the program and made very easy to understand & apply in our day to day professional life scenarios, was excellent. His innovative approach and ability to connect with each professional attendee, coming from different work experience and demographic backgrounds, is amazing and beyond comparison. He is a thorough gentleman and a true professional with complete command on the subject. I strongly recommend him for any kind of ‘Project Management’ training/consulting.

**Sr. Analyst Apps Prog @ Bank of America (PMP, PMI-ACP)**



I have attended the PMP workshop conducted by Hari as a part of career management programs arranged by my organization; I am very much thankful and fortunate few to attend Hari’ s PMP training program, that itself helped myself (and also 3 more of my colleagues) to clear PMP certification right away with much ease. It’s Hari’ s unique teaching style of preparing PMP candidates that is very much perceivable only those who actually attended it; I am still remembering how he has adopted the traditional “Gurukul” way of coaching to remember all 42 processes in PMP without having to refer PMBoK.

Not only he makes understand the concepts very clearly, but also he will suggest easy examples from real-time that will make you appreciate the concept that you are learning. There are lots of examples and workouts that he handles during the program, role plays and memorizing techniques that will aid even a beginner in project management to form a strong foundation in his career.

I hereby recommend Hari for his extraordinary training capabilities with PMP and project management related trainings, and wish him a very long and successful career ahead
