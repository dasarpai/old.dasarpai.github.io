# Project Index Page
This is "master project page" therefore it is linking to my different project categories. To know about my work in different domain you can click on the link of your interest.

## Introduction
**This page is about sharing my project work, capabilities, expertise, abilities, understanding about business domain, technology solutions and approaches.**

- This page list all my github repo (private + public). 
- These github repositories are related to all my projects, consulting, courses and POC (proof of concepts), technology explorations.
- This also has listed some imported forked repositories. Some of these I forked to extend the existing one, some I forked for teaching, some were forked to build my solutions.
- These projects are either sharing my Project Management capabilities in different domains including IT.
- These projects ar also discussing my Technology capabilities specially around AI, Deep Learning, GenAI, NLP and Analytics.
- The purpose of this listing is, 
	- to help other's knowing what is possible and what I have explored. 
	- to remind myself what I already have explored and worked vs what didn't work during exploration.

## [AI/ML Datasets](https://github.com/dasarpai/DAI-Datasets)
There is no dearth of datasets but during training sessions when I or my learners need some dataset that we need to struggle for these datasets. Either they are removed ore renamed or internet availablity/restriction etc issue waste lot of time. To avoid that I have created this github repo of datasets. These are for classical machine learning. They are not for deeplearning or LLM, until mentioned specifically.
