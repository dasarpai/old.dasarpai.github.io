# PMBOK 6 Process Explorer

PMI released the 6th Edition of Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) in September 2017. It has 49 processes, across 10 knowledge areas and 5 process groups. How these 49 processes are distributed across different knowledge areas and process groups can be visualized from the table below.

You can use **PMBOK Explore** to drill all the processes till the document and tools detail level. I have taken care of the best from my side but human errors and different interpretations are possible. Please do not hesitate to report if you find any incorrect information or missing information or incorrect interpretation of any process, definition, tools, IO from my end.
