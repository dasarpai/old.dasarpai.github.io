# Building and Deploying Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock

## **Course Objective**
This hands-on Amazon Bedrock workshop is designed to equip participants with in-depth knowledge and practical skills to harness the power of Amazon Bedrock for generative AI applications. Over the course of 2-3 days, participants will gain a foundational understanding of Bedrock's services, learn to configure and integrate its APIs, and customize models to meet specific use cases. By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to build, deploy, and scale generative AI models, applying best practices for performance and cost-efficiency in real-world scenarios.


## **Course Prerequisites**
To maximize the benefit from this workshop, participants should have:
   - **Basic Knowledge of AWS Services**: Familiarity with AWS Console, Identity and Access Management (IAM), and basic AWS services like S3 and Lambda.
   - **Foundational Understanding of Machine Learning**: Knowledge of machine learning concepts and model tuning is recommended but not essential.
   - **Programming Skills**: Experience with Python or another programming language for working with APIs and integrating model calls into applications.
   - **API Basics**: Understanding of API endpoints, authentication, and call handling will be beneficial.


## **What You Will Learn in This Class**
Participants will learn to:
   - Set up, configure, and secure Amazon Bedrock environments
   - Explore and utilize Bedrock’s foundation models for text, image, and chatbot generation
   - Customize and fine-tune foundation models with domain-specific data
   - Integrate Bedrock’s API into applications and automate workflows using AWS services
   - Build an end-to-end generative AI application, including deployment, monitoring, and optimization
   - Scale applications with Amazon Bedrock while optimizing for cost and performance


## **Course Audience**
This workshop is ideal for:
   - **Data Scientists and ML Engineers**: Looking to apply generative AI techniques in their projects using Amazon Bedrock.
   - **Software Developers**: Interested in building and integrating generative AI applications with real-world functionalities.
   - **Cloud Engineers and Architects**: Wanting to understand how Amazon Bedrock fits into the broader AWS ecosystem and how to scale AI workloads.
   - **Business Analysts and Technical Leaders**: Aiming to explore and lead generative AI initiatives using AWS’s powerful Bedrock service.


Each day allows for 6-8 hours of content, including hands-on labs and time for troubleshooting. Adjustments can be made for a 2-day workshop by combining or shortening less technical sections.
