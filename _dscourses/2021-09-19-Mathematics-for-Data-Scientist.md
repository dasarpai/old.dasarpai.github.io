**Mathematical for Data Scientist**

To excel in the field of data science, especially as a data scientist, I would recommend you have good command over the topics mentioned below. There are many YouTube channels that you can use for this purpose. Because this is 10+2 level mathematics, and it is just a matter of revision. So I am not offering any course unless there is a specific need for some group, organization.

## Linear Algebra
*   Introduction to Linear Algebra
*   Eigenvalues And Eigenvectors
*   Calculating Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
*   Eigen decomposition of a Matrix
*   Eigenvectors: What Are They?

## Vectors, Matrices & Linear Transformations
*   Vector & Vector Spaces
*   Vectors: The Basics
*   Basis Vector
*   Norm of a vector
*   Identity matrix or operator
*   Determinant of a matrix
*   Column and Null Space
*   Rank of a matrix
*   Transpose of a matrix
*   Inverse of a matrix
*   Least Squares Approximation
*   Linear Transformations
