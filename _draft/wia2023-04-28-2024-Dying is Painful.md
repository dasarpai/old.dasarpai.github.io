# Dying is Painful?

Dying is very painful for most of the people.

We want to live healthy and never ready to die.

Even if you live 1000 years of life what will you do here on this planet with old body, old memories, thousands of relatives friends and enemies? When you are youth you want to be super busy. You have same routine, make lots of money. After you retire you have lots of money same borring routine. To break the routine and boredom you go to picnic or foreign tour. If you have 1000 years life you will repeat same thing.

Advancement in the Health system, ecosystem due to insurance companies and society doesn't allow a sick person to die. In the name of service to elders, poor, weak, due to God fear people feel bad when they need to let person drop
