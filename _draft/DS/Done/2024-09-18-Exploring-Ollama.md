# Exploring Ollama & LM Studio

## Question: What is Ollama? Is it like Docker?
Ollama is a platform designed to make running and interacting with large language models (LLMs) easier. It abstracts away the complexities of managing LLM models, GPU resources, and related configurations by offering a simple CLI interface. With Ollama, you can run, manage, and deploy LLMs locally or in various cloud environments without having to worry about the intricate details of setting up environments, downloading models, or configuring them.

### Key Features of Ollama:
- **Model Management**: Ollama can download and store LLMs in a local cache for you to run, typically in a format optimized for the hardware available (like your local GPU).
- **GPU/CPU Utilization**: It detects hardware resources, such as your NVIDIA GPU, and automatically uses them for model acceleration without additional setup.
- **Service Setup**: When you install Ollama, it sets up a service running in the background that serves models on an API, so you can interact with them programmatically.

## Question: How is Ollama different from Docker?
While Ollama and Docker both deal with isolated environments, they serve different purposes:

- **Ollama** focuses specifically on running machine learning models, especially large language models, and optimizes resources to make them easily accessible and deployable.
- **Docker** is a general-purpose containerization tool that allows you to package applications with their dependencies in isolated environments. Itâ€™s used for deploying a wide variety of applications, not just models.

So, while Docker might also be used to set up machine learning environments or serve models, Ollama is specialized and optimized for the LLM use case.

In Summary: **Ollama** = Model management platform for LLMs, with easy CLI and automatic resource optimization. **Docker** = General containerization tool for deploying all types of applications in isolated environments.

## Question: How to install ollama on my machine?
Refer: https://ollama.com/download/linux, and https://github.com/ollama/ollama, and https://github.com/ollama/ollama-python
- To download Ollama on linux/wsl:    
	curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
- To run   
	ollama run phi3   
	**<font color=green>http://127.0.0.1:11434/ - ollama is running </font>**

## Question: How to create customized LLM Model (docker like image)?

If you know the working of Docker image, container, docker hub, docker command then you will feel at home with ollama commands.

Step 1: Create a ModelFile
```
FROM llama3.1

# set the temperature to 1 [higher is more creative, lower is more coherent]
PARAMETER temperature 1

# set the system message
SYSTEM """
You are Travel Advisor from Air India Airlines. Answer as AI Advisor, the assistant, only.
"""
```

Step 2: Create and run the model
```
ollama create aiadvisor -f ./Modelfile
ollama run aiadvisor
>>> hi
Hello! It's your friend AI Advisor.
```

## Question: What are the LLM available on ollama?
There are 100+ LLM available via ollama. They have different capabilities in terms of domain task like 
coding, embedding, reasoning, chatting, philosophy, medical, maths, function calling. And in terms of context window 8k, 16k, 24k, 128k etc. And in terms of hardware/gpu required or not to run these.

## Question: What kind of software are LM Studio or Ollama?

Their role is to facilitate easy use of these models by providing a platform that supports multiple models, offering features like local deployment, training, and experimentation without needing to deal with the complex setup each model requires.

They are platform or interface for LLM: Both Ollama and LM Studio are software tools that allow users to interact with, run, fine-tune, and experiment with multiple large language models. They are more like model management tools or LLM execution environments rather than models themselves.

They are Model Hub: These tools serve as hubs where you can load, execute, and work with a variety of pre-trained LLMs. Instead of being limited to one specific model like GPT-4, they allow users to work with models like LLaMA, GPT-3, GPT-4, and others.

They are Model Runners: Since they enable the running and execution of multiple models.

They are LLM Execution/Management Tools: They manage various models and allow you to deploy them.

You can think of them as infrastructure that abstracts away the complexities of working with different LLMs.
