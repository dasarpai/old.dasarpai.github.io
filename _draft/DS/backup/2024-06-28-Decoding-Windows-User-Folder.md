## My machine c:\users folder has 3 users Detault, harip_, public. What is the purpose of these 3 users?

The `C:\Users` folder on a Windows machine contains subfolders for each user profile on the system. Here's an explanation of the purpose of the three users you mentioned: `Default`, `hari_`, and `Public`.

### 1. Default
- **Purpose**: The `Default` user profile is a template used by Windows when creating new user profiles. When a new user account is created on the system, Windows copies the contents of the `Default` profile to set up the new user's profile.
- **Contents**: This folder typically contains the default settings and configuration files that new user profiles will inherit.
- **Location**: `C:\Users\Default`

### 2. harip_
- **Purpose**: This folder is the user profile for the account named `hari_`. It contains personal files, configuration settings, and application data specific to this user.
- **Contents**: It includes folders such as `Documents`, `Downloads`, `Pictures`, `AppData`, and others that store the user's personal files and preferences.
- **Location**: `C:\Users\harip_`

### 3. Public
- **Purpose**: The `Public` user profile is used to share files and folders among all users on the same computer. Any user account on the computer can access the files stored in the `Public` profile.
- **Contents**: It typically contains folders such as `Public Documents`, `Public Downloads`, `Public Music`, `Public Pictures`, and `Public Videos`.
- **Location**: `C:\Users\Public`

### Summary
- **Default**: A template profile used to set up new user accounts.
- **hari_**: A personal profile for the user named `hari_`, containing their personal files and settings.
- **Public**: A shared profile accessible by all users on the computer, used for sharing files among users.

These user profiles help manage and organize user-specific data and settings, ensuring that each user has a personalized experience while using the computer.

## Public folder is confusing. If there is another user on this machine say "ravi" then it will have its own folder like  "hari_" then what is the user of public?

The `Public` folder serves a specific purpose: it provides a common area for sharing files and folders among all users on the same computer. Here's why it's useful:

### Purpose of the Public Folder

1. **Shared Access**:
    - The `Public` folder is accessible to all user accounts on the machine. If there are multiple users (e.g., `hari_` and `ravi`), both can access the `Public` folder and its contents.
    - This makes it easy to share files without needing to set up permissions or use external storage devices.

2. **Collaboration**:
    - When multiple users need to work on the same files or share resources, the `Public` folder provides a convenient location.
    - For example, if `hari_` wants to share a document with `ravi`, `hari_` can place the document in the `Public` folder. `ravi` can then access it from their own user profile.

3. **Accessibility**:
    - Files in the `Public` folder are not tied to any specific user, so they remain accessible even if the user who placed them there is logged out or has been deleted.

### Example Scenario

1. **User Profiles**:
    - `C:\Users\hari_`: Contains `hari_`'s personal files and settings.
    - `C:\Users\ravi`: Contains `ravi`'s personal files and settings.

2. **Public Folder**:
    - `C:\Users\Public`: Contains files and folders intended for sharing.

### How to Use the Public Folder

1. **Placing Files**:
    - `hari_` can copy or move files into `C:\Users\Public\Documents`, `C:\Users\Public\Downloads`, etc.

2. **Accessing Files**:
    - `ravi` can navigate to `C:\Users\Public\Documents` (or other subfolders) and see the files `hari_` placed there.

### Public Folder Structure

The `Public` folder typically contains the following subfolders:

- `Public Documents`
- `Public Downloads`
- `Public Music`
- `Public Pictures`
- `Public Videos`

These subfolders help organize shared files by type, making it easier for users to find and manage shared content.

### Summary

The `Public` folder is useful for:

- **Sharing Files**: Simplifies sharing files among multiple users on the same machine.
- **Collaboration**: Facilitates collaborative work by providing a common space for shared resources.
- **Ease of Access**: Ensures that shared files are easily accessible to all users, regardless of individual user permissions or profiles.

## Under user\harip_ folder there is appdata  folder it has 3 folders local, locallow, roaming. what is the purpose of these?

The `AppData` folder is a hidden system folder in Windows that stores application-specific data and settings. It contains three subfolders: `Local`, `LocalLow`, and `Roaming`. Each of these serves different purposes in terms of data storage and usage. Here's a detailed explanation of each:

### 1. Local

**Path**: `C:\Users\harip_\AppData\Local`

**Purpose**:
- The `Local` folder is used to store data that is specific to the user's computer. This data is not synchronized with other computers if the user logs in from a different machine.
- Applications store settings and files here that are large in size or specific to the current device, such as temporary files, caches, and log files.

**Examples**:
- Temporary internet files
- Application caches
- Browser profiles (like Chrome's user data)
  
### 2. LocalLow

**Path**: `C:\Users\harip_\AppData\LocalLow`

**Purpose**:
- The `LocalLow` folder is similar to the `Local` folder but is used by applications that run with lower integrity levels (less trusted or lower security permissions). This often includes web browsers and other applications that need to run in a more restricted environment.
- It is used for storing data that should remain isolated from other processes for security reasons.

**Examples**:
- Internet Explorer running in Protected Mode stores its data here.
- Some browser plugins and extensions

### 3. Roaming

**Path**: `C:\Users\harip_\AppData\Roaming`

**Purpose**:
- The `Roaming` folder is used to store data that should "roam" with the user profile if they log into different computers within the same domain. This means the data stored here will be available to the user regardless of which machine they log into, provided the network and user account policies allow it.
- Applications store user-specific settings and configurations that need to be available across multiple devices.

**Examples**:
- Email client settings (like Outlook)
- Application settings and preferences (like Adobe products)
- User-specific configurations for various applications

### Summary

- **Local**: For data specific to a single computer and user, typically large or temporary files.
- **LocalLow**: For data that requires lower security permissions, usually for less trusted applications.
- **Roaming**: For data and settings that should be synchronized and available on any machine where the user logs in, within the same network/domain.

### Use Cases

- **Local**: Temporary files, application caches, and logs. For example, a video game might store cache files here.
- **LocalLow**: Data from web browsers running in protected mode or other low-integrity applications. For example, a web browser's low-security extension data.
- **Roaming**: Configuration settings and user preferences that need to be consistent across different machines. For example, email settings, application configurations, and profiles.

Understanding these distinctions helps in managing user profiles and application data effectively, ensuring that applications function correctly and that user preferences are maintained across different systems.
