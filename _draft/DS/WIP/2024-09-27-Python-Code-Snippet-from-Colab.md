If you want to do anything in colab or in python anywhere then don't write code for this. There is rich code snippet available from google colab, you can use these and save your big amount of time. This is very useful for those who are starting there journey and stuggle to write the code, but also useful for those who are expert because after all it takes time to think, write, test the code. And how does it matter whether this libray is created by you, your project team member or google? As long as you understand what you want and what snippet code can achieve that use that without having the guilt feeling that I am writing the code. After all business is not about writing code but to solve social and business problems. If there is a way in the form of libraries or snippnet or template to solve those problem using them is wise. But keep in mind you it is alway great you know what each line of the code is doing.
