## Introduction
In computer programming, a **console** is an interface that allows interaction between the user and the computer system. It is typically used for text-based input/output operations, where commands or instructions can be entered, and responses or feedback are displayed. The console is widely used for debugging, monitoring system operations, or running command-line programs.

     - **Command Prompt** (Windows)
     - **PowerShell** (Windows)
     - **Bash** (Linux/macOS)

2. **Developer Console**:
   - A debugging interface provided within development environments or browsers for developers to interact with code, check errors, and run scripts.
   - Examples: 
     - **Browser Developer Tools Console** (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
     - **Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Console** (Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA)

3. **Game Console**:
   - A console in video games that allows users to input commands or debug during gameplay.
   - Examples: 
     - **Unity Developer Console** (for debugging games developed in Unity)
     - **Source Engine Console** (used in Valve's Source Engine games)

4. **Server/Remote Console**:
   - A command-line interface for interacting with servers, either locally or remotely.
   - Examples:

   - A console used to interact with databases, allowing users to run queries and manage data.
   - Examples:
     - **MySQL Console**
     - **PostgreSQL psql Console**

6. **Embedded System Console**:
