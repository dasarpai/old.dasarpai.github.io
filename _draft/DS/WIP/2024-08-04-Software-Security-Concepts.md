# Software Security Concepts

## What are the major ideas which we need to understand while creating security architecture of any app?
The security architecture of an application encompasses various concepts and strategies designed to protect the application's data, resources, and services from threats. Here are the main ideas and concepts typically involved:

### 1. **[Authentication](#authentication)**
- **Definition**: Verifying the identity of users or systems interacting with the application.
- **Methods**: Passwords, biometrics, multi-factor authentication (MFA), single sign-on (SSO).

### 2. **[Authorization](#authorization)**
- **Definition**: Determining what authenticated users or systems are allowed to do.
- **Methods**: Role-based access control (RBAC), attribute-based access control (ABAC), access control lists (ACLs).

### 3. **Encryption**
- **Definition**: Protecting data by converting it into a secure format that is unreadable without a decryption key.
- **Types**: Symmetric encryption (same key for encryption and decryption), asymmetric encryption (public and private keys), data-at-rest encryption, data-in-transit encryption.

### 4. **Integrity**
- **Definition**: Ensuring data remains accurate and unaltered during storage and transmission.
- **Methods**: Hashing, digital signatures, checksums.

### 5. **Non-repudiation**
- **Definition**: Ensuring that a party in a communication cannot deny the authenticity of their signature on a document or a message that they sent.
- **Methods**: Digital signatures, audit trails.

### 6. **Auditing and Logging**
- **Definition**: Recording and monitoring activities to detect and respond to security incidents.
- **Methods**: Event logs, transaction logs, audit trails.

### 7. **Network Security**
- **Definition**: Protecting data during transmission over networks.
- **Methods**: Firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), virtual private networks (VPNs), secure socket layer (SSL)/transport layer security (TLS).

### 8. **Application Security**
- **Definition**: Implementing measures within the application to protect against threats.
- **Methods**: Secure coding practices, input validation, error handling, patch management.

### 9. **Data Protection**
- **Definition**: Ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.
- **Methods**: Data masking, encryption, backup and recovery strategies.

### 10. **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**
- **Definition**: Managing digital identities and controlling access to resources.
- **Components**: User provisioning, authentication, authorization, user directories, identity governance.

### 11. **Security Policies and Governance**
- **Definition**: Defining and enforcing security rules and procedures.
- **Components**: Security policies, standards, guidelines, compliance requirements.

### 12. **Risk Management**
- **Definition**: Identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks to the application's security.
- **Methods**: Threat modeling, risk assessments, vulnerability assessments, penetration testing.

### 13. **Incident Response**
- **Definition**: Preparing for, detecting, and responding to security breaches or incidents.
- **Components**: Incident response plan, security operations center (SOC), forensic analysis.

### 14. **Physical Security**
- **Definition**: Protecting physical hardware and infrastructure that supports the application.
- **Methods**: Access controls, surveillance, environmental controls (e.g., fire suppression).

### 15. **Security Awareness and Training**
- **Definition**: Educating users and administrators about security best practices and policies.
- **Methods**: Training programs, phishing simulations, security awareness campaigns.

### 16. **[Compliance and Regulatory Requirements](#can-you-share-popular-compliance-and-regulatory-requirements-around-various-industries)**
- **Definition**: Adhering to legal and regulatory standards relevant to the application and its data.
- **Examples**: GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS.

By integrating these concepts into the security architecture, an application can better defend against threats, ensure data protection, and maintain the trust of its users and stakeholders.

## What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
**Authentication** and **authorization** are two fundamental concepts in security, often used together but distinct in their roles and functions:

### Authentication

**Authentication** is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity. It answers the question: "Who are you?"

- **Purpose**: To confirm the identity of the user.
- **Process**: Users typically provide credentials such as a username and password, biometrics, or other authentication factors (e.g., two-factor authentication).
- **Outcome**: Successful authentication results in the system recognizing the user as a legitimate entity, granting access to the user's account or session.

### Authorization

**Authorization** is the process of determining what an authenticated user is allowed to do. It answers the question: "What are you allowed to do?"

- **Purpose**: To grant or deny permissions to resources or actions based on the user's identity and role.
- **Process**: Once authenticated, the system checks the user's permissions or roles to decide what resources they can access and what actions they can perform.
- **Outcome**: Successful authorization allows the user to access specific resources or perform certain actions. Failed authorization results in access being denied.

### Key Differences

1. **Focus**:
   - Authentication focuses on verifying the identity of the user.
   - Authorization focuses on granting or denying permissions to authenticated users.

2. **Order**:
   - Authentication occurs first. A system needs to know who the user is before it can decide what they are allowed to do.
   - Authorization occurs after authentication. Once the user's identity is verified, the system checks their permissions.

3. **Mechanism**:
   - Authentication uses methods like passwords, biometrics, security tokens, etc.
   - Authorization uses policies, roles, access control lists (ACLs), etc.

### Example Scenario

Imagine a user logging into an online banking system:

1. **Authentication**: The user enters their username and password. The system verifies these credentials and confirms the user’s identity.
2. **Authorization**: Once authenticated, the system checks the user's permissions. For example, the user may have permission to view their account balance, transfer money, and pay bills, but not to access the bank's administrative functions.

In summary, authentication is about verifying who you are, while authorization is about verifying what you have access to. Both are critical components of security in any system.

## What is OAuth?

OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard for access delegation commonly used as a way to grant websites or applications limited access to user information without exposing passwords. It is widely used for logging into third-party services using an account from a major provider like Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.

OAuth is often misunderstood as an authentication protocol, but it is primarily an authorization framework. OAuth (Open Authorization) is a protocol that allows third-party applications to obtain limited access to a user's resources without exposing their credentials. It focuses on granting access (authorization) rather than verifying identity (authentication).

Here’s how OAuth works in a nutshell:

1. **Resource Owner**: The user who owns the data or resource.
2. **Client**: The application or website that wants to access the user’s data.
3. **Authorization Server**: The server that authenticates the user and grants access tokens.
4. **Resource Server**: The server hosting the protected resources (data).

### OAuth Process

1. **User Initiates Request**: The user starts by requesting access to the client (app).
2. **Authorization Request**: The client redirects the user to the authorization server with a request for access.
3. **User Authentication and Authorization**: The user authenticates (logs in) with the authorization server and approves the client’s access request.
4. **Authorization Code**: If the user approves, the authorization server redirects the user back to the client with an authorization code.
5. **Access Token Request**: The client exchanges the authorization code for an access token from the authorization server.
6. **Access Token Granted**: The authorization server issues an access token to the client.
7. **Accessing Resources**: The client uses the access token to access the resource server on behalf of the user.

### Benefits of OAuth

- **Security**: Reduces the need for users to share passwords with third-party applications.
- **User Control**: Users can grant and revoke access permissions.
- **Scalability**: Works with various devices and platforms.
- **Interoperability**: Standardized, widely adopted protocol.

### Common Use Cases

- Single Sign-On (SSO): Logging into multiple services with one set of credentials.
- API Authorization: Allowing applications to interact with other services on behalf of a user.
- Mobile and Desktop Applications: Securing access to resources across different platforms.

OAuth is available in two major versions, OAuth 1.0a and OAuth 2.0, with OAuth 2.0 being the more widely adopted and modern version.
