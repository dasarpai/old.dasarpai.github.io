Here are some important benchmarks commonly used in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs):

1. **Graduate-level reasoning (GPQA)**: Evaluates advanced reasoning capabilities akin to graduate-level examinations.

2. **Undergraduate-level knowledge (MMLU)**: The Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark assesses a model's knowledge across 57 subjects, including humanities, social sciences, and STEM, testing from elementary to advanced professional levels【54†source】【58†source】.

3. **Coding proficiency (HumanEval)**: Evaluates a model's ability to generate and understand code through a set of programming problems that test language comprehension, algorithms, and simple mathematics【58†source】.

4. **General Language Understanding (GLUE and SuperGLUE)**: GLUE includes various NLP tasks like sentiment analysis and paraphrase detection, while SuperGLUE adds more complex tasks such as reading comprehension and commonsense reasoning【56†source】【58†source】.

5. **Commonsense reasoning (HellaSwag)**: Focuses on evaluating a model's ability to handle real-world reasoning tasks by presenting scenarios with plausible and deceptive endings【55†source】【57†source】.

6. **Question Answering (SQuAD and AI2 Reasoning Challenge)**: SQuAD evaluates reading comprehension by requiring models to find answers within a given text, while the AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC) tests complex, multi-part science questions【56†source】【57†source】.

7. **Truthfulness (TruthfulQA)**: Measures the accuracy and reliability of a model in generating truthful responses, addressing the challenge of imitative falsehoods【58†source】.

8. **Mathematical Reasoning (MATH and GSM8K)**: MATH includes competition-level mathematics problems with detailed solutions, while GSM8K focuses on grade school math problems requiring sequential calculations【58†source】.

9. **Chatbot performance (Chatbot Arena and MT Bench)**: These benchmarks assess conversational fluency and goal-oriented success, often using human evaluations to determine the best-performing models【55†source】【58†source】.

These benchmarks provide a comprehensive overview of various capabilities and aspects of LLMs, from knowledge and reasoning to coding and conversational skills. For further details, you can explore the sources and learn more about how these benchmarks are applied and the specific datasets they use.

4. **HumanEval**: Tests coding proficiency by evaluating models on programming tasks and their ability to generate functional code solutions.

5. **MBPP (Mostly Basic Python Programming)**: Evaluates LLMs on Python programming tasks, covering fundamental coding skills.

6. **GSM8K**: Consists of grade school math word problems, testing arithmetic reasoning capabilities.

7. **HellaSwag**: Focuses on commonsense reasoning by presenting models with scenarios requiring logical and plausible continuations.

8. **ARC (AI2 Reasoning Challenge)**: Measures general fluid intelligence using multiple-choice science questions.

9. **DROP (Discrete Reasoning Over Paragraphs)**: Evaluates reading comprehension and reasoning abilities by asking models to extract and manipulate information from text.

10. **SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset)**: Assesses models on their ability to understand and answer questions based on a given text.

11. **TruthfulQA**: Tests whether models generate truthful answers across various domains, such as health, law, and finance.

12. **BBHard (BigBench)**: A comprehensive benchmark to probe models for future capabilities, covering diverse topics beyond current model capabilities.

These benchmarks help in assessing different aspects of LLM performance, such as language understanding, reasoning, coding, and truthfulness, providing a standardized way to compare models and identify areas for improvement【54†source】【55†source】【56†source】.
