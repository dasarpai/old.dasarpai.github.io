# What is Prompting?


## Trading
### Generate Code for Indicator
Generate a pine script code to create a simple moving average of the closing price with a period of 14 days which is compatable with v5 of pine script and uses 'color' dot before any color argument and 'ta' before any sma argument


Generate a pine script code when volume is 50% or greater above the moving average with a period of 15 days.

### Generate Code for Strategy - Automated Trade Strategies  
Generate a pine script code on macd crossover 

rewrite that to use strategy.enter and strategy.exit functions instead of using position variable

Generate a pin script code to determine position size based on a risk tolerance of 2% per trade and account size of $1000 and risk to reward ration 2 to 1.

### Generate Code for Trading Risk Management - Navigate the risk of the Market.
Generate pine script code to implement stop loss order at a value of 5% and trailing stop at a value of 2.5% for risk management.

Generate a pine script strategy 
that enter into trade on MACD crosses determine position size based on a risk toelratce of 2% per trade, account size of $1000

## Explain the code
If you copy and paste your pine script code (strategy) ChatGPT will summarise that whole strategy in couple of paragraphs.

Three guidelines for creating Prompt.
**Show and tell**. Make it clear what you want either through **instructions**, **examples**, or a **combination** of the two. If you want the model to **rank a list of items** in alphabetical order or to **classify a paragraph by sentiment**, show it that's what you want.

**Provide quality data**. If you're trying to build a classifier or get the model to follow a pattern, make sure that there are enough examples. Be sure to proofread your examples — the model is usually smart enough to see through basic spelling mistakes and give you a response, but it also might assume this is intentional and it can affect the response.

**Check your settings**. The temperature and top_p settings control how deterministic the model is in generating a response. If you're asking it for a response where there's only one right answer, then you'd want to set these lower. If you're looking for more diverse responses, then you might want to set them higher. The number one mistake people use with these settings is assuming that they're "cleverness" or "creativity" controls.
