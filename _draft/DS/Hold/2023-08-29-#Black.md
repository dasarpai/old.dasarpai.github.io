## What is Black?

- Black is the uncompromising Python code formatter. 
- Black gives you speed, determinism, and freedom from pycodestyle nagging about formatting. 
- You will save time and mental energy from code formatting.
- Blackened code looks the same regardless of the project you're reading. 
- Formatting becomes transparent after a while and you can focus on the content instead.
- Black makes code review faster by producing the smallest diffs possible.
- [PyCon2019 Talk - Life Is Better Painted Black, or: How to Stop Worrying and Embrace Auto-Formatting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esZLCuWs_2Y)
- PEP8 - Python Style Guide. Suggest mutliple ways to write code. Created in 2001
- Code style is subsect of Style Guide.
- Linters is code formater. But it is slow.
- If you don't like code getting formatted automatically then you may not like Black.
- Formatter 
	- gofmt for go 
	- Prettier for Javascript
	- Black for Python
- verticle space is space between code lines. - Horizontal space is space between words in a code line 
- To format python code: pip install black
- To format jupyter notebook : pip install "black[jupyter]"


Project Black is Used in 
- pytest, tox, Pyramid, Django, Django Channels, Hypothesis, attrs, SQLAlchemy, Poetry, PyPA applications (Warehouse, Bandersnatch, Pipenv, virtualenv), pandas, Pillow, Twisted, LocalStack, every Datadog Agent Integration, Home Assistant, Zulip, Kedro, OpenOA, FLORIS, ORBIT, WOMBAT

Organizations Using Black

# The Black Magic of Python Wheels - PyCon 2019
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02aAZ8u3wEQ
- Python Packaging and Distribution
- ELF (Executable Link formatting) files 
- Dynamic Linking 
- ABI (Application Binary Interface) symbol versioning 
 
# Eggs vs Wheel 
- Eggs
	- No PEP 
	- No Standard
	- it has pyc files so python version compatilbity issue. 
- Wheel 
	= Designed for distribution 
	- cannot include .pyc file but other compiled files are ok. 
- Adopted by PEP 427 
- Follows PEP standards for Distibution and Package metadata 
-
# 3 Types Wheel 
- Pure wheel : just python code, specific for a python version.
- Uniserval Wheel : python 2, 3 compatible. 
	pip install wheel 
	python setup.py bdist_wheel 
- Extension wheel 

Extension without Binary distribution 
pip install cryptography 
sudo apt install python-dev # python.h 
sudo apt install libffi-dev 
sudo apt install opensslv-dev 

time pip install cryptography #prebuilt binary . Saves time 

Extension wheel are safe to pip install 
Like eggs, conda was not adpoted by PEP 
Conda package are not python-specific. They are not supported by PyPi
Conda packagea are not compatable with non-conda env. 
Wheel are compatable with entire python ecosystem 
python extension = python native extension 
Native means code was compiled for  my OS and my python versin.
Extension : this library extends pythons functionality with non-python code 
Above cryptography is written in c.
CFFI: C foreign function interface for python 

For python to harness its full potential it must be able to depend on c libs.
Python native extion does above work.
