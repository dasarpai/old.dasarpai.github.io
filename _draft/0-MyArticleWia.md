Dear Friends    
    
Dharma is not about justice nor it is about religion.     
It is about empathy, compassion, co-existence.     
When you fight for Dharma you do not win or lose but everyone wins.     
Love and a higher understanding come.    
    
In a Dharmic society, people are sensitive to each other.     
Their focus is not to win others but to conquer themselves and evolve.     
In a Dharmic society, man evolves and he has high chances     
to become Mahatma, sage, Devta, or God.    
    
I personally feel that in the last couple of years and in the year 2013     
we in India forced ourselves to think that how sensitive we are to each other.     
Whatever is the pole politicians vs common man,     
female security vs man’s arrogance,     
powerful nations vs poor countries,     
religion vs religion etc we started thinking more about another pole.     
We may not see any visible actions     
but we started realizing that we must learn to live in co-existence.    
    
I pray that our societies, political leaders,     
friends and foes become more Dharmic and     
sensitive for all living beings in this year and in coming years.    
    
May we do not focus on materialistic growth quarter by quarter     
but internal peace and happiness second by second.     
May production and consumption     
of the materialistic product, services, and result     
become less important for us than the production     
of more peace and happiness in ourselves and around ourselves.    
    
May we understand that all beings, animals, plants,     
humans of different religions, and countries     
all have equal rights on the resources of this mother earth.    
    
May those rights not set by currency exchange rates,     
weapons they possess, gold they possess     
but by the love which they can share with all.    
    
Love & Regards

# Article5002 : Thirukkural In Hindi    
tags: [Indian Culture, Philosophy, Thirukkural]    
    
Namaste,    
    
Recently I came across this ancient Tamil literature and I could not stop myself from getting the meaning. Once I understood the meaning and philosophy I wanted to enjoy the singing and meaning both.    
    
I can read Tamil letters but I do not know the meaning so my purpose was not fulfilled. Then I started looking for this treasure in Devanagari Script with Hindi Meaning. I searched but I could not find anyone PDF which I can print and use during my prayer. Keeping this goal in mind I extracted Devnagri text from [this site](https://www.geocities.ws/nvkashraf), correct the text in many places, and created this pdf file for Bhajan’s purpose.    
    
If you wish, you can keep it in your collection of books for easy access. This is wonderful work and I recommend that one must read it and feel the meaning of this in day to day life.    
    
Hindu’s dharma literature says there are four “Purushartha” of human life (purpose of life). Bhagwan Thiruvalluvar does not expect any human being to achieve Moksha in life but expects that a person lives divine life on the earth itself.    
    
This book discusses Dharma, Artha, and Karma of life. To have better administration, better relations between humans of all faiths, respect and harmony with nature, a life full of happiness, etc this book is highly useful. My South Indian friend knows the beauty and glory of this book but Hindi speaking friends do not know much about this work.

# Article5003 : Who Is The Real Enemy Of A Hindu    
tags: [My Views, Real Enemy, Hindu Society]    
    
Namaste,    
    
All the old religions and civilizations of the world like Unan, Rome, Egypt are crashed only Hindu, the oldest civilization, could dare to see the sun of 21 century. It is not because the Hindus have been a great fighter or defender but because of great knowledge and values in our Vedas and Upnishads and great saints who translated the same for us from time to time. Saints did this selflessly and people believed them blindly because of this selfless nature and the value which people saw in their teachings.    
    
In the 21st century, Hindus and their religion will die if we do not return to Vedas or Upnishads. I do not spend time reading and understanding those. Scripture will not die, other religions will be created from those and existing will modify their interpretation in tune with Vedas and Upnishads without attributing the learning to the source. Hindus are not in danger because of any other religion. In fact, the time of barbaric behavior and imposing religion on others have gone. People are losing faith in this religion because of their sallow understanding, remaining busy in their bread earning job, doing useless rituals, visiting masked babas, visiting temples and making them a dirty place, giving money to temple and thinking that my job is over. How many of us, especially those who bother about the existence of the Hindu religion and the great teaching, really give time to read the Vedas, Upnishads, and realizing the truth through meditation.    
    
In fact, today’s Hindus sing devotional songs on high speed, high volume senseless filmy songs, sings all the Aartis of all gods because of fear or many hopes from many gods, go to a temple to eat Prasad, go on pilgrimage to have great fun and enjoy a picnic. How can we save the Hindu civilization by these practices? In fact, we have become headless people with respect to Hindu practices. Besides all this we sometimes abuse our religion, sometimes appreciate others too much without seeing our values, sometimes blame other religions for our fall. We never have fallen so much in those 2000 years of attack, crusades, and missionaries as much we have fallen in the last 50 years.    
    
Time to introspection for all the Hindus who want this great civilization should continue eternally as it is called Sanatana Dharma! We should behave like intellectuals and for that purpose return to Upnishads and Vedas. Start reading the translation of those done by our great sages or learn Sanskrit and meditation to do the same for yourself.

Dear Friend,    
    
I would like to wish you a healthy, rewarding and productive new year 2015 & Mary Christmas.    
    
If you are living in India or doing business in India then I hope you agree with me that this year we have restored systems which is much stable, faithful and interested in the growth of all. And coming year is about actions within the system to strengthen the nation and profession.    
    
A peaceful, powerful India is necessary for the world peace. Therefore lets pray and work for peaceful India, Indian neighbor and worldwide.    
    
Let us build our nation, communities and nations around us using project management best practices and high ethical standards.    
    
May the supreme cosmic forces which different religion call by different name(s) give the Dharmic mind to all specially to those who are either consistently disturbing harmony or thinking Adharmic.    
    
May there be peace at physical level, mental level and soul level all around.    
    
May your grow and live in peace and harmony all around you and within you.

Dear Friends,    
    
This year whatever you want to get more start sharing that in your best capacity.    
    
– Want money? Share yours with underprivileged.    
    
– Want knowledge? Share yours with those who need it most.    
    
– Want love? Open your heart and empathise with those who are in need of care, orphans, lonely etc.    
    
It looks year is new but it is just another moment of our life no different from previous if we are not having resolutions to evolve in our life.    
    
New year is a mental phenomenon which happens once a year because mentally we have dividend eternity in packets of time called second minutes hours days week years etc. If we are evolving towards divinity then every minute is era else every year passes like just another minute of our life has gone and thus whole life goes with lots of material acquisition and zero mental or spiritual evolution.

# Article5006 : Understanding The Reality Of The World    
tags: [Bhagwat Gita, Philosophy, Maya]    
    
## The reality in the Reflection    
    
Namaste,     
    
I am not sure how many of you will be able to recollect this sloka from Bhagwat Geeta Chapter 15.    
    
ऊर्ध्वमूलमधःशाखमश्वत्थं प्राहुरव्ययम्‌ | छन्दांसि यस्य पर्णानि यस्तं वेद स वेदवित्‌ ॥ BG:15-1    
    
This is the first sloka of this chapter and this chapter is called Purushotam Yoga. In our scripture, everything is told in the form of poetry, and therefore many times we get dragged into the rhythm, beauty of words, commandments, prayers, etc. But seldom we dwell in these words which can shake us vigorously. The simple word to word meaning of this sloka is as below.    
    
There is a tree called Ashwath. Branches of this tree are downside and roots are upside. Vedas are its leaves of this tree, that who knows this tree is the knower of Vedas.    
    
ऊर्ध्व= Upside, मूलम्‌=Root, अधः=Downside, शाखम्‌=Branch, अश्वत्थं=Ashwath Tree, प्राहुः=Told, अव्ययम्‌=Eternal |     
छन्दांसि=Vedas, यस्य=Of this, पर्णानि=Leaves, यः=That, तम्‌=Whom, वेद=Known, स=He, वेदवित्‌=Knower     
Although every chapter, every sloka, and every word of the Bhagwat Geeta is extremely important but in the Hindu tradition, many of the traditional people emphasize the importance of learning this whole chapter which contains 20 slokas. Most of the traditional people recite those 20 slokas of this chapter before taking food, so sometimes it looks that this chapter reminds us about food. Anyway, this was the lighter side of this sloka. Analysis of the sloka is below.    
    
First, this sloka is talking about a tree. The tree, which is not seen in the world by the physical eyes.     
Second, this sloka is talking about the importance of “knowing” this tree. It says that a person is the knower of Vedas.    
    
A tree has leaves, fruits, branches, seeds. So this sloka also encourages us to think about all these aspects of this tree. Sloka says leaves are Vedas. But what about fruits? They are Karmafale. What about branches? They are Karma. What about the seed? That is desire. Of whose desire? The desire of Brahman (the supreme reality).     
So by doing Vedic duties &amp; worldly karma you nurture this tree. So you get the karma fala in life which you enjoy. Sometimes the fruits are sweet and other times it has a different taste. Sometimes you like the taste and other times you do not. You do not have a choice of eating different fruit than the fruit for which you have done karma. If you do not like fruit then do not blame fruit but introspect your own karma.    
    
Sloka says this tree is eternal. The entire world rests on this tree and enjoys the bad or good fala of karma. This tree is an inverted tree. Have you ever seen an inverted tree anywhere? Go on the river bank, and see the shadow of the tree in the river, it is an inverted tree. So which tree is real the tree in the water of a river or on the bank of the river. So this sloka is trying to tell us that the world where we enjoy karma fala is not the real world. It is a shadow world. The real world is something different. Where is the real world and how far it is away from the unreal world? The real-world and unreal worlds are at the same distance as the shadow of a tree and the real tree on the river bank. They both exist simultaneously. One which is perceived by the physical eyes is not real, one which is known by inner sense is the real. The shadow of the tree does not have its own existence, it depends upon the real tree. This is called Maya. Maya means it exists but its reality depends upon something else. The shape of the shadow of a tree is the same as the real tree. In absence of light, you cannot see the shadow tree but it does not mean that the real tree also has washed away in the river water. But do we have this much time to bother about the reality? We get dragged into the world knowing that everything here is an absolute reality.    
    
Further sloka says that those who know about this tree are the real knower of the Vedas. It means the purpose of the Vedas is to reveal this tree to us. Those who know the invertedness of this tree is not a reality, but there is a real tree that cannot be seen by the physical eyes, he knows the Vedas. We need to understand the sharpest knowledge senses (eye, skin, ear, nose, tongue) of a human can deceive him/her, but the sharpest intellect with a balanced emotional mind that has a strong desire to understand reality cannot be deceived. So the reality of the Vedas cannot be known and enjoyed by physical senses but by pure intellect and pure mind.    
    
In the following sloka, Bhagwat Geeta says that only those who know this tree can cut it. And cutting is the only solution if you want to come out endless life-death cycle and enjoying the good and bad fruits of this tree. But because this is not about the physical reality of the physical sense therefore cutting is also not physical. Here cutting means dropping the sense of reality about unreal. It is only possible by Vairagya (renunciation).

Namaste,     
    
In our life, a new day comes every day     
but only once in 365 days a new day also comes with the new year.     
Like the circle of 360 degrees, 365 days of a year also represents a circle of time.     
Only a few who learn from the previous circle and     
plan for a new circle move vertically in the circle     
and create a spring of evolution in life.     
For others, it is like moving around the same circle throughout life,     
like in the picture above.    
    
What you learn and in what sense you evolve     
from one year to another depends upon you.     
Some collect bitter memories and experiences and     
others in all circumstances collect good memories and experiences.    
    
If you are an atheist then I assure you that next year     
I will be with you to create positive experiences in your life     
whenever you want just remember me and I will do my bit for you.    
    
If you are an Astika and believe in many Gods     
then I pray to all your gods that help my friend     
in achieving all whatever Sattva s/he wants to get in his/her life.    
    
If you are an Astika and believe in only one god     
then I pray to that one God that please help my friend     
in living with you in all the walk of his/her life     
and may your love shower upon her/him for the whole year.    
    
If you are Astika and believe in Ishwara of Advaita Vedanta then     
I meditate with you to be one with unmanifested God     
and manifest all the virtues in nature and lives around in the next year.    
    
Wish you a very happy, healthy, joyful new year ahead.

# Article5008 : Greetings For New Year 2019    
tags: [ 'Annual Wishes']    
    
Dear Friends    
    
We suffer ONLY in present. But this suffering happens either because of repentance of the past or fear of the future. The past has gone and the future will come. But there are people who start praying in present to secure the future. The future is full of possibilities & we pray in the present so that when the future becomes present then the possibilities which become the reality should bring happiness for us and the people around us.    
    
So today, at the launching pad of the new year, I pray in this present and request you to join in your present (when you read this msg), if you agree with me that.    
    
Let all walls of religions, languages, colors, genders, nationalities, races, regions, political parties, and ideologies fall in the future.    
    
May I live with an open mind that I am a human being and the most intelligent species on this planet so I must be the guardian of all other living or non-living around me.    
    
May I get timely intellect and intelligence to understand that when a time has come to forget bad of my own or of people around me.    
    
May I get timely intellect and intelligence to understand that when it is important to forgive ourselves and the people around me.    
    
May I understand that in this constantly changing world I, the observer of the change, am the only constant & permanent because all changing phenomenon is physical and I, observer, is a non-physical?    
    
May I understand that pain is inflicted on my body because of physical injuries and it takes its own time to heal but suffering is a thought living in my mind and it can live an exceptionally long life, even carry to our next life. Therefore may I get the wisdom and I learn, how NOT to suffer.    
    
May I learn it experimentally that I am not the first nor last human race on this planet so I should produce, consume, accumulate, throw objects carefully.    
    
May I understand it intellectually that this is not my first nor last birth. So, if I come back to this earth again after a few years I should not feel that what dirty things I have done in my previous life due to which I am facing these many problems now. The problem may be related to eating, drinking, living together in a peaceful way, etc. The truth is whatever good or bad we are seeing around us is created by us either in this life or previous life.    
    
May I always get the company of wise people around me.    
    
May I also become wise enough to understand that who is wise or who not around me.    
    
May unwise people go away from my physical and mental existence so that I do not suffer because of their influence upon me.    
    
Love & Regards

# Article5009 : Who Is The Doer?    
tags: [ Concepts, Philosophy]    
    
Namaste,    
    
Who is the cause of doing?     
Who gets the fruit of action?     
There are the following confusions/believes in the mind of people in our society.    
    
1. Some say I do and I bear the fruit. No role of god.    
2. Some say God does everything, without His desires even a leaf doesn’t fall from a tree.    
3. I do but God is instrumental in getting this done through me. We, Jeeva, are just being played we get the fruit in the form of Sukha and Dukha.    
4. No one is a doer, no one causes, nothing happening here all is our mental creation.    
5. No one is a doer, no one is a cause, nothing is happening, we do not exist. This all is happening in the Dream of God. In fact, our waking state is also a dream of God. When God awake life is over.    
6. This all is Leela of God. He is alone and he is playing. We think we are doing and getting the fruits of karma. But that is just thinking not the truth.    
7. There is no God. Human desire and compulsiveness are the cause of action, a human does it and he reaps the fruit. Everybody gets Karmafala some get it more at a physical level some more at mental and others at an intellectual level.    
    
Do you think any other belief exists in your mind?     
What do you think is the truth of this existence?     
I have different thinking on this.     
Let me put the idea forward through a story.    
    
A man living alone in a forest.     
Away from the hustle-bustle of the city.     
He has his own small house in the forest.     
One day a flight lost the signal,     
the pilot got a mild brain stroke,     
and the plane moves in a different direction.     
The flight goes in the forest and exactly above this person’s house     
flight crash and everybody is dead,     
Except for this pilot and forest man both are hugely injured     
but no support and crying hugely in pain     
at a 500-meter distance from each other.    
    
Who is the doer this whole event?     
What is the cause of this event?     
Who is getting the fruits of this event?    
    
Events in life are not that simple which we think.     
It looks simple because we refuse to think     
either because we are tired or lazy or dull in mind.    
    
If the Cosmos is intelligent or God is a working force then     
What justifies the pain of one from the Karma of others?     
If we look at events or objects around     
as an individual doer then it looks almost impossible to know.     
Is it easy to navigate the Karma?     
Is it possible to know who is the real doer?

Namaste,    
    
The tick of the time never stops.     
For the body, it simply means from birthplace to crematorium.     
Every second, we go close to that place.     
No matter, in what direction we run and what we do on this planet.     
Whether we are aware or not.     
Sleeping or working. Laughing or crying.     
Making money or losing. Giving or taking.     
The currency of life is time.    
    
You give time and get life to do whatever you want.     
When time is over then you cannot buy more life,     
no matter how precious work you want to do.     
It is just precious for you and not for time.    
    
So from birth to death, a time span of all lives around us     
helps us growing continuously.     
Physically you will grow.     
At least the next day you become one day older.     
But is that the only growth?    
    
We are human. We have fuss for everything we do.     
We want to do it differently from other lives around us     
better than plants, insects, and animals.     
Not only that better than the next standing person to us.     
But how to do that?    
    
Well, with the least pain and least investment     
wants most learning or wealth creation.     
That is why a human is called an economic animal.    
    
Learn from other’s experiences, failure.     
How? observe them, read books.     
So we want to succeed with the least price.     
But older people tell us that there is no short cut in life.     
You need to burn your time of life     
and put your emotions on the task     
that is the way to experience life     
and that the best way to learn.    
    
There are people who say there is nothing in life to learn.     
Just experience, experience, and experience.     
No matter how much you learn and who teaches you     
if you have to get some more experience of the same thing     
then life will discover other ways     
and you end up in the same circumstances     
even after being conciseness and wanted to avoid.    
    
Who wants to die? who wants failure?     
Who wants to fall? Who wants sickness?     
To handle all these we run schools,     
parents teach their children     
and even after this whole enterprise going around us.     
We see failures, falls, loss, miseries, etc.    
    
For what? Are these things teaching you something?     
It looks just for the sake of creating an experience     
life is playing in and around us.    
    
No accumulation helps.     
Only heart and mind full of compassion     
and body fit to walk on this planet     
helps you living and experiencing.

4\. Wanted to Renew License but for payment this time I wanted GST Bill with my GST details-&gt;     
5\. No option of entering my GST number on Microsoft website-&gt;     
6\. Did research, no outcome -&gt;     
7\. Call Microsoft, Pathetic Help -&gt;     
8\. Finally Come to Know for Home Edition GST Bill not available -&gt;     
9\. In the meantime found since last 3 years MS every year increasing cost of this software around 1000/year (INR 4200 to 5200 to 6300 this year) so to reduce the cost by adjusting GST I Wanted to Purchase Software through Business Account-&gt;     
10\. Went on Microsoft site to create office license under my company name (I have a google private domain name for that)-&gt;     
11\. It asked me to enter TXT or MX record in the domain to prove that I am the owner of the site-&gt;     
12\. Existing domain is a private domain so TXT or MX records cannot be updated -&gt;     
13\. Existing pmohead@drrxxx.in is customer’s account so no use for me as of today -&gt;     
14\. Tried my another domain, but encountered a problem that emails are bouncing from there-&gt;     
15\. Researched and come to know that it is because of Cloudflare -&gt;     
16\. Figured out how Cloudflare works and why I installed this-&gt;     
17\. Now, to make email working I called the hosting company of this domain-&gt;     
18\. They told me to make MX or TXT record entry in Cloudflare DNS and use that Cloudflare provided DNS-&gt;     
19\. Figured out where DNS entry should be made (it should be done at domain provider’s site), in my case my domain is taken from godaddy so on godaddy site -&gt;     
20\. By default GoDaddy has its own DNS entry corresponding to my domain -&gt;     
21\. My content is hosted on Hostgator therefore I should enter HostGator DNS on GoDaddy site (it was learning for me) -&gt;     
22\. If I want Cloudflare should work then DNS records provided by Cloudflare should be entered -&gt;     
23\. I tried, now emails are not bouncing but not getting delivered as well -&gt;     
24\. I research this issue further and come to know that this is a common problem that Cloudflare and email compatibility issue exist and lot of struggle to make it work -&gt;     
25\. Disabled my Cloudflare services for my domain on Cloudflare site -&gt;     
26\. Made GoDaddy DNS entry as default -&gt;     
27\. Now my website site stopped working-&gt;     
28\. Come to know that changes will be effective in 24-48 hours, so wait-&gt;     
29\. But then realized that DNS entry should be of Hostgator because that is the place where content is hosted -&gt;     
30\. So changed the DNS on hostgator, now domain is working -&gt;     
31\. Still I don’t have any new domain which I can use to purchase Microsoft 365 office business license-&gt;     
32\. Used my third domain RXXX-&gt;     
33\. Earlier I was not using this because I didn’t want to confuse my licensing with too many unrelated domains but now I have no solution -&gt;     
34\. Created new Microsoft office 365 account with RXXX domain-&gt;     
35\. Now wanted to purchase the license but now it says the cost of the business license itself equal to the cost which I was paying for Office 365 Home Edition + GST. And GST is extra. so the whole exercise is futile-&gt;     
36\. Started looking for an alternative of office 365 -&gt; Found libre 6.2.4 &amp; Polaris Office 2017 -&gt;     
37\. Download and tried but only Polaris is a little bit near to Office 365 -&gt;     
38\. Finally took the decision this year I will not use Office 365 and manage with Polaris, free license, or if required professional license. If this does not serve my purpose and a need arises during my data science work then only I will purchase-&gt;     
39\. Finally open GST billing data in Polaris software    
    
The whole 12 hours went to into drain and at 10 pm, I am proceeding for GST Annual Finally    
    
I am sure many of you have burned someday of your life like this. Don’t worry you are not alone.

# Article5012 : About Shoonya Zero    
tags: [ Concepts, Philosophy]    
    
Namaste,    
    
Do you have experience of Shoonya?     
Have you seen Shoonya?     
If you experienced it then what time and what place it existed?     
Is this a thing or that which is not a thing at all?    
    
Does it exist in time and space     
of our perceptions as non-matter?     
Is it just a mathematical concept to represent     
the absence of something which we are counting?    
    
Is it just a philosophical concept to contemplate     
beyond time &amp; space creation?     
How many Shoonyas are there?     
Isn’t it the same Shoonya which we refer to     
in all the place and in all the time when we say a certain thing is absent?    
    
Can you fill the Shoonya with something?     
Can you replace the Shoonya with something?    
    
When we say Shoonya apple on the table     
it means you are referring to Abhava/absence of Apple on the table.     
But apple still exists on a tree or in a market or in the other room.    
    
But can we Shoonya Jingorapp on the table?     
Don’t look for the dictionary of Jinorapp!     
As per my knowledge, it does not exist in any of the languages which I know.     
So Jingorapp is not on the table, nor in the market,     
nor on trees, nor anywhere on this planet,     
nor anywhere in this universe.    
    
Knowing this, can we say Shoonya Jingorapp on the table?     
How Shoonya Jingorapp different from Shoonya apple on the table?    
    
In these two sentences, we are talking about two different objects,     
one which exists and which does not exist.     
But, these two statements are we referring     
to the same Shoonya or different?    
    
Can you refer to darkness as Shoonya?     
Can you refer to light as Shoonya?     
Can you refer to empty space as Shoonya?     
Can you refer to space that is 100% filled,     
even an extra atom cannot be placed there, as Shoonya?     
Can you refer to the thoughtlessness state of your mind as Shoonya?     
Can you refer to a deep meditative state of your mind as Shoonya?     
Can you say my mind becomes Shoonya when I am in deep sleep?     
When no surrounding awareness exists     
can you say this is the Shoonya state of mind?    
    
Shoonya is about your awareness.     
Shoonya is about awareness of something which exists.     
Shoonya is about awareness of something which not exists.     
Shoonya exists only in one place. This place is called “in our awareness”.     
It is not a physical place but a place of mind where creation happens.     
Most of the creation of the mind takes physical form.     
But this creation of mind never ever takes shape in any space and time.     
That is why it exists but does not exists simultaneously.    
    
You can never miss your future.     
You always miss your past.     
And you miss your past always in the present.     
Shoonya is referring to Abhava or the missing something from some past.     
Shoonya is related to your past experience,     
which you miss to experience in the present.    
    
When you miss some person, event, place that time there is Shoonya.     
When you perform absolutely worse in the exam you get Shoonya.     
When you spend all money from the bank then ATM denies dispensing money.     
Because you have something there but that is a Shoonya.     
So on ATM dispenser, you get a Shoonya.     
When you fall in bungee jump you experience a Shoonya.     
When you are completely exhausted     
in your energy you experience a Shoonya.    
    
When you are so engrossed in something     
that you lost sense of time and space then you experienced Shoonya.     
In a remote vast land, sitting on the earth     
when you see the empty sky in the day, you see a Shoonya.     
In a remote vast land sitting on the earth     
when you see an empty sky in the night, you see a Shoonya.     
When you close your eye and miss     
your nearer or dearer one then you see a Shoonya.    
    
At any time of your awareness,     
you don’t see the light but the source of light and objects which are being lighted.     
Similarly, you don’t see the Shoonya     
but it gets manifested in the present in all the things     
which you experienced in the past but not available around.    
    
It looks like Shoonya is nowhere, but if you look inside your mind     
then you will find that it can find Shoonya in everything.    
    
So all of sudden which is nowhere     
becomes everywhere but no physical experience.    
    
In 3GL computer programming,     
we call this is not a normal variable but a pointer     
that is being referred from many places.    
    
But in the case of Shoonya, it referring to Null.     
In computer programming generally null means no address no value     
But in the world around us,     
it means pregnant with potentialities and possibilities.    
    
Now think, how Shoonya is different from Infinity.     
I think the Shoonya is one, the Infinity is one, and the One is one.     
There is no Second Shoonya, Second infinity, Second one.

# Article5013 : About Responsibility    
tags: [ Concepts, Philosophy]    
    
Namaste,    
    
Responsibility is a Noun. But it takes birth from a verb “ability”.     
The ability to respond is called responsibility    
    
Who is that living being who cannot respond?     
Only dead cannot respond!     
The question is about choice.     
To something, we want to respond to some others not.     
But that is called freedom.     
Who is that wise person who wants to renounce his freedom?    
    
I see a wonderful sunrise, I respond or not it is in my freedom of choice.     
I hear wonderful music, I respond or not it is in my freedom of choice.     
Somebody hurt me, I respond or not it is my freedom of choice.     
Somebody hit me, I respond or not it is my freedom of choice.     
Somebody hit my nation, my people, my relation, and things around me,     
I respond or not it is my freedom of choice.    
    
So, I retain the ability to respond to the situation around me.     
Whether to respond or not, how to respond,     
when to respond is my freedom of choice     
This is the way of the wise.    
    
But, when I say I am not responsible     
What does it mean?     
It is dead for me or     
I am dead for that or     
Don’t blame me for this.    
    
Mostly I want to say third     
But I forget to understand that     
“Ability” to respond is from the verb Ability.     
Blame is another verb.     
Why mix up these two verbs and I become stone?     
Like a stone, I have lost my ability to respond,     
so I am not responsible.    
    
I need to convince my heart that     
Being a human, no matter how powerful I am, I have limitations.     
Limitation because of body,     
A limitation which I self impose because of traditions.     
A limitation which law of the land and society imposes upon me     
A limitation because of the availability of resources.     
And these limitations restrict me to physically act on the events around me.    
    
But, responsibility is more to do with the mental act.     
Mentally I can act whatever way I want.     
A “freedom to think”, no one take away from me.     
Until somebody sits inside my mind and control my thoughts.     
It is me who needs to decide what to think and whatnot.     
But unfortunately, bodily impulsiveness and     
the world’s temptations control my mind.    
    
I run to this world like mad     
My thoughts are controlled by the surrounding     
Thus I surrender my freedom     
“A freedom” with which I think and say I am responsible.

# Article5014 : Prisoner Of The Mind    
tags: [ Mind, 'My Views', Philosophy, Poetry]    
    
Namaste,    
    
When I came to this planet,     
I had a body full of memories but a mind without many memories.     
And my mind was definitely without any biased memory.     
I was full of life and everything was full of life for me.     
Every happening was fresh, new, and full of excitement.     
I bothered not anything more than food.    
    
But then by eating I acquired more memories from the food I ate.     
After that, the world around me started teaching me.     
Every teaching became part of my mental memories     
Some I liked so they are sweet and I want to repeat them,     
Some I do not like so they are bitter and I avoid them.     
But liking and disliking of those memories belong to me.     
Memories themselves do not know     
whether they are sweet or bitter.    
    
Who am I, the heap of food,     
which has grown this big from a one feet child?     
Who am I, the heap of Ideas, prejudices, likes, dislikes     
that are stored in my memories,     
that I accumulated from this world?    
    
I accumulated both this body and this mind.     
I accumulated the wealth and relations around me.     
I am able to claim all my accumulations     
but not able to claim my “self” firmly.    
    
Not able to claim my “self” firmly that this is Me. Why?     
Why it is so that I am not able to claim my true identity?    
    
Because I am imprisoned by my mind.     
And those who are imprisoned do not have freedom.     
More I invested in developing this body and mind.     
More strong they became.     
And now stronger the wall of this prison.    
    
Now when I want to peep outside     
through a window, it is not possible.     
Because I have built this prison so solid     
that there is no hope of light coming inside.    
    
There is no window in this prison     
I cannot see the world outside of this prison,     
I cannot know the way the world exists there.    
    
I am salve of my memories.     
Because life is imprisoned in the memory     
I see everything through the memories.    
    
Is this world different than     
what do I imagine here in this prison?     
Definitely, it does not exist the way I see it.    
    
What I see is “My World”, a world of my memories     
What really exists is “The World”,     
a world that even isn’t aware of my existence.    
    
In fact, I am so small in this whole cosmos that     
“The World” even does not care and bother about me.     
So why should the world exist the way I think?    
    
Is there anyone who has seen this world the way it exists?     
Without being a prisoner of mind!     
How blessed are those who can this world the way it exists!    
    
You are the real knower     
if you can see this without attaching to memories.     
I salute your wisdom,     
which can separate the water from the milk.    
    
You live like a lotus,     
Who exists in the pond     
but without getting wet by the water     
and without getting tainted by the filth of the pond.    
    
You exist with your own fragrance.     
Because you are not a prisoner of mind.

# Article5015 : Mind And Pleasure    
tags: [ Mind, Mindfulness, Philosophy, 'Pleasure & Joy']    
    
Namaste,    
    
What is the mind? Don’t mistake it for the brain.     
The brain is physical and it is located inside the physical head.     
A perceiving mind is not a matter, but it matters a lot.     
This non-matter which matters is not located in one place.     
The whole body is the home of the mind.    
    
How the whole body has a mind?     
Let’s understand, what is the mind.     
This English term mind is very confusing.     
In Indian Yogic terms, there is nothing called a mind.     
In Yoga we have terms like Manas, Chitta, Buddhi, Ahamkar, Pragya.     
Manas is not Mind. Buddhi is not Intellect.     
Ahamkara is not Ego. There is no equivalent Chitta in English.     
Pragya has many meanings in English.    
    
Scope of the English word mind is following 11 activities     
defining, feeling, thinking, sensing, perceiving, intuiting,     
judging, associating, discriminating, assimilating, and creating.     
(feel free to add more if I missed adding that here)    
    
In Yoga Manas is a pool of thought and nothing else.     
Once thoughts disappear there is no Manas.    
    
Buddhi is a facility to analyze events, objects around us     
in the smallest possible units and     
seeing the sequence and parallelism etc.    
    
Ahamkara is self-identification with the help of things     
that are associated with you. Including body, mind, intellect,     
relations, car, bank balance, property, position, relations, etc.    
    
Chitta is a memory (Smriti) pool. There are two kinds of memories.     
One, which is part of your body cells     
which makes your body structure,     
color of your skin, the shape of your body parts, etc.     
The second kind of Chitta is, which is non-local, universal.     
You can connect to it and access the huge amount of information stored there.     
It is timeless, space-less but available to you     
only when you slip temporarily in that timelessness.    
    
Pragya is intelligence and wisdom to assimilate     
and understand the oneness of entire existence.    
    
Because of English education, most of us     
will not be able to understand these terms at the experiential level,     
so I will continue using the term mind.    
    
Today somebody in my circle asked me     
can we measure the mind?     
Based on my experience I can say the mind is not measured. It measures.     
It is like a scale. Scale measures but not measured, except for calibration purposes.     
In the case of mind, what is that which works as a calibrator of mind?     
Every scale has a unit of measurements     
and for the mind, the Unit is a pleasure.    
    
Pleasure for every mind is different.     
Therefore in a human to human relative sense,     
it looks there is no need for a calibrator.     
With the expansion of Pragya mind calibrates itself.     
Pleasure comes through mental or physical actions     
but it is perceived only by the mind.     
Pleasure is no different from pain.     
It is like a coin of exchange that has     
two parts called pleasure and pain.     
But, we still referring to that coin as pleasure.    
    
Pleasure and pain are closely related to     
your association with those objects     
on which the events are happening.    
    
Too much cold and heat on our skin give us too much pain.     
The same cold and heat on your friend’s skin give less pain to you.     
And the same cold and heat on some poor person’s skin,     
that is breaking the stone on the road, give you further less pain.     
The same cold and heat on someone who is far away from your land,     
language, religion makes you indifferent,     
unless you are a human rights professional     
and make your money by that sensationalization work.     
Too much temperature torture     
to a terrorist or criminal in jail gives you pleasure.    
    
This way you can expand this concept of pleasure and pain     
from heat and cold to your wealth, position, respect, status, title, etc.     
In a nutshell of whatever mind is aware     
and attached it feels pleasure and pain.    
    
Sometime back I mentioned [Prisoner of Mind,](https://wia.dasarpai.com/prisoner-of-the-mind/)     
In that sense, you feel pleasure and pain till     
the time you are a prisoner of the mind.    
    
Is it possible to break the prison of mind?     
Yes, it is possible. It is as easy as seeing your eyes     
without using any reflection like the mirror, water etc.     
Is it easy? Of course Yes and No, simultaneously.    
    
How to see your own mind without any help from outside?     
No help from friends, books, religion, etc.     
How to introspect your own mind?     
If you find something then share techniques with me.

# Article5016 : The Way Of Mother    
tags: [ 'My Story', Philosophy]    
    
Namaste,    
    
A twelve years old boy in a deep mountain     
quite engrossed in his play with crops, trees, mud, cattle, and fountain.     
He had a mother and other siblings     
His mother used to scold him and sometimes beat him for his mischief.     
Boy was very angry and questioned why my mother is unfair to me.     
One day he asked his mother. Are you my real mother?     
Why do you beat me and not my other siblings?    
    
Mother told him because you are the elder to them.     
You should take care of them and not beat them in my absence.     
The innocent boy was not able to understand the logic of her mother.     
He told me I beat them because they do mistakes.     
and elders always beat to young     
when they find mistake with young. Don’t you do that to me?     
Mother was puzzled.     
She told, then I beat you because you are not my real son.     
We have taken you from a temple,     
you were lying and crying and we brought you home.    
    
The boy went in silence and went away from home     
Walking on the thin muddy footpath of the mountain     
Rain of mountain made him wet.     
But he was madly walking without the awareness of rain.     
Thinking, who am I? who is my mother?     
why did she leave me in a temple? when will I meet my mother?    
    
This way the sun has set and it became very late in the evening.     
His mother was crying and searching for him madly.     
The boy came back home late in the evening,     
It was pitch dark and the mountain is full of wild animals,     
As soon as she saw the boy first she pulled him to her breast     
And then all of sudden she took Durga form,     
And put a tight slap with a broom she was holding     
in her hand on the legs of the boy.    
    
Boy was confused why this mother was mad for me     
and now why she is beating me every time?     
Probably he was trying to understand the way of mother     
This the way he was trying to understand the intricacy of a love of the mother    
    
One day his mother falls sick     
He took care of his mother and siblings to the best as a small boy can     
His mother was so sick that doctors told the family that she will not survive     
The boy was unable to understand the meaning of this.     
What will happen to my mother? Will she die?     
What happens at death? Do people come back after some time?    
    
The boy was so fresh life like Siddhartha, the Gautama.     
that he has not seen death ever before.     
Nor able to understand the meaning of the word “death”.     
The word death took birth in his consciousness.     
In his own mood, he started searching for god,     
death, return after death, and his own existence     
This is the way existence teaching him     
and making him ready for the inner dialogues with the mother.    
    
One day when he came back home from the mountain walk     
Someone told him that his mother is no more     
Earth slipped from his feet     
He thought he also has died     
Within a few minutes, he touched his own body     
and found himself perfectly fine     
He cried in silence and ran towards his mother     
But mother was not responding     
He wept but the first time she didn’t respond to his cry     
This is the way of mortal and not of a mother.    
    
Mother was cremated as per the village traditions     
The boy kept crying and asking when will you come back.     
Probably, some agreement happen between boy and mother     
and she told him that I will come back.    
    
The boy stopped crying.     
He had twenty-five paise coin in his small pocket     
He dug the earth and put that coin     
deep inside the womb of the earth     
And told to himself that when my mother will come     
I will tell her that I knew you will come back.    
    
But, when she will ask me     
how did you come to know that I will come back     
Then I will dig the earth and show her this twenty-five paise coin     
and say that the day you went I put this coin here     
Come and see this coin is here.    
    
This is the proof of my belief in you     
that you will come back and never leave me alone.     
This is the way boy was learning     
to communicate with immortal in the mortal world    
    
The boy started growing and every day waiting for his mother     
Many times she came into his dream, they talked in length     
But the moment he opens his eyes     
to run and dig the earth, the mother disappears.    
    
He was upset every time when he opens his eyes she disappears     
This way the boy remained in his own solitude for many years     
The boy became a grown-up man     
Now he understands the law of nature     
Now he knows those who depart this mortal world     
never ever come back to this earth in the same form     
This is the way the boy learned     
the difference between dream life and awaken life    
    
After finishing his education,     
the boy went to search for some job for him     
He struggled a lot but without much pain     
he came out of all the trouble as well     
He did very well in his education and career    
    
He chose to remain contented and wise     
He lived alone, in his whole life met many people     
but could never find the love of his mother     
Probably his mind was not ready to give his heart to others.    
    
Maybe he had fear of loss     
hence he didn’t give his heart to anybody.     
Maybe he still loves his mother so much     
that he feels she will come back.     
This is the way the boy learned to remain happy     
unconditionally and remain committed to one love.    
    
This boy has become old now,     
One day I met this boy at one place     
And asked him, you are so much successful, why are you so alone?     
He told me, who is not alone in this world?     
Some are alone in a crowd and     
some chose to remain away from the crowd.    
    
He asked me, why we need company?     
So that we can live happily with that person always?     
He further asked me is this a way of wise     
to look permanency and happiness and through a human?     
This way the same boy became wise     
and lived unperturbed even in the Tsunamis of life.    
    
He told me that one who has taken care of me     
up to this point in time     
In all ups and downs, good and bad moments,     
joy and pain she never went away from my heart    
    
She promised me to come back,     
but in fact, she never went away from me.     
When I need her badly     
I ask her to come and play with me     
and I always felt she is around me    
    
Protected me like a divine mother     
Perhaps only a relation of the mother can do this     
What other company I need     
when I have such a strong all time     
unconditional companion with me?    
    
Perhaps this is how the mother takes care of her children     
Even in her physical absence, no one can pain her children.     
This is the way the boy becomes a devotee.     
A devotee of a process called life.     
A devotee of existence around him,     
he calls this The Way of Mother.

# Article5017 : Nectar For Society    
tags: [ 'Indian Culture', Philosophy]    
    
Namaste,     
    
There are three kinds of human-looking beings.    
    
**One, who are common human.**     
Their whole time and energy are for their personal or nearest or dearest people.     
Busy in day to day work. Some take the comfort of life so seriously that they are too busy earning for the comforts.     
Some are not skilled or not having the right opportunity but still too busy with whatever they have in hand.     
But for all one thing is common in this group, Life finish work finish.    
    
**Second, who have tendencies of Sura, Devas, exceeding generous in giving.**     
They work and live for some cause.     
They think there is a mission in their life and they are taking it forward from previous generations.     
They know the next generation can take it forward if we put in the right effort till we are alive.     
These people are very powerful. Sometimes exerts their power but not always.     
They enjoy life and have the capability of doing hard penance to acquire energy, power and transform themselves and things around at will.    
    
**The third is Asura, which is not Sura (some people call them Devil, Rakshasa, Saitan, and other countless derogatory terms).**     
But if we have some understanding of Hindu Pauranic scriptures then we will not make this mistake.     
Asuras are not and never were Devil, Rakshasa, or Saitan.     
Asuras are very hardworking people and they can perform severe penance like Sura.     
They also work for a mission and has the power to transform.     
They enjoy life but for that, they need to trouble others or dull their own senses.     
Because they think if mind work or senses are sharp it creates problems so let’s park them for some time.     
Consuming all kind of food and liquid which increases their sleep and make their mind dull or sometimes aggressive.    
    
**How Three Kind of Human Exists Together?**    
    
Now see how they coexist in a society.     
Sura and Asuras are in a continuous ideological fight with each other.     
Common human pray to Suras to get favor and pray to Asura avoid their wrath and outrage.     
In this eternal fight sometimes Asuras win and sometimes Suras win.     
Sometimes Suras rule heaven and sometimes Asuras rule heaven.    
    
Heaven is a special place with lots of luxuries, where things happen at just wish or pressing a button.     
It is like a highly automated 100th generation super technologically enabled place.     
If you are the king of that place then even living being with you behave like an advanced AI Robot.     
They obey you 100% and take responsibility for the failure if they fail but never makes you upset.     
(Don’t run in the weird imagination of heaven in the sky. On a lighter note, it is like a mini version of 10 Janpath between the years 2009 and 2012.)    
    
Asura and Sura are fighting for political power so that from heaven they can control everything.     
Obviously Sura for their reasons and Asura for their own reasons.    
    
Self-praise and praised by others for their work is a need of all 3 types of being.     
It gives them the motivation to keep doing whatever they are doing.     
A mission beyond their life is common only in Sura and Asura.    
    
Sura gives to all who pray to them. They give whatever they have.     
Don’t give to others but never create trouble for those who are not praising them.     
There is a time and place for Sura’s workshop.     
A place for their praise is the temple and time Trikaal Sandhya.     
If you do not praise them then they do not threaten but they go in a passive mode of cooperation.    
    
Asura wants praise, all the time and all the places.     
They are a miser. Do more for themselves and less or none for others     
but want help or praise or awards for themselves.     
If you don’t give them as per their desire they are masters and experts in creating problems.     
They threaten others and not much help to others.     
If they help then they will help only to their community or their kind of people.    
    
If you praise a common person, once in a week or a month prayer is fine.     
They want it but don’t expect much because they know,     
Anyway, I have to continue my life without praise from others.     
He cannot threaten others nor can give a reward to others. Poor common person!    
    
Now see this fight in today’s context     
In America Democrats and Republicans are fighting     
In India BJP and Congress is fighting     
A common man in both countries is trying to align themselves with these parties     
Based on your understanding of the above text you can tag one party as Sura and another as Asura     
For you, if a ruler is of your ideology then he is Sura otherwise Asura    
    
Now try to understand this fight between     
Sura and Asura has not started around 2014     
When Trump or Modi came into power     
This fight is eternally going.     
People today complaining about society becoming more communal     
Scientific temperament is being fractured     
Education systems are being saffronized, and many other charges.     
It is a matter of time.     
Asura and Sura will always complain about each other’s way of working     
Whoever is in heaven will control the kingdom the way they are designed, their ideology.    
    
Now if something is eternally going then     
Why do you want to disturb your relation with your friends?     
Why do you want to abuse or curse the ruler or who is in opposition?     
Why do you want to be part of this fight anyway?     
If you still do then choose out of three human-like looking beings, who you are?     
I know you will either choose a common person or Sura.    
    
The outcome of Sura-Asura Sangram     
We need to understand that from time immemorial this Sura Asura Sangram is a must for the equilibrium     
This leads to churning a vast ocean of ignorance and which produces the following kind of wealth &amp; Ratna.    
    
**Amrita**: Nector for all     
**Lakshmi**: Physical wealth like gold, stock market gain, money for everyone     
**Apsara**: Science &amp; Technology of transforming and looking good and smart for everyone     
**Kamadhenu**: Path of high technological development for the well being of society     
**Kalpavriksha**: Care for the environment and flourishing nature around     
**Parijat**: Happiness for everyone     
**Dhanvantari**: Health for everyone     
**Airavata**: Powerful machinery for people in power     
**Ucchaishravas**: High-speed technology for special people     
**Kaustubha**: Wealth which only Sura (or ruler of that time) can possess     
**Sharanga**: Most powerful weapon which no one knows how to use for the good cause     
**Halahala**: Most powerful poison which no one knows how to handle    
    
We as common human beings need to be aware of this fight between Sura and Asura.     
Avoid participating in a fight unless we have a desire to become Sura or Asura.     
Don’t be panic about this fight.     
Don’t get indulged in physical or mental conflict with other common human beings.     
Ensure that Sura and Asura powers do not compromise the interest of common people.     
Ensure that Sura and Asura don’t have back to back handshake.     
Ensure democracy does not die so that common people can speak.     
No matter who rules, neither Sura nor Asura should go get disheartened     
That is the way of Nectar for Society

# Article5018 : Questions About Meditation    
tags: [ Mind, Mindfulness, Poetry, Vedanta]    
    
Namaste,    
    
Meditation is a process or result of a process?    
    
For some, it is both.     
For some, it is everything.     
For some, it is a verb and for others, it is a noun.     
There are people for whom it is a useless time waste,     
better do something more important.    
    
Is the English word meditation the same as Dhyanam word of Samskrut?     
Then what about Japam, Dharana, and Samadhi in English?     
What is the English word for Samadhi?     
If no word then what do you think     
why this word is missing in mapping to the English dictionary?     
Any deeper meaning?    
    
Can you mediate without Yama, Niyama,     
Asana, Pranayam, Pratyahara and Dharana?     
I mean can you put your foot on the 7th step on the staircase     
without putting on the earlier 6 steps?     
In upward movement, it is not possible,     
In downward movement, you may break your bones.    
    
Whatever you think about Meditation is your choice     
and the result of your choice has     
an impact on your experience and on your beliefs.    
    
Is mediation about making your mind thoughtless?     
Is it about thinking only one thing at a time?     
Is it is a way of being one with God?     
Is it about experiencing your freedom?    
    
What do you think is the meaning of freedom?     
Able to think whatever you want?     
Able to do whatever you want?     
Able to go, eat, talk whatever you want?     
Able to fly in the air with your body and run on water?     
Able to cross fierce fire and capture whole air in your mouth?    
    
Meditation leads to liberation, Moksha, and freedom.     
These all may be glories of meditation.     
But are you interested in these results for yourself?     
If this a goal of your mediation     
then you may return hopeless sooner or later from this journey.    
    
Do you want peace in your life through meditation?     
Trust me after you start doing meditation     
people will irritate you more to test you.    
    
And then say see your meditation is useless     
you still have anger, fight and argue with you.    
    
They will say,     
What is the use of your medication     
which is focusing and listening to gossip or     
TV serial playing in the hall etc.     
Better join us in the hall.    
    
All these impractical expectations     
will start piling up on you.     
You should be like a yogi in that photo     
They will expect that you become     
vegetable after meditation.    
    
So that they can do whatever they want with you     
You will be expected to become a messiah of nonviolence     
serve them another cheek to slap you.    
    
This way meditation will lead you to other kinds of problems.    
    
Better have good sleep, play sports,     
remain with friends and family members     
listen to them and work for them     
that is the better way of peace.     
What do you think?    
    
Is meditation about becoming     
something which you are not?    
    
If that is the case then it may be hard for you.     
You know your personality better than anyone     
and trying to become something else     
maybe torturing experience for you.    
    
If meditation is about knowing that you are peaceful?     
Knowing your day to day activities     
It may hard for you to swallow that fact.    
    
Is meditation means temporary rest to the mind?     
Then go for tracking, ride some mountain,     
walk in a forest that will do much better for you.    
    
You want to do meditation or learn meditation     
because this is a new fashion or     
a trendy buzzword today and in the 21st century?    
    
These were some questions on meditation.     
If possible dig more inside     
More you are puzzled     
More is the hope you will be settled in Meditation.

# Article5019 : About Astika    
tags: [ Concepts, Dharma, Philosophy]    
    
Namaste,    
    
Astika word come from a “as” “अस्” dhaato (root word)     
of the Samskrut (संस्कृत) language.     
It means “is”, “is-ness”, “reality of existence”, “being”     
It has nothing to do with belief. It is about reality.    
    
Believe means which I have not seen or experienced personally,     
And many people around me are talking about it,     
And I need to choose a side so that I don’t look odd in public, thus I have 4 options.     
1\. Either I believe with the people around or     
2- disbelief or     
3- be specious or     
4- be a seeker.     
And you need different mental metal for being     
either of these four regarding the subject in question.     
I will write about this topic on some other day.    
    
So, is-ness is about Astika.     
Now think about the term Astika?     
In my experience, there are 5 main categories     
(In categories I am little differing from the books of ancient wisdom,     
the reason for that is to connect with you)     
1\. World (samsara),     
2\. Scriptural Knowledge (Vedas),     
3\. God (collective one life),     
4\. Jeeva (individual life),     
5\. My Existence (Ahamkara)     
We will talk about all these in this order only    
    
**1. World, 2. Vedas, 3. God, 4. Jeeva, 5. Ahamkar**     
1\. Astika, 2. Astika, 3. Astika, 4. Astika, 5. Astika.     
It means experientially I am settled for all 5 entities.     
It means I am Poorna Astika.    
    
**1. World, 2. Vedas, 3. God, 4. Jeeva, 5. Ahamkar**     
1\. Astika, 2. Astika, 3. Astika, 4. Astika, 5. Nastika.     
Experientially I am settled for only 4 entities.     
It means experientially, I know that my Ahamkara does not exist.     
Is there this kind of person in the world? What do you call them? Bhakta?    
    
**1. World, 2. Vedas, 3. God, 4. Jeeva, 5. Ahamkar**     
1\. Astika, 2. Astika, 3. Nastika, 4. Astika, 5. Astika     
It means Experientially, I know that God (collective consciousness of the cosmos)     
doesn’t exist and everything exists.     
Are there these kinds of people in the world? What do you call them? Iswara Nastika?    
    
**1. World, 2. Vedas, 3. God, 4. Jeeva, 5. Ahamkar**     
1\. Astika, 2. Nastika, 3. Astika, 4. Astika, 5. Astika     
It means experientially, I know that Vedas are false and everything that exists is true.     
Are there these kinds of people in the world? What do you call them? Ved Nastika?    
    
**1. World, 2. Vedas, 3. God, 4. Jeeva, 5. Ahamkar**     
1\. Nastika, 2. Astika, 3. Astika, 4. Astika, 5. Astika     
It means experientially, I know that World does not exist (it is illusion) and everything that exists is true.     
Are there these kinds of people in the world? What do you call them? Confused?    
    
**1. World, 2. Vedas, 3. God, 4. Jeeva, 5. Ahamkar**     
1\. Nastika, 2. Astika, 3. Astika, 4. Nastika, 5. Nastika     
Are there these kinds of people in the world? What do you call them? Veda &amp; Ishwara Astika.    
    
This way there are 32 possible combinations.     
In those first is Sampoorna Astika and last is Sampoorna Nastika.     
I am not sure who can come in front and say I am Sampoorna Nastika.     
That person must be a complete lost case.    
    
Next time when you meet somebody     
and say I am Nastika or Astika     
And you are completely opposite to that person     
then don’t climb upon his/her head to prove you are right.     
Learn from his/her experience that how     
come she/he is such kind of person     
when there were other possibilities.    
    
So in the future do not fall into the     
the trap of English word believer or non-believer.     
This is a complete Western word,     
I will try to explain that in the future.

# Article5020 : About Peace Or The Peace    
tags: [ Concepts, Dharma, 'Ethics and Morality', Philosophy]    
    
Namaste,    
    
Peace and happiness in life is a desire of every human.     
Is it a goal of life, which we shall achieve one day?     
If you don’t have it then it may be a goal for you.     
Otherwise it a basic requirement of a human.     
We want to talk peacefully, eat peacefully,     
walk peacefully, sleep peacefully, and whatnot.    
    
The definition of peace cannot be     
argued but context can be. Why?     
Because the definition is your own and     
it is indicating towards resentfulness of your mind.     
Context is debatable because     
other people’s opinions come on the way.     
Everybody wants their festival celebration     
should be peaceful but others may think it is not peaceful for them.    
    
Every human thinks he is right and other is wrong.     
Every human thinks he is devata and other is Asura.     
In history, neither Ravana nor Duryodhana     
nor Shishupal nor Baali agreed that they are wrong.    
    
If these powerful contemporary humans and king     
didn’t agree on their wrongful doing     
then we are just a blade of grass.    
    
Day to day unrest of larger society lead to     
serious conflict and then fight and     
finally annihilation of one by other.    
    
Who became peaceful after the war     
of Rama, Krishna, Jesus, Mohammad, Hitler?     
(if you are emotional about keeping/not keeping     
some name in this list then wait, read and think,     
and don’t take me wrong)     
Who suffered in that war for peace?    
    
We keep weapons at home for what? defense or attack?     
Arms manufacturers are having a strong business     
and almost every American has     
some kind of weapon at his home for peace!    
    
In the north of India in villages, every well-doing family     
has a country-made weapon at home for peace!     
Nation develop a nuclear weapon for peace!     
They threaten to annihilate each other for peace!     
The human rights commission wants to preach peace     
and they themselves are biased and a bunch of hypocrites.    
    
The way of peace is war?     
Only a powerful win and gets peace for themselves.     
Winner writes whatever she/he wants in the history.     
That is why the history of war and peace     
should not be read from one book.    
    
Seeker of truth should read     
what has been written on different walls of the town,     
What has been written     
in the poems coming from the town,     
How the different literature and     
the behavior of the original people of the village     
or town is shaped post-war for peace.    
    
We read the history of the war for peace     
but the history is sponsored by the winning king,     
and we assume it is The Truth.    
    
In relation to the word “peace” &amp; “truth”     
we human are extremely hypocrite     
We talk about peace, organize conferences,     
give awards to others but “do” very little for “peace for all”.    
    
Similarly, we talk about the power of truth,     
we even go to an extend and say Truth is God.     
But we talk very less truth in our day to day life.     
Day to day conversations is full of lies.     
Day to day actions are full of conflicts.     
So Truth and Peace are for worship.     
It is our aspiration, it is our goal.     
Such a big goal that we have exported it     
to heaven call it divine peace!     
We are ready to kill others so that they get that peace.     
Sometimes in the name of peace     
explode our-self in the market place     
so that we get peace in heaven     
Oh human, what wisdom is this!    
    
Is it practically possible to establish peace for all human beings?     
Think, is it possible to establish peaceful     
living for all creatures in a forest?    
    
Only Lion can get a Nobel Peace Prize in the forest!     
Although a human being is only one kind of animal on this planet,     
yet because of being intellectual, social, religious,     
this single animal group has more diversity     
than all highly populated forest kingdom can have.    
    
Now think again, is it possible for all human beings     
to live together in a peaceful way?     
Talking about peaceful coexistence of all is like     
telling grass and dear and lion can peacefully coexist.     
Yes, but through conflict when one’s stomach is full.    
    
But a human does not only stomach problem,     
Here if you are hungry you have one problem,     
When the stomach is full you see dozens of problems     
Greed to annihilate all businesses around and     
become the greatest, the grandest, the best,     
the richest, the most powerful, the first     
is much more dangerous than stomach problem.    
    
To achieve all above all ways are fine!     
Because we are virtuous.     
Chosen by God. Directed by God.     
Who told you that?     
I don’t need any approval and certificate for that!    
    
I know my God from heaven told me that     
I am chosen being.     
My community is chosen one.     
My land is promise land, from here all go to heaven!     
This is arrogance in ignorance of human.    
    
You think back in the history of 5000 years of human evolution     
Millions of small or big, written or     
unwritten war happen on this planet for peace.    
    
In the last 100 years, 100 Nobel peace prize has been given.     
Which is the peaceful community?     
Which is the peaceful country on the earth?     
Does this prize go for a peaceful nation or community? No.     
It goes to a place where there is a conflict.    
    
TNT bomb is made by whom?     
Any relation of this person with the Nobel peace prize?     
Which person is responsible     
for the biggest conversion in India?     
Any relation of that with the Nobel Peace Prize?    
    
That is why it looks, peace is another political term     
Everybody wants it but at their own terms for other     
And at any cost for themselves.    
    
That is why in Hindu Scriptures we call there is     
an eternal Dev-Asura Sangram     
Sometimes Deva wins and sometimes Asura wins. No one is right.     
Asura has their own way of living and their contribution to society.     
Deva has their own way of living and contribution to society.     
Those who are Asura, like other powerful Asura,     
want peace for themselves, the Asura way.     
Those who are Deva, like other powerful Deva,     
want peace for themselves, the Deva way.    
    
What is Deva and What is Asura?     
Don’t break your head on this.     
Everybody calls himself Deva and     
opposite qualities of him as Asura.    
    
Sages have spoken written volumes on this,     
but when it comes to practice, I define myself the best way.     
Stories are ok, but I don’t think Ravan ever told that I am Asura.     
Neither you will be able to convince Osama bin Laden     
or Hitler in any argument that they are wrong.     
They were right, they wanted peace for themselves and their community.     
Others were Asura for them     
but they lost the war so the winner called them Asura     
and the winner became Deva.    
    
There is nothing right and nothing wrong,     
There is one eternal friction between two opposites in this nature.     
The friction is to bring peace for themselves.     
This is like equilibrium in a chemical process.     
Nothing at rest, nothing is right, nothing is wrong,     
Just countering each other in the name of Peace and Truthfulness.     
It is about the Peace but “Not the Peace for All”.

# Article5021 : Gate Of Mind    
tags: [ Mind, Philosophy, Vedanta]    
    
I am a prisoner of the mind     
Nobody forced me here     
I came here by accident     
I don’t know through which what gate I came inside     
Because today I don’t see any gate here     
When I came here I was a small child     
Absolutely nothing and negligible in the world.     
That is how I could have entered here     
playfully through any smallest possible window.    
    
Today I have become so big     
I am big in body, big in money, intellect,     
power, relationships, and all my possessions.     
I want to come out of this mind but I am not able to come.     
How can I come out of my mind when I am so big?     
The mind is a prison without any door.     
Only one very small window through     
which some light of life come inside.     
That is why I am living.     
I know I am living in my mind.     
I know I am not living in life.     
I am not living in the existential reality.     
The reality in which I live in is the creation of my mind.    
    
If I want freedom from this prison then the only hope is     
I should drop all my I-ness and my-ness     
Following this method, I will become     
the lightest and smallest possible     
And then I can run away from that small window     
from which light of life is coming in     
For that, I need to become as light as light     
As untainted as light.    
    
I can fly in that open sky,     
The sky without any boundary.     
I am boundless and the sky can live together.     
Because we both are boundless.     
That infinite sky is my home     
and eternal companion,     
because in real sense I am a life     
Which is captured in mind.     
My mind is like a hall of solid walls     
without the Gate of Mind.

# Article5022 : The Mind Is Friend Or Enemy    
tags: [ Mind, Philosophy]    
    
For any human being, his mind is     
either an asset or a huge liability     
Because this is The only and Final thing     
with which one enjoys or suffers,     
bounded or feel liberated in the world.    
    
If a mind associates itself with     
physical things and physical existence,     
like body, house, wealth, stocks,     
relationship, recognition, respect, etc     
then it has shorter joy and long-suffering.    
    
If mind associates itself with non-physical     
like consciousness, purity, compassion, unbounded love     
then it feels lighter, protected, free, and assured.    
    
But the problem is most of the times mind,     
because of constant feed from sense organs,     
associates itself with the physical world     
around and this has its own cost.    
    
Our five sense organs are important for our survival     
but the sense of freedom and bliss does not depend upon these.     
In fact, if we overuse our senses     
to see, to eat, to hear, to feel, to smell     
then it gets more entanglement to the objects     
and wants to go after those objects again and again.    
    
This sucks our energy and time and     
we never get the time nor feel important     
to allocate time to know and experience     
our other dimension of existence.    
    
Thus most of humanity suffers     
because of this great wonderful mind.     
Why? Because we don’t know     
how to handle our own minds.    
    
The mind can be used for both, survival and liberation.     
But sense organs can be used only for survival.     
Do not depend upon your senses for liberation.    
    
Our whole life efforts go on survival and surviving like others,     
But this is called competition.     
So we have made the competition a reality of our existence.     
If survival is the goal of life     
then where is the question of freedom,     
Moksha, liberation, and boundlessness?    
    
Can we use our mind without using our 5 sense organs,     
it means without getting involved in listening,     
tasting, smelling, feeling, seeing a shape, color, and form?    
    
Can we use our mind without getting sticky to memories,     
It means without hooking to the past and future.     
No nostalgia, hallucination, and imagination?    
    
It is not possible if you have not trained yourself rigorously.     
In a little tired state, you will quickly fall asleep.     
And it is not possible with a fresh mind.     
Because a fresh mind wants to out and search more.    
    
But in reality, this is possible and     
we have experienced this state by accident.     
We all have experiences of life     
when we lose a sense of time and space.     
Completely engrossed with an object.     
And engross so much that     
we do not know even our own presence.     
But unfortunately, this experience for most of us     
is accidental not in our control.    
    
Is it possible to live only in the present     
and only with experience?     
It means no accidental jump to past and future     
and no entanglement to the objects of senses.    
    
An absent-minded person is     
completely lost in the past and future,     
even after hearing, seeing at present.     
The mind is an enemy of such a person or not?    
    
But, what do call a person     
who at present willing stops     
entanglement to the objects around,     
not lost in past and future?     
Do not respond to any surrounding events.     
But live in that moment with full awareness and witness.     
The mind is a friend of that person or not?

# Article5023 : About Yagnya    
tags: [ 'Bhagwat Gita', 'Indian Culture', Philosophy]    
    
A process that has five elements.     
A goal, A sponsor (Yajmaan), A Performer (Purohit),     
A Deity (Devta) and Material (Havan Material) involved.    
    
Yagnya is not the Sacrifice of an animal     
Yagnya is not Sacrifice of even of a flower     
English word Sacrifice closely resembles the samskrut word Bali.    
    
A Yagnya is Satvik when the goal of Yajmaan is a public welfare     
A Yagnya is Rajsik when the goal of Yajmaan is self-glory,     
name, fame, and receiving wealth from the Yagya Devta for himself.     
A Yagnya is Tamasik when Yajmaan has not defined the goal or     
the process is not followed or dues are not given to rightful people     
and all which creates problems for everybody around.    
    
Every little Karma can be turned into Yagnya     
once awareness about the Karma rises in the Purohit     
So, Yagnya has a lot to do with your awareness,     
seriousness and emotions with the action in hand.    
    
Even a very mundane thing that is automatically happening in the body     
called breathing can become Yagnya.     
How? Once you have awareness!     
What awareness?     
Awareness of those five elements of Yagnya.    
    
1. Goal awareness- This Yagnya (breathing) is Giving life to all parts of the body.    
2. Yajmaan awareness- I am different from the body and it is my desire that this Yagnya should continue for the welfare of all.    
3. Purohit awareness- I have a mind and lungs they perform this Yagnya without being lazy to the process    
4. Deity awareness- Prana is Devta of this Yagna, I thank him for reciprocating my prayer    
5. Material awareness- Physical oxygen mixed air is required to perform this Yagnya. May this be pure and clean.    
    
Can we do this kind of Yagnya all the time and every time?     
It looks like this Yagnya is very economic,     
no need to earn thorough hardship and     
then spend huge on doing material Yagnya.    
    
But if you try doing this even for five minutes every day     
Initially, you feel this itself is very costly Yagnya.     
It is not easy to live in full self-awareness     
continuously for even two minutes     
especially for those who are starting this Yagnya.    
    
But trust the words of those ancient sages     
This the best way of doing Yagnya in your daily life.     
If you could do this Pranayam with Yagnya Bhava everyday     
It will bring lots of clarity, mental stability,     
body strength, and light heartiness to you.    
    
This way you can extend the Yagnya     
to other processes of life     
From eating, preparing food, walking,     
working, talking singing, listening to anything     
Just be aware of the five elements of Yagnya.

# Article5024 : About Relationship    
tags: [ Concepts, Philosophy, Vedanta]    
    
Tell me who is near to you?     
Your friend, brother, sister, mother, child     
with whom you live and share day to day struggle     
or your chief minister, Prime Minister or     
president or District magistrate?     
All these are names of our relations.    
    
But those who are not near,     
whether they are powerful or not how does it matter for you?     
To solve your problem once in a lifetime?     
And for that, you keep those always in your mind!    
    
Do you experience the relationship or nearness with God,     
The way you feel for your own people who are living with you?     
If no then God is not required for you.     
You are a practical person,     
You have managed your life without a president, the prime minister     
They are powerful but very far people.     
You have managed your life with those who are close to you.    
    
This is the reason sages and saints of     
Omkara Dharma traditions tell that be practical.     
There may be an absolute Brahmin of the Upnishads     
but our problem is not solved by that     
and we cannot share trouble and joy with that absolute Brahman.    
    
So they argued with each other for that one absolute God.     
But, a devotee tells I don’t care about that non-touchable,     
non-available, non-perceptible, formless God or Brahman.     
That is useless for me.    
    
Krishna is my best friend, Rama is my brother, Durga is my Mother,     
Saraswati is my sister, Shiva or Vishnu is my Father,     
This land Bharat is my Mother etc.     
These are very close in relation to me.     
And it is easy for me to please them as I do to my other relations.     
It is easy for me to sense that love in my heart for those relations.     
Mirabai, Soordaas, Kabirdass, Tulasidaas     
all great devotees chose a dear and near relation with their god.    
    
When Omkara Dharma people     
injected the concept of Murti Pooja and Prayer     
They knew human life will not get benefited     
if a human is not connected to the divine     
the way he is connected to his very close relations     
So when a devotee prays to Krishna as his friend     
He knows that same Krishna is a brother of another devotee,     
therefore I should not be unfair to my friend Krishna     
by asking him something which will heart Krishna’s brother.     
This is called Bhakti bhava.     
It is available in relation.    
    
What Bhakti you can have in that God     
Who is formless, colorless, like light,     
live in space far away from us     
Very powerful and very loving     
but cruel also when he torturers me or     
my family or people of my faith?    
    
This nonsensical imagination of God     
makes a sensible person giddy     
And makes ignorant to follow like a blindfolded person     
Who has jumped into a bottomless well!    
    
Therefore if you want to have God in your life     
Then it is always good to have him like,     
your very close relative and not like     
the president of your country     
On the other hand, if you do not have God     
in your life then that is much better     
At least you will not blame somebody     
in the sky for your pain and suffering.    
    
Abrahamic religions tell us that there is only one God.     
All others are false gods.     
Omkara Dharma tradition says we know all this for ages     
For the last two thousand years,     
you are not telling us anything new.     
This knowledge is it is part of     
our Upanishads since many millennia.     
This knowledge also has been     
a realization by many great people    
    
But we don’t care about that one     
because if God is like a chief minister or president     
who is not available because of far relationship     
Then, I am as an emotional being     
cannot connect to him     
then he is of no use for me.    
    
When my close relatives can solve my problem     
then why should I bother about that one who is too far?     
And no one around me knows him surely     
about that one God who is controlling everything from heaven.     
All are reading a book and telling me about that from their books.     
The problem is NOT the book.     
The problem is that they have put hard effort to memorize that text     
and now torturing me with that old illogical text     
which they themselves have not assimilated.    
    
So I feel joy when I meditate or sing or dance     
or feed someone who is close to me, nearer to me.     
At least he responds and gives me an opportunity to live with him.    
    
This mass prayer in a public place     
is just a tool for someone to gain and retain power.     
It doesn’t help me much     
until I am troubled badly by some external notorious forces.     
For me my Mother who is Durga, Kaali, Saraswati     
who takes rest in my money purse,     
on the alter in my Pooja room,     
whose photo is hanging on the wall     
reminds me always that She is around me     
Like the photo of any other close friend or relatives     
on the wall reminds me of their love.    
    
How much is the truth that she is protecting me?     
Omkar dharma tradition also knows that     
there exists an unbreakable law of Karma.     
My Devta or Devi who is my mother or sister or friend     
helps me sustaining both the pain and pleasure of this law.    
    
This relative of mine will never bend the rule.     
We don’t expect magical or unnatural things from this power.     
That is how Omkara dharma tradition and science can coexist.    
    
From where we got this notion of God doing magic?     
only one God, one culture, one language, one tradition, one law.     
This is a western concept.     
They developed it because it fitted them for many centuries to rule.     
This “one” is the language of a ruler.     
To consolidate the power so that management is easy.     
It is the ruler’s perspective. That has some value.    
    
But as a human, society, and culture     
we never want to be governed by another human, society, and culture.     
There are enough powerful forces within the society     
who can balance other parts so that individuals can live sensibly?     
But this is possible only in a democracy     
Where human is valued and human is a seeker     
Not when human lives like a dog     
with blind faith in written books or merciful master.    
    
In Indian traditions, every relation has a name     
No matter how far is that relation     
Whether the mother side or father side,     
From wife side or husband side     
One generation back or 4 generations back     
There is some unique name for it    
    
This is the impact of western culture upon us that     
All relation has dried for us     
Or they have a plain simple name.     
a name like uncle, aunt, mom, dad, bro, sis     
And sometimes shamelessly referring     
to parents with their first name     
Even our sacred and pure relation     
with our Devi and Devta has become relation with God!    
    
This God has come in public life.     
My Devi or Devta is my private matter     
I don’t know who is God, nor bother about that.     
My Ista Devata or Devi is not available for public discussion     
It is my sacred and pious relation    
    
We are the land of the seeker     
We are the land of practical people     
We believe in using everything in a very sensible way     
We believe in interacting with everything in a sensible way    
    
We don’t care about old white long gown wearing person     
hanging in the sky and controlling this world     
We feel in our experience that     
If I go to the forest with my cows     
my Krishan comes with me and protects me and my cows     
That is the power of a relationship.

# Article5025 : My Creator    
tags: [ Mindfulness, Philosophy]    
    
There was the time     
When I had no eyes but could navigate the world better     
When I had no ear but could listen to the conversations better     
When I had no heart but feel the emotions better    
    
There was the time     
When there was no light because I didn’t have eyes     
When there was no sound because I didn’t have ear     
Who said that the creator created light and sound before eyes and ear?    
    
But there was the time     
Because I had the mind     
In the mind, I had all my accumulated karma packed in the seed form     
And I was navigating the world    
    
There was no god     
because I had no devotion     
I was navigating the cosmos to manifest myself     
To create myself again at my will    
    
But can I create myself at my will?     
Especially when I had a time and a mind with packed Samchit Sanskara.     
Neither time was in my control nor my seed     
This seed is my mind which I create myself    
    
Then one young girl and boy came together     
They created a body     
Out of their will or at the will of their parent’s     
Out of fun or out of social competition     
I am not aware, I don’t know, I will never know the truth    
    
I was interested in my truth and manifestation     
So, I chose that body     
After some time I was delivered to the world     
In a fresh new body     
This I “did” to manifest myself     
That was my first karma of this life.    
    
Now I had eyes which I could open and blink     
Now I had ears which I could use to listen     
But only to those who are near to my physical body    
    
Those who created a body for me     
I called them my parents     
But more then I could know that they are my parents     
They knew I am their son!    
    
Slowly, my parents and people around them educated me     
And I started feeling that they are my own     
Only they are mine!     
I belong only to them!     
Whatever is there is mine!     
Whatever is mine is of only theirs!    
    
This way I started creating myself     
One who was formless has a form now     
One who had all karma in the seed form     
Started exhausting karma, seed started become a tree     
And simultaneously started new karma,     
Without knowing that these karma are creating     
the seed for my next manifestation     
So tree created other seeds    
    
So who is my creator?     
The physical body is created by my biological parents     
The mental body I already had     
with this, I chose my physical body     
And consequently my parents.     
After coming to this planet     
I created myself every day     
By eating the food which comes to my plate     
By assimilating the ideas     
which are thrown upon me from all around the world    
    
So with the help of relations     
Which I called parents, guru, friends, brothers &amp; sisters     
I created myself     
Was there any choice in this creation?    
    
That question comes only when     
you do not like the circumstances you are in.     
You don’t ask this question when all is joyful around you.    
    
There are very few who keep asking this question     
Even in the moment of joy that     
Is there is any choice for me?     
Is there any free will?     
Who is in me, who is happy?     
Who is in me, who is sad?     
Who is in me, who wants to grow &amp; become big?     
Who is in me, who wants to flow in the space without wings?     
Who is in me, who doesn’t want to die?     
Who created me?    
    
The beauty of these questions is     
Everybody will get his own answer     
So never ask these questions outside     
Keep searching, without getting settled to anyone answer     
Life is not an exam that you pass or fail,     
If you are not able to answer these question     
Or you will get A+ grade for the best answer    
    
So, I bless &amp; pray for all     
that you keep asking these questions     
And you never get the answer     
which will settle in your whole life.    
    
You cannot ask these questions to others to settle yourself     
If you get an answer from another that is bookish for you     
Your answer is that which you get from your own travel     
Travel ends only at a cremation ground    
    
What will you do even if you get the answer to these questions?     
What will you do even if you get settled with answers?     
So my prayer is you never settled for these questions     
Who is my creator?     
What did you say God in heaven?     
Then you are tricked by someone!

# Article5026 : Who Is Athiest    
tags: [ 'Atheist']    
    
Completely unaware and ignorant of the competition     
of the various religions, gods and their followers     
I was resting on the lap of the Truth     
The Truth was protector so I never bothered to take risk     
of waking and then running in the world for doing some karma     
Because I know I am a child,     
I will make mistake and follower will torture me     
What else can be a more protected place     
to live than the lap of the Truth?    
    
It must be dawn in the sky     
and David, my close friend came to meet me     
He told me that if you don’t believe Jesus as the son of God     
As your savior then there is no hope for you.     
It looks you are an atheist and you are going to go into eternal hell.    
    
I told him I don’t know who is god,     
Nor am I aware where he lives,     
Neither I have seen the birth of Jesus     
How can my belief in something     
for which I am completely unaware,     
someone can push me to eternal suffering?     
Humanity is already suffering     
not because of belief or not belief in Jesus.    
    
I heard about Jesus,     
He had good saintly qualities     
He walked on this earth     
Did many good karmas for humanity,     
so I have very high regard and respect for his work.    
    
But, truly I have not seen God.     
Why are forcing me to believe that,     
that saint was the son of the God     
A God whom I don’t know     
You want me to believe in God     
And then believe further that Jesus was his “the” son?     
If God exists then why am I not his son?     
My friend got upset and left me alone in his hopelessness    
    
Once upon a time, I was walking in the garden of the Truth     
My friend Salim saw me puzzled and came inside the garden     
He wanted to help me     
He asked me, what happened,     
why are you looking so puzzled?     
I told him the story of my friend David.    
    
Salim told me in a compassionate voice that forget him.     
You need not worry about those people.     
Those are false people, they are killers of Jesus.     
But I have good news for you.    
    
“The” latest version of the message of the God     
was given to Prophet Mohammad     
It is written in a book, which I can give you.     
If you understand that book and live life as per that book     
then you will go to heaven     
Otherwise, this world is controlled by the Saitan     
And you will definitely go to eternal hell    
    
I told him this world is already suffering.     
But not because people have not read your book     
There are many who have read that     
People have understood that book thoroughly     
And trying their best to do as per the book.     
That doing is causing a problem to humanity     
Not the book reading or understanding    
    
After understanding that book     
Why don’t you yourself do something     
To make this earth a beautiful place for all human     
But don’t force me to read something more     
And then do something,     
And in exchange for that     
your book will promise me some unknown beautiful land.    
    
I asked Salim, how reading a book make sure that I can follow the book?     
Information, knowledge, wisdom, and enlightenment all are not the same.     
During this conversation, we both are in the Garden of the Truth.     
Why we need to believe something     
which is not in our experience and beyond our comprehension?     
If you have patience then talk to me logically and from experience.    
    
Why my belief is going to determine eternal hell or heaven for me?     
As if my karma not enough.     
Have I done any harm to Jesus or David or his God?     
Have I hurt you, your book, your prophet, or your Allah?     
Then why and who can illogical punish me?     
This cosmos is not so dumb and idiot to punish an innocent.    
    
He tried to convince me but failed and finally told me that     
Although you are a good man     
But you are Kafir and I feel pity for you that     
A good person like you will definitely go into eternal hell.    
    
Now I was very much puzzled     
My two friends who think so much about me     
They want to ensure that I should go to eternal heaven     
but I am not complying with their belief systems and their books     
Nor I am interested in dying for the sake of heaven     
Therefore they are feeling helpless for me.    
    
Yes, I am an Atheist     
Till my senses and intellect is working     
I cannot allow dogmas &amp; believes to subjugate them     
I live on the lap of Truth     
I want to see the Truth and realize the Truth.    
    
Yes, I do not know many things     
But I am ready to understand.     
If someone explains me logically     
I am ready to put my best efforts     
to understand the Truth of life     
I am not interested in your concept of     
one time death &amp; going to eternal heaven or hell    
    
I know after I die I will leave this body here     
Because this body is my loan from the mother earth     
Without body, heaven and hell is of no value for me     
I don’t care about your food, virgins, and wine there.     
Those interests I could never develop even in this life.    
    
As far as heaven and hell for my soul is concerned     
I know I am eternal I will never die     
I will come again, as per my Karma     
I will come again, like a leaf come again     
to the tree after falling at the feet of the tree     
I may not know that I am the same     
but this tree may be knowing.     
But I am not concerned about that also     
As long as I don’t know my true nature,     
No one can help me,     
books are external.     
After I know myself, I don’t need any help from anyone.    
    
Yes, I don’t believe in Shiva sitting on the mount Kailasha with his family.     
Yes, I don’t believe Vishnu sleeping in the ocean and Lakshmi sitting pressing his feet.     
Yes, I don’t believe Brahma an old white beard god is hanging in the sky because his job is over.    
    
If your definition of Theist is to believe     
in some book and your imaginative stories of hell and heaven,     
in your loving, caring, and cruel God,     
in your stories of god created the world in seven days and then taking rest.     
Then I don’t have shame in saying that     
I have not surrendered my intellect &amp; intelligence.     
It is not going in my head.    
    
But “my friend”, Truth, knows I am a theist.     
I believe in the Existence of life because I can experience this.     
I believe in the Law of karma because I can rationalize this.     
I believe in Dharma because it binds me to my duties.     
I believe in the Mother because her love guides me and protects me while living.     
I believe in the Guru because his guidance shows me the right path in life.     
I believe in the Friends because their presence makes me feel that I exist and I am valuable to them.     
I believe in Death because I have seen many passing before me.     
I believe in the Wisdom of ancient books because they do not disconnect me from the reality of the world.    
    
The truth of Vedanta is Life for those     
Who do not care for hell and heaven.     
Who do not care about God and Saitan.     
Who do not care about the rise and fall in life.    
    
Only those who are bold can see in the Eyes of Truth directly.     
Very few are blessed who have an opportunity to walk with the Truth     
This comes at a price.     
The price is you have to drop your dogmas and believes.     
The habit of saying untruth and pleasing people     
The habit of remaining slept for the whole lifetime.     
The habit of pretending you know when you don’t know.     
And cowardliness of not living the truth which you know.    
    
Yes I am atheist as per your worldly definitions     
But I know, I am the child of Truth     
And Truth is never Atheist    
    
What did you say?     
Because I am theist therefore I deserve a place in heaven?     
O man I am already in heaven     
you around me polluting this heaven     
So please go to earth where believer lives.

# Article5027 : The Final Settlement    
tags: [ Philosophy, Vedanta]    
    
A man from a village,     
Met me after so many years.     
I could recognize him as my childhood friend Pratibimb.     
We together were very happy to see each other.     
We decided to spend a whole day together,     
At a place that was free from the hustle-bustle of the city.     
So, we went to a hilltop near the city.    
    
After settling there on a hill rock     
I asked him what are you doing?     
Where are you nowadays?     
Where are you settled?    
    
As soon as he listened the word settle     
he became a little nostalgic.     
After some time he told me     
Oh, settlement! I will tell you my journey,     
and then he started.    
    
I am a child from a very small village of this nation     
After education, I moved to the city to earn my living     
There I got a lot to learn and little to earn     
Here in this city one day I am met, my cousin     
He asked me, brother, what are doing?     
When are you getting settled?    
    
I told him since the last three years I working in this city     
Changed my jobs three times     
because of reasons beyond my control     
I never complained about those but I wanted to get settled.    
    
I am trying, but it is not happening     
In spite of all this, I am happy     
Because I have learned so many things     
in a short time in this strange city.    
    
My cousin told me learning is fine     
But where is the earning?     
See me. I am almost the same age as you.     
I am having a good job, making good money     
Recently got married and taking care of my small family     
I have settled before you.    
    
I said I am not against settlement     
But that is not my control.     
Although I am more qualified educationally than you     
but you are more qualified than me     
to give the answer to the question of settlement.    
    
He told me that I should keep     
my learning side by side and focus on earning.     
Look Opportunity to earn, learning will happen there     
and even if doesn’t happen that is fine     
Because, how long we will keep learning we are getting older?     
Getting settled is more important in life.    
    
I was puzzled over this conversation     
I was seeking the answer to my settlement     
I tried hard for two more years,     
but more than newer experiences of life I didn’t get much.    
    
Whenever I got a new job     
I got a new domain to learn     
I will pay money from my pocket     
and after job hours in the evening burn my nights,     
register for courses, diplomas &amp; certificates     
and learn that domain and get certified.     
This way journey kept going on.    
    
After two years I moved far away, from that city     
There was a new environment so more learning     
Thus new jobs, new places and     
working with new people was my way.    
    
Then came the time when my father asked     
Are you settled, the reason was obvious.     
I told, I want to settle but I am not able to settle     
He asked me, how long it will take to settle?     
I had that standard reply     
It is not in my hand,     
But I am happy I am learning.    
    
My father told me all your friends and cousins     
got settled but you are accumulating     
education, knowledge, degree, experience.     
What is the use? Get settled my son.     
All can happen parallel.     
Learning doesn’t stop in life, even if you get settled.    
    
I was like a wandering monk     
Kept moving alone, from one job to another,     
From one city to another     
Only with my wisdom     
But always happy     
Some get settled with a place     
Some get settled with money     
Some get settled with relations     
I was settling in myself.    
    
The question of settlement is thrown to me     
Whenever friends, colleagues, relatives are around     
**Where** are you settled?    
    
Probably by this time they assumed that I am settled     
That is why the question is “Where”     
Today on this beautiful hill     
Can I ask you a question?    
    
I said, well you are my childhood friend     
We are very close to each other     
You can ask me anything     
I will give my best reply if not true     
I quizzed him.    
    
He smiled and told     
Can you please tell me,     
The meaning of settlement?    
    
I was happy that I finally     
he is asking this question to a wise person like me.     
I got the opportunity to give wisdom to my best friend.    
    
So, I started speaking to him     
Without stopping, I continued for fifteen minutes     
But more I was speaking     
more emptiness I was experiencing in me     
Finally, I told, I have spoken a lot     
This is what I know and I meant by the settlement     
But I am also not happy with this answer.    
    
He told me, if you, who is settled,     
do not know the answer,     
Then how come who is rolling like a ball on this planet will know?     
Yes the desire to settle was there in me     
But now that desire itself has settled.    
    
Oh, I said, how come your desire of settling     
got settled before you settle in your life?    
    
My friend told me     
For me, life is a journey     
This life is just a station in that larger journey     
For me, neither life started at my birth     
Nor it will end at my final departure from the body     
I will continue in some other form at some other place    
    
So, tell me a place where I should build     
a palace for my permanent settlement?     
Many times I have built big palaces earlier     
and I got kicked out by the time     
This time I am thinking of not building any.    
    
Everything is taken on rent here     
Never try to buy anything     
Take everything on rent,     
Use it with respect and then give that back to the owner     
Thank giver for giving me the opportunity to use    
    
I am no more than a custodian     
of those things with which I enjoy life     
Once done then leave surroundings and objects     
around in good condition and move on.     
So that others after me can enjoy this planet.    
    
I took my mother womb on rent     
so that I can manifest in physical form.     
My mother helped me,     
I came out from that settlement and thanked her     
Then my father gave me his house to live and study     
I studied and came out and thanked him    
    
Several people have given me their houses in the cities to live     
I lived in their houses and moved out and thanked them     
Several employers gave me the opportunity to learn and earn     
I worked, earned, and learned. I thanked them and moved out    
    
In fact this body, I have taken on rent from this mother earth     
On top of that, daily I take some more loan from her in the form of food     
But daily I thank her     
She allows me to walk on her chest     
And do whatever best I could     
She took my weight and side effects of my living here     
She tolerates my ignorance every day     
So one day I will say a final thank you     
for this body to the Mother earth.    
    
Mentally I am settled, I am happy     
So settle that I do not have anything to lose, so no fear.     
So settle that I can work as hard as a donkey     
without bothering day and night.     
So settle that if I have to leave this body right away on this hilltop     
I am not afraid, I know I will come back     
and restart again around the same.     
Lapse of few ten-twenty years here and there will happen     
But in eternity that does not matter.    
    
In this life,     
No desire to build an empire     
No desire to give big donations &amp; building big temples     
No desire to live a lavish life     
But a strong desire to work hard with this body and mind     
To learn, understand and experience life in the best possible way     
Thus I keep moving    
    
Now tell me in this continuous migration     
how to get settled &amp; where?     
It looks, I am settled for a constant     
whose name is “the change”.    
    
As my friend was puzzled many years ago     
I am puzzled today. Why?    
    
Because I thought settlement means     
Having a big apartment in the best society in the city.     
Having children and Giving them the best education.     
Helping them getting settled in their job &amp; life.     
Buy the costliest car and show it to my friends.     
Take all of them on a long ride and enjoy yourself with them.    
    
Before getting old and dying,     
see all the place on this planet,     
as if this the first and last time here.     
Because they are saying “Jindagi Na Milegi Dobara”     
And if possible go and see the moon also.    
    
Eat everything and drink everything possible,     
because that is why God has created     
all these things for we human     
Apart from that human is also creating     
so many interesting technologies to enjoy     
It is not for me then for whom?    
    
But for all that I need to make lots of money     
That is why I working so hard.     
And this crazy man is saying     
I am finally settled in this constant changing world     
I don’t see that he got settled     
Still roaming, nothing fixed.    
    
Finally, my friend told me     
Hari, this whole cosmos is mine     
Based on the need, I can live wherever I want     
When this whole cosmos has been built for me     
And I can live wherever I want,     
The only thing is I need to take care of is my Karma,     
Then where is a question of creating a house     
inside the house to get Final Settlement?    
    
O merciful Reader, if you are settled in life     
Can you tell me whether my friend Pratibimba is foolish or wise?     
Because I asked him a question and     
now I myself am trapped in that question.

# Article5028 : Sources Of Evidence    
tags: [ 'Indian Culture', Philosophy]    
    
Suppose you have vast land and no one around you.     
For you living you want to work in the field     
and you do not have any tool,     
any knowledge about how to dig the earth,     
how to put seed and how crop come,     
how to cut the crop and how to treat the field after cutting the crop     
then what will you do?    
    
I know you did’t follow me.     
Because that is not your profession in 21st Century.     
Suppose you are in office,     
some work has been given to you     
but you don’t have access to the processes, tools, knowledge-base     
and other skills within the organization     
then what will you do?    
    
This is the reason that     
to do a work effectively, efficiently in a systematic way     
it is important to understand the complete framework.     
Training or not, you have to search, learn     
And get the work done.    
    
Now, i you want to know the unknown     
then what is the framework?    
    
This is the base of today’s discussion.     
Today’s discussion comes from my understanding     
of our ancient wisdom tradition.     
Since time immemorial,     
it was extremely important for the sages of Bharavarsha     
that they should know the truth.    
    
They were bold enough     
to renounce everything and sat in forest     
to know the truth.     
This kind of courage for Truth     
is rarely seen among contemporary     
of that time in other part of the world.    
    
Even today this kind of courage     
is missing among the most of the people of Bharat.     
Convenience is our Truth and God.     
With whatever work can happen,     
life become happy for the time being     
that is the great thing,     
for most of the people of this time.    
    
After lots of debates and discussions     
ancient scientists come to the conclusion     
that there are six sources of evidence     
which can help us in knowing and reflecting the truth.    
    
Even today all over the world     
these six are famous     
and know with different names     
depending upon the language.    
    
But, I don’t remember any tradition     
who is open to seek the truth through all the six means.     
Most of them are settled with two or three kind of evidences.     
Only Advait Vedantins or some section of Mimashika people     
apply all the six to verify the truth.    
    
This is quite complex and critical to summarize     
in this short essay     
but to give you a perspective     
I can say a lot has been debated, weighted,     
contemplated, preached over this topic.     
Text like Patajnjali Yog Shutra, Nyaya Sutra     
are greatly influenced by this idea.    
    
It was important for king to know this     
so that they can deliver justice.     
It was critical for professional to know this     
so that he can understand and expand the knowledge base of their profession.     
It was critical for renounced     
so that he can understand the real nature of existence     
around and within them and be liberated.    
    
Different people applied this framework for different purposes.     
But Advaita Vedantins used it to proof     
that there is no duality in the world.     
This world is not created by anyone.     
“This world is that who created it.”     
At one level of existence mass and energy is same.     
And both has come from no-thing.     
This no-thing is consciousness     
This is very lofty idea of Advaita Vendata     
After millions of years research that is their conclusion.    
    
Today’s physical science’s march towards the String theory     
Is trying to conclude the same     
Which is concluded by Advaita Vedantins     
using these six sources of evidence    
    
You can call these six as source of Evidence     
or six tools to gain the knowledge     
about the objects, events and relations around us.    
    
They said if you want to know the truth about anything     
then you should look that from different angles,     
sources and validate that using different techniques.    
    
Once it passes all the tests     
then only it can be called true knowledge     
otherwise it may be just your belief or illusion around.    
    
For that they have given us six sources     
from which conclusion can be derived.     
Many traditions even in Omkara Dharma     
does not follow all these six techniques.     
Abhramic religion also does not rely     
on all these six sources of knowledge     
or sometimes heavily only on one source.    
    
Similar is the situation of today’s modern science.     
Based on your experience     
you can share with me     
which source of knowledge is predominant     
in your life or your work domain.    
    
Now, what are those six.    
    
First, Direct evidence- “Pratyksha”:     
It means our senses are in direct contact with the objects.     
What our five sense organs can show us     
that becomes the source of knowledge for us.    
    
In day to day life, you know about the objects     
using this technique, because your senses touches them.     
Eye touches color &amp; form, ear touches sound etc.    
    
But sometimes no matter     
what finer equipment we use to see, hear etc     
we cannot know the reality.     
For example while living on this planet     
no matter what sense we use     
we will never know that earth is revolving     
in the space at mind blowing speed     
of 67000 miles per hour around the sun     
and on its axis around 1000 miles per hour.    
    
Second, Inference – “Anumaan”:     
If we know the relationship between two     
and one we can see     
then second can be inferred from logical deduction.    
    
We know if fume is there then fire must also be there.     
If sky looking blue it must day and sun will in visible sky,     
If there is water in the glass under the tree and nobody around     
it means some human lives around here.    
    
In these cases if we see the effect we deduce there is cause.     
Note: Reverse is not true.    
    
Third, Compare – “Upmaan”:     
For example you have seen a object in the market     
but you don’t know what is that.     
Then one day at your friend’s house     
you find your friend is using that kind of equipment     
and you ask him what is this and he says it is VR camera     
then because of comparison     
between this and that which you saw in market (now in your mind)     
you conclude that what you saw in market was VR camera.    
    
Fourth, Postulated – “Arthapatti”:     
You called your friend and then go you to his home.     
You knock the door but door is already open.     
You call him, search inside but he is nowhere.     
So you sit in the hall and wait for him. Why?     
Because you postulated based on the evidences     
around that he is not in house,     
he must be nearby and he will come soon.    
    
Fifth, Absense – “Anuplabdhi”:     
If you call to school and ask that     
you want to talk to you child and     
principal says he is absent today     
you conclude he has gone somewhere else,     
either movie or to some friend’s house.    
    
So absence of object at a place     
gives you knowledge that boy is at other place.     
But you don’t deny his existence.     
Because based on other sources of knowledge     
you know he exists but where you need to search.    
    
Six, Trustworthy person or source – “Shabda”:     
If some Nobel prize winner is medical science     
in cancer research is saying something     
about the cancer treatment &amp; symptom     
Then you trust him.     
You make his work the basis of your further research.     
You can quote him and his work freely without doubt.     
Or some articles published by Albert Einstein in 1950     
can be referred to base your research     
even if, he is no more physically live around.    
    
In first time reading, it may be confusing for you.     
Trust me, I was like you few years back.     
So nothing new, in this.    
    
Every sources has its limitation.     
No one is complete.     
That is why to get the full picture all should be used.    
    
Today I don’t want to make it complicated for you.     
If you are more interested in this then search on your own     
or let me know I will expand this in future.     
This is very interesting topic for the seekers.

# Article5029 : Who Is Guru    
tags: [ Education, Guru, Guru Purnima, 'Indian Culture', Philosophy]    
    
We all know the Samskrut definition of Guru     
The remover of darkness.     
But whose darkness?     
How does he remove?     
What is this darkness about?     
What is the meaning of remove?    
    
In Omkara Dharma tradition,     
Knowledge &amp; Wisdom has been so important     
that from the time immemorial     
Many people came forward.     
At the time of leaving for the cause of Knowledge &amp; Wisdom     
Some of these people had comfortable life and some didn’t    
    
But, one thing was common.     
The concern for the humanity and selflessness     
Selflessness means they didn’t start new journy     
for their personal gain and glory    
    
Concern for humanity means     
Compassion, love, respect, forgiveness     
is diminishing among the human of society     
People in the society are becoming so     
Self-centrist that whether this life or post death life     
They just look for their comfort     
That too at the cost of other around them     
So, to bring the society to the     
center of humanity    
    
Guru is not a proper name it is a common name     
It is like prime minister or president     
Whoever fill that position is called prime minister     
But prime minister is position of democratic system     
Guru is position which is neither democratic or self procalimed     
It always existed in the Omakara Dharma tradition    
    
According to different Sampradaya     
They say first Guru is Shiva or Vishnu or Brahma     
Some wise people say they all are same     
Some say they are different position     
Some even say they are not proper noun     
But common noun.    
    
A power which destruct is Shiva     
A power which maintains is Vishnu     
A power which creates is Brahama     
But these powers are not physical in nature    
    
Like if your remove a person     
from a prime minister position     
What happens to person? He becomes common man.     
What happens to power? It remains.    
    
Either cabinet exercise or     
new coming person will exercise that power     
So, even if we keep people away,     
To whom we worship     
These powers are eternally there    
    
From our ancient wisdom stories     
We know that the powers and position     
to create, maintain and destruct were     
never filled by any individual     
like Indra’s position was filled by powerful kings    
    
We know from traditions     
that these three powers always existed     
They are not human nor they are human like     
For meditation or worship we give them     
the form which most suites to our mind    
    
Interestingly in Omkara Dharma tradition     
Either Vishnu is Adi Guru or Shiva is Adi Guru     
But Brahma is that first power     
who got the wisdom from the Adi Guru    
    
From the wisdom He created the world     
But even he is not Adi Guru     
He is called Guru     
That is why famous sloka     
Guru Brhama, Guru Vishnu, Guru Devo Maheshwara    
    
In the entire system of Omkara Dharma     
From the time immemorial     
uncountable number of people     
who have come forward and     
refined the body of knowledge    
    
The purpose was not to create new book     
Or copy right or their worship from common people     
The purpose was to give direction to the society    
    
Bharadwaj, Vishamitra, Vashista,     
Veda Vyasa, Patanjali, Gautam, Kanad,     
Siddhartha, Rushabhadeva, Mahavir Jain,     
Chankya, Adi Shankara, Guru Nanak,     
Kabir, Tulasidas, Ramkrishna Paramhamsa,     
Vivekananda, Dayananda Saraswati is just starting list     
Your can write a book just with names of these people    
    
Unlike other religions which are history based     
Omkara dharma never ever bothered about time and history     
For us person was not important     
For us time was not important    
    
We don’t care whether Gandhi said or     
Krishna said or Buddha said     
We don’t care when it was said     
We care and worship that     
Who did enough Tapasya     
And based on his wisdom     
What he did versus what he said?    
    
Whatever was done by him     
whether that was inline with our Dharma or not.     
Whether based on the need of time     
that was contextualized or not     
That was important for us    
    
Unlike today’s time when most of the people     
Have lost touch with ancient knowledge-base     
Some has knowledge about the book     
But they cannot contextualize    
    
Some people try but refer to some old book     
so many times that public start feeling     
why are you going so much back in 21st century     
It is not about the respect, but about the connect.    
    
We need to understand people in Omkara Dharama     
At any point of time never bothered about     
What is written in book.     
We were never book driven society     
Tradition of writing came very late.    
    
When knowledge base was getting lost     
Because people were dying and     
entire chain of knowledge getting wiped out     
So, we understood the importance of documenting    
    
Otherwise, we were very practical     
We always question.     
What is there for me if I do that?     
Then what is there for my people, my tradition and my Rastra?     
If you tell them it is written in such a such book     
Such sloka and such page they will laugh at you    
    
Since few centuries, our mind has been conditioned     
Because of western education &amp; western influence     
All the time referring to people.     
Who said what, and what is written in which Holi book,     
which chapter and which page number    
    
That is why, today when we share quote     
We mentions, who said that,     
As if it copy right problem or     
they know that they do not have courage to say that     
or practice that and people will laugh     
so it is better to use name of some Holi book     
or some great philosopher or scientist    
    
Have you ever seen great Upanishad text     
being referred which Rishi said that?     
Either people do not remember what is written there     
Or they do not remember who said what     
Or people have read so much English text     
that they feel filled and enlightened    
    
Guru of anytime were those people     
Who took this bold charge     
They left their personal comfort     
Because they had deep pain in their heart     
They came forward to give direction to the society    
    
Did society accepted them?     
You ask yourself,     
did Rama, Krishna, Buddha, Mahavira, Kabira,     
Mirabai, Vivekananda or any Guru lived a unopposed life?     
Never ever! when they lived they had     
enough opponent to keep them on toe    
    
They struggled enough but never     
Deviated from their path     
We worship them not as individual     
But as Guru-Satta, Dharma-Satta    
    
Because of their efforts and sacrifice     
We are here today in 21st century, as a thriving civilization     
Otherwise we could have been finished thousand years back    
    
Where are original habitat of America, Europe, Africa?     
They all are killed, finished!     
Where is their knowledge system?     
All digested by ruler and new religion!     
Why? Because these societies had great people &amp; great minds     
But they couldn’t produce Guru    
    
A person who is punching bag of the society.     
When a guru lives     
He gets punch from his family members     
his friends, pupils, opponents, society     
And in today’s time even from media    
    
But these are the people who don’t care about anything     
They even don’t care about     
their personal name, fame, gain &amp; business     
If it is there it is fine     
If it is not there that too is fine    
    
In ancient time also     
Guru control king but lived in forest     
They ran universities but never lived in luxries     
They ran business but not for themselves     
They ran hospitals but not for making money     
They offered several social program not for their TRP    
    
All was to comer forward and lead from the front     
So that other take inspiration and do it right way    
    
In today’s time our mind is conditioned that     
Guru is Godman, he gets power from god     
Therefore he should not do business     
Should not indulge in politics     
Should not do social reforms     
Should not live in society     
They should live in forest like some ancient people     
This is all media coined definitions &amp; expectations from Gurus    
    
This all is being pushed upon us by self-interested western forces     
If we have concern for society and Rastra     
Then we should be very careful     
About such interpretation     
That what Guru should do and what not     
We are not frozen society     
who will follow what is written in Holi books.    
    
We do what is needed     
That is the why Guru becomes punching bag of the society     
If they start following Holi books word by word     
and Remain cut from everything     
and let the society, politics and business     
go to the dogs then western interest group will be happy,     
because they get opportunity to fill the space.    
    
We should never ever be prejudice about the people     
Look what they are doing     
Look what we are doing     
Can we renounce and become punching bag like them?     
Can we help them?    
    
If nothing then remain silent     
We have lost the ability to preach if we cannot practice     
It is not cricket game that by watching commentary     
you teach Virat Kohli how to play a six    
    
It is about taking society forward     
Keeping them alive at the cost of a life called Guru     
Don’t speak against the tradition of Guru Shishya Parmpara     
It has given us our identity     
But at the same time we need to understand     
That Guru is not a person     
It is not a proper noun, It is a common noun     
Who ever fill that space becomes Guru     
Ask yourself, who fills that space in your life.    
    
If you find none then     
Either you are the greatest of all time     
Or a selfish of height     
Or an ignorant about contribution of others     
Or an arrogant or a commentary maker     
Or an ungrateful for the lifes of past and present     
who have given you opportunity to breath     
in today’s vibrant democracy     
In all cases you have to think,     
what is missing in me,     
which made me like this.    
    
On the occassion of Guru Poornima of 2019     
I offer my these words as a Pranami     
to the entire Guru-Satta    
    
Who kept their personal life & comfort aside     
And drove out us from darkness to light     
The light of the life that exists today     
The light of the live festivals and events     
The light of the joy &amp; happiness that in spite of     
we billions people, we are living     
as one tradition of thousands of inter-woven traditions    
    
The light of wisdom of balancing old wisdom with current challenges     
The light of wisdom of remaining context sensitive and not dying in books     
That is why our society is not in frozen in books    
    
Thank you my Guru for being part of my life     
Inspiring me all the time     
Giving me hope and purpose     
and being my punching bag     
Enduring all the pain given by me and society     
Because you lived for Dharam and not for yourself    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Yours Truly Hari     
    
# Article5031 : About Silence And Listening    
tags: [ Mind, Philosophy]    
    
Hearing is a **natural phenomenon** to normal ears.     
Listening is a **conscious phenomenon** from a willing mind.     
It is possible that with a normal ear I can hear but not listen.     
And it is also possible that with a deaf ear I may not hear but listen.    
    
When our mind is busy talking     
or preparing to talk for our turn     
We miss the point,     
because we couldn’t listen.    
    
We may not listen     
when nothing is being said     
And we may not listen     
when people are shouting at us.    
    
We can listen when     
we are sensitive to the voiceless.     
We may listen when     
we are cooking assumptions in our minds.    
    
We may not need a doctor to tell us,     
what has happened to us     
If we can listen directly from our body,     
but do we have that mind, who listens?     
All-time chattering mind can not listen.    
    
We don’t need a judge to tell us that     
we have done injustice     
If we can listen directly     
from our conscience     
that this is the time to take punishment.     
But are we that much honest?     
A prejudiced mind cannot listen.    
    
Can our surrounding talk to us?     
Of course, without an instrument of speaking,     
Tree, wall, street, plants, and objects     
in our surroundings can talk to us!    
    
How do we know they are talking?     
Sound is the vibration in the medium     
which we can hear all the time but     
An insensitive mind misses listening.    
    
When a frequency is too low     
we are not able to pay attention to listen.     
It is like listening to a mute person     
We need to listen with a lot of patience    
    
But this skill payback a lot     
Because a surrounding     
which is tongueless     
Always vibrates the Truth     
And this helps us knowing our truth as well.    
    
If we can tune to the objects of the surrounding     
then we can listen to the truth from     
the food on our plate     
the Moorthi at Pooja alter     
the Photo on the wall     
the Objects in the room     
the Tree on the way and     
From the flower in a garden.    
    
A sound can be voice or music or noise     
But, what is the difference among all these?    
    
Voice belongs to life.     
Music belongs to instruments and nature.     
And noise is multiple voices and music     
get mixed up and humans not able to make sense.    
    
Voice and music makes sense only     
When it is coming from the silence     
But when voice and music is coming     
with another voice and music     
then it is noise and not music!     
You cannot enjoy that longer.    
    
The sound which comes to our ear     
Which is created by public festivals or prayers,     
May be music or noise     
It depends upon our state of mind or faith     
For some, it is pleasing, and for     
other it may be entertaining or     
and for the rest, it may be paining.    
    
Have you spent some night or day     
In a forest or near a forest?     
All the insets and birds are talking aloud     
In a rhythmic way     
We cannot understand the voice     
but we enjoy the rhythm.    
    
Have you ever sat under the tree     
When slow air is flowing?     
There is a sound from the leaves of the tree     
This is a music of nature     
We may not understand but we enjoy that.    
    
Have you ever sat at the bank of a slow-flowing river?     
There is a sound of water,     
lives in the water jumping on the surface     
and creating a music     
And it soothes our mind    
    
Have you ever thought     
Who is the mother of the sound?    
    
What did you say?     
The object which is making a sound?     
oh, then you missed the point.     
It comes from silence!    
    
More the silence better the sound     
Between the silence, there is a small sound     
we notice that which is between silence     
And miss that in which sound is packed.     
Silence is omnipresent,     
It does not live in the sound     
Sound lives in silence    
    
Can you listen when you keep speaking?     
The more you speak less you listen.    
    
So, you listen when there is silence.     
The silence of a mind is called peace.     
The silence of an environment which we enjoy     
is called the rhythm and beat of nature.     
A rhythm of flowing air, chirping birds,     
running water, and dancing fire.    
    
Between two sounds in the surrounding     
Between two thoughts in the mind     
There is silence.     
In fact, this silence is so universal that     
We can say that between the two intervals of silences     
there is a spike of sound and spike of thought.    
    
Without listening to anything     
from the surrounding     
Without listening to any sound     
from your own mind     
Can you listen to a possibility     
of music in the silence?    
    
Silence is mother of Sound,     
It is like darkness.     
From silence all sound takes shape.     
Frequency is the shape of the sound.    
    
From darkness even light takes shape.     
Frequency is the shape of light.     
And in the presence of light     
objects in their shapes are visible    
    
Sound can be identified only     
when it displaces the silence     
Light can be praised only     
when it displaces darkness     
Without darkness and silence,     
what is light and what is sound?    
    
What is that which is all pervasive in existence?     
Even present at the place     
where the light of the sun     
can’t reach in the sky.     
And no air exists?     
It is darkness and silence.    
    
What is that on the back of which     
light and sound play like a child?     
It is mother who is dark, Kaali     
It is father who is silence, Shiva    
    
Our non stop talking and     
showing off to others,     
Make us sick to ourselves     
and to others around us.    
    
Thus take a rest while     
keeping body on the lap of Kaali     
And head on the lap of Shiva.    
    
Have you ever thought     
In the night when you get extremely tired     
and fall on the bed.     
What is that which picks you immediately     
from your body     
and takes you to a no man’s land     
And in the morning     
drop you back again in your body?    
    
Just after waking up     
From a deep sleep     
someday ask yourself     
where were you two minutes back?    
    
And in answer don’t refer     
to the body and say I was here on the bed     
but refer to one who enjoyed     
the travel to noman’s land     
In silence and darkness    
    
O Pratibmba, one who could listen     
and enjoy the music of silence     
Can communicate with unmanifest     
Can communicate with unfolded time     
Can know the formless cause of creation.

# Article5032 : Who Is The Best Friend?    
tags: [ 'Bhagwat Gita', Mind, Philosophy, Vedanta]    
    
Pratibimba is my childhood friend,     
One day I asked him     
In your mind what is the best example of friendship?     
He paused for a minute and told     
Arjuna and Krishna’s friendship is the best.    
    
I asked him, how come?     
Krishna is God, Arjuna is Human,     
Krishna is an incarnation, Arjuna is Devotee,     
Krishna is Guru, Arjuna is Disciple     
Krishna is Yadav, Arjuna is Kshatriya     
How come these opposite you call them best friend?    
    
He said, have you read Gita?     
I said with pride, of course, I read a book named The Gita.     
He asked me which Gita you read.     
I said, what do you mean by which Gita, there is The Gita?    
    
He said, Hari, there are 60 odd different types of Gita     
The famous one is the Bhagwat Gita.     
It is called so because the Guru in the Gita is Krishna, the Bhagwan     
Thus the song of Bhagwan is called Bhagwat Gita.    
    
He said Krishna and Arjuna are the best friends     
and cousins at same the time.     
Do you know any other example,     
Where out of the two best friends or cousins     
One is Guru and the other is ardent Disciple?    
    
In spite of all the ups and down in their individual lives     
They remained together &amp; helped each other     
At one end, Arjuna is the greatest warrior of his time     
On another end, Krishna is a mystical personality     
One of the sharpest, compassionate and tricky mind to understand     
Both are extremely tall in their persona.    
    
For the cause of society,     
they know how to utilize the skills of each other.     
Even with all his might, Arjuna was never king.     
Even with all his mystical powers, Krishna was never king     
But they together did whatever needs to be done     
at the time when needed.    
    
In today’s time if we have might     
then we lose our mental balance.     
If I know more than my friend then     
I will play all the dirty tricks which can hurt my friend.     
But Arjuna and Krishna showered their all     
whatever they had on each other     
Arjuna didn’t hesitate in asking anything     
Krishna didn’t keep anything close to his chest     
Arjuna didn’t leave any stone unturned,     
if it is a command of his friend Krishna.     
And none of them worked for their personal gain    
    
Where is the place when two such strong powers,     
come together and stay together.     
They respect and listen to each other.     
They stand and support each other.     
And most of the time,     
It is Krishna who is in giving the position     
But Arjuna in receiving all with utmost Shraddha    
    
Krishna didn’t need money, Arjuna didn’t have     
Krishan needed love and respect and     
Arjuna could give that which he had the best    
    
On the other hand, Arjuna knew     
I am a younger brother of Yudhistera     
So, I will always follow him     
I can never become king,     
Even Krishna cannot make me king     
And for my survival what I need     
I can earn with my might     
But to live a happy life     
I need the support and wisdom of Krishna     
And Krishna never hold himself back    
    
Many children have been named Krishna     
And many have been named Arjuna     
In the hope of their Mothers     
that their Children will meet someday     
to their eternal companion and friend    
    
But where is the austerity of Kunti, Devaki, and Yashoda?     
Where is innocence, respect &amp; love which Kunti’s Arjuna had?     
Where is the compassion, care,     
and a mind merged in the oneness with Brahman,     
which Devaki’s son had?     
In politics, corporate, spiritual, and family life     
we don’t find this kind of combination of friends    
    
Where is that Krishna today     
Who makes promises and keeps his promise at any cost?     
Where is that Arjuna who can hear     
with such attention even in the terrible war field?    
    
No matter how strong we are when we are in the war field     
We know the limitation of the body and mortality of the body     
So, we are feared because of our death     
That time Arjuna refused to fight,     
not because of the fear of his personal death    
    
But because of some reasons, which we in society call     
Brotherhood, care for women, respect for elders     
The sin of killing of my own clan     
And seeing the futility of the war!    
    
Where is that Arjuna who asks the following question     
to his friend in a time of deep trouble     
and listen to him with absolute attention     
What is a steady mind?     
What is real knowledge?     
What is that which forces us to do what we normally end up doing?     
What are Dharma’s characteristics?     
What is Prakruti, and its role in making us the way we are?     
What is the difference between Sanyasa and Tyaga?     
Normally, in today’s time, these questions vanished first     
When we see a huge calamity before.    
    
Where is that friend who after giving his best advice     
Tells that, this is all, apply your own mind and choose now!     
Since the time of Krishna &amp; Arjuna of Dwapar     
Many but countable people have come and gone     
Who accumulated lots of wealth and comfort     
Earned a lot of fame gave their best possible to the society     
But that kind of friendship we never have heard     
It looks creator creates     
that kind of friendship only once in the cosmic cycle

# Article5033 : The Way To Learn    
tags: [ Education, Philosophy]    
    
What is the food of a mind?     
No matter how good is the food     
you cannot eat it more than your stomach size     
Whether food is free or prepared,     
purchased or prasad from a temple     
There is a limit to food.     
After eating, we get settled for some time.    
    
But, what about the food for the mind?     
All the time mind is searching for food     
Never getting settled     
Sometimes get tired but that     
can be managed by context switching     
And changing topic     
those are different sources of getting mind food.    
    
What are we looking whole day     
either in books, TV, newspaper,     
phone, youtube, blogs or social media sites?     
You guessed it right. Food.    
    
Our mind is searching for food for himself     
Whole day variety of food for the mind     
Without giving any food,     
It is not easy to set your mind at rest    
    
Till we are awake either body     
is looking something through mind     
or the mind is looking for itself.    
    
But why mind is looking for food all the time?     
Does it want to know more?     
Does it want to Experience more?     
Or simply it is never trained     
to simply sit and watch the breath!    
    
A mind can search the whole day and get tired     
but still like it and     
then the next day go again.    
    
It is not that easy for mind to search in awareness and with breath     
Why? Because, there are high chances     
That normal mind will completely get lost     
In pure awareness of the self     
And normally mind is not ready to get lost.     
For him it is defeat!    
    
How mind explore, learn, and get absorbed?     
Focus on breath and you will learn about the body,     
Focus on dynamics inside stomach     
and know what is going inside.     
Look on the moon and mind explores the same     
And sometimes tearing a leaf or flower,     
Like a child in curiosity for what?     
Exploring, learning, and experiencing!    
    
Generally in the context of mind     
we say search inside or outside     
But the mind does not have that kind of boundary     
It is spread everywhere.     
For mind outside is inside, if it absorbed!     
And inside is outside,     
if it is able to inspire the surrounding.    
    
Learning in human life is the core process     
It gives us survival capability.     
Ability to choose between flight and fight     
But this is available to all creatures     
Through the learning of millions of years     
Our body cells have that infused knowledge.    
    
Using a mind for survival is too much overuse of the mind     
It is like using a heavy weapon to kill an insect     
For human, a mind opens the gate of realization.     
Something which cannot be directly sensed, perceived.    
    
A journey of learning starts in our life     
when parents guide us,     
we may learn or fail to learn there,     
then the teacher teaches us and we fail or pass in the class,     
Our friends and society teaches us continuously,     
From this, we may accomplish something or not is immaterial.     
What matters is we are learning and experiencing.    
    
Daily we observe lives around,     
without the help of any other being.     
We see some patterns and try to assimilate,     
the meaning of happenings.     
We may succeed or fail to assimilate that learning.     
But mind keep trying with one more step    
    
How do we know that we have learned?     
when we see contrary patterns     
Or we do something and     
the outcome is not as expected     
Then we learn that we have not learned enough     
Or we not learned correctly    
    
Learning is a life long process     
Therefore even if you learn wrong     
Or you make a mistake     
There is nothing wrong,     
In making mistake or doing wrong.     
But the condition is you should be self-aware     
An awareness which is free,     
From the guilt of mistake and fear of blame    
    
Ancient wisdom traditions say     
One-fourth of learning come from a teacher     
One forth from friends and society     
One forth come from experiments     
Final one forth come with time, passage of life.     
There is no shortcut for the fourth    
    
The source of learning is the question     
Not the borrowed question!     
But those which made you sleepless and restless    
    
Depth of learning doesn’t depend upon     
How much we have read     
But how much we could assimilate     
Assimilation of knowledge is not possible with borrowed questions    
    
The best teacher in life is a question     
If by the time children finish their education     
Teachers can teach them how to ask questions,     
Related to the subject of their interest     
Then we can say a college education is complete.    
    
A Master degree doesn’t mean I have become a master     
But it means by now I know     
that how Limited I know     
And this is the door opening for new life.    
    
Our teachers should tell us that     
An answer is that     
which settles some aspect of life.    
    
But no matter, How much you read     
It will not settle any aspect of your life.     
You need to move to next step.     
Reading and Listening conditions us.     
Is reading or listening bad?     
No, it helps us in asking questions     
But it happens to a seeking mind     
Asking those questions on which we can put our life     
And seek the answers on our own     
No copy and paste of guru, book, notebook, teacher or parents    
    
Why do we fail to ask the right questions?     
Because we are in a hurry of generalizing knowledge.     
This takes us away from the context     
And we fail to understand correctly.    
    
We need to understand generalisation     
in knowledge is a very heavy load process.     
We need to have huge experience and knowledge     
before we generalize the idea or concept.    
    
How should we ask questions?     
The way a child asks, with inquisitiveness,     
perseverance, trial, application     
And all on the self!    
    
If I learn anything in such a way     
that my wrong understanding can cause     
Serious loss to me or my dearest     
Then I will never fail to learn correctly.     
Thus, we should keep in mind that     
the right understanding is important.    
    
Why do we fail to learn correctly in class?     
Because we don’t know,     
The consequence of poor learning is     
A bad doctor, engineer, pilot, politician.    
    
Why do we fail to learn?     
Because of borrowed questions.     
Because of no relevance to the questioner’s life.     
Because of no context.     
Because of no application.    
    
So learning is important.     
But how to learn?

# Article5034 : What Is A Positive Mindset    
tags: [ Mind, Philosophy, Poetry, Vedanta]    
    
What is positivity? What is positive thinking?     
What is a positive mindset?     
Why is positivity so important?     
Why is negative hated so much?     
What is positivity and what is negativity?     
Is there any plus or minus sign on the events,     
people, thoughts, places, around us?    
    
Despite there is no sign on the objects,     
How do we recognize this is positive and this is negative?     
And how come one thing which is negative is positive for others?     
And something positive is negative for others?    
    
Negative or positive is not absolute characters in nature.     
They are two opposite poles of an infinite line     
These opposite poles can be called negative or positive     
This imaginative line doesn’t have     
distinct negative or positive at any specific place.    
    
On this imaginative line to decide, these are two opposite sides     
You need to know the location of the center     
But on the infinite line, you cannot locate a center     
Every point is a center on an infinite line.    
    
Have any seen negative signs on an electron?     
Has anyone seen a positive sign on a proton?     
Has anyone seen a positive sign on a laughing face?     
Has anyone seen a negative sign on a bitter face?    
    
From our experience, we know     
earth exists, earth has north and south pole     
We know the earth has the magnetic character of south and north pole     
But no one can point a location on the earth     
that from here north or south pole of magnet starts.    
    
So negative-positive, good-bad, day-night they look like the contrast     
and they exist in our experience,     
but our experiences are based on relativity.     
Even after heavy use of this word “absolute”     
There is nothing absolute in our experience!    
    
How easy it is to say think positive     
when you are in the kitchen and boiling milk spill over the stove?     
when you are drinking coffee and coffee falls on your new clothes?     
when you are hungry; eating your food     
and that time your food plate falls from the table     
and there is nothing else in the kitchen?    
    
when you were rejected by the interviewer in the last round?     
when you missed your flight for a critical business meeting?     
when your customer gives you zero-rating     
for your work, product, or service?    
    
when you hear from your partner or children,     
what you have done for me?     
when somebody hits your car, abuses you, beats you,     
and wants compensation because he is a big person     
and his big car also got damaged as yours?    
    
If we cannot think positive in these situations, then     
for what purpose this positive thinking preach is given?    
    
Is positive thinking about hoping for happening which you wish?     
Is positive thinking about hoping against all the hope?     
Can positive thinking be enforced?     
Can a positive thinking mind be cultivated temporarily?    
    
Is it a normal functioning of the mind?     
Is it about stopping old negative thinking habits of a mind?     
Is it possible to stop negative thinking? How?     
Does your mind even know what is positive or what is negative?    
    
A mind is a faculty like the heart or lungs or eyes.     
It works on inputs, without bothering what is the input.     
It is the Dharma (nature/duty) of a mind to think.     
It is the Dharma of the lungs to clean the inhaled breath.     
It is the dharma of the heart to pump the blood to body parts.     
Mind, lungs, and hearts process whatever is available to them.    
    
Is it possible to have a positive mind     
without developing a habit of deeper thinking?     
Without understanding the deeper meaning of events,     
objects and relations around?     
Foolishly people think deeper thinking causes problems.    
    
A child was eating groundnuts from a bowl     
and the bowl falls on the ground.     
Bowl is broken, groundnuts spread on the entire room,     
and the child is crying.     
Mother says don’t worry,     
I will fix that but can you tell me many groundnuts I gave to you?     
The child says wait I will count.     
The child counts and collects all groundnut in another bowl.     
Mother cleans the floor     
The child learned to see the meaning of the event.    
    
The kitchen is just cleaned,     
A housewife preparing tea for her family     
tea spill over the stove and makes the entire area dirty     
finally not enough tea for all members.     
Mother says you have not offered food to fire for long.     
Today if one cup of tea is offered to fire then feel blessed.     
After Havan, we need to clean the floor.     
So, we can clean the kitchen in that spirit.     
She further says sharing, when you have less is a sign of love.     
Anybody can share when it is enough     
So the lady redistribute the same quantity among all     
Lady learned to see the meaning of the event.    
    
A person who was out of his job for six months     
Was rejected in his fiftieth interview     
He comes home and writes his diary     
Thank you, God for letting me know that     
before I get the best job for me     
I should know these things also     
which my interviewer told me     
That person is learning to see the meaning of the event.    
    
We need to understand the difference between     
hoping against hope and positivity.     
We need to understand, taking everything in our control     
and then expecting now things will happen     
as we want is not about positivity.    
    
We need to understand, leaving everything to god     
and then quoting from scriptures,     
poems of great devotees and philosophers     
that God will do everything     
This is not positivity.    
    
A positive mind is neither lives in helplessness.     
Neither it is endlessly waiting and hoping for what it wants.     
A positive mind is not about being foolishly happy.    
    
A positive mind is cultivated by your     
own long, continuous, sustained efforts.    
    
A positive mind is cultivated when you start     
giving joyful meaning to the events.    
    
A positive mind is about how to be joyful     
in whatever is happening around us.    
    
A positive mind is about how to     
look at events from a different perspective.    
    
A positive mind is about how to seek     
and then give larger meaning     
to the events happening around.    
    
A positive mind is about never becoming bitter for anything     
no matter how dangerous was that.    
    
A positive mind is about thinking constructively     
and giving a befitting response without being     
bitter or attached to some event or person.    
    
A positive mind is not about surrender to the situation.     
A positive mind is not about the devotee’s mind or the enemy’s mind.    
    
A mind that uses past and memories     
but never get hooked to the past in some nostalgia.    
    
A mind that uses future and imagination     
but never get hooked to any fear, anxiety, and excitement    
    
A positive mind is a stable mind.     
So, don’t become prejudice in your mind     
And expect it shall do something and shall not do others.     
Don’t expect mediation will solve the problem.    
    
O mind! don’t think negatively.     
O mind! think positively.     
O mind! stop thinking now.     
Giving these kinds of instructions never ever helps.    
    
O God, O Gurus now I am out of control of my mind.     
So you take control of my mind!     
In some extreme situations, it may work.     
But on day to day basis never let your mind to be a slave     
of other’s thoughts and ideas.     
Do not allow your mind to surrender.     
Surrendering ego is a completely different thing     
than surrendering your capability to think.    
    
All this is possible if your mind is the mind of a seeker     
A mind that is ready to learn     
A mind that does not want to test others     
A mind who is unconditionally interested     
in the inner joy of mind &amp; life.    
    
O Pratibimba, know what kind of mind you have!     
Why you become bore when people are not around you?     
Why you get angry when things do not happen as per your wish?     
Why you become anxious about the future?     
Why you miss that this moment     
when you are reading these words is     
the only true moments and all other     
are your just memories and imaginations.     
So, develop a mind that is always joyful.    
    
Until Next Time Stay Blessed

# Article5035 : Human And His Faith    
tags: [ Philosophy, Poetry]    
    
If you look at life deeper,     
There is no other purpose of life other than to live.     
We make a purpose, work hard for it,     
If the purpose is fulfilled, then celebrate it,     
But that purpose is Human created!    
    
The creator doesn’t have any purpose.     
The creator is playing.     
The purpose of play is nothing but to play.     
Win or lose against someone is a human purpose.     
The creator does not have anyone against whom     
The creator needs to compete.     
The creator is alone and the lonely player.     
We all creatures are being used by Creator to play.    
    
It is like, you are alone in a forest and most powerful there.     
You live there and play there.     
But animals in the kingdom think that     
this person has a purpose     
that is why he does certain things     
one day and other things on the other days.    
    
Lila of the Creator is such that     
you will never know what the Creator is trying to do.     
The only way to know Creator is to think like Him.    
    
With respect to the existence of the Creator.     
There are the following types of people in the world    
    
1\. Those, who believe there is no Creator.     
Like many self-made successful educated people,     
who think that they struggled hard     
to achieve and to become what they are.    
    
2\. Those, who don’t know there is something like Creator.     
An unaltered naive small child is like this.    
    
3\. Those, who don’t bother about Creator.     
People busy enough with their work are like this.    
    
4\. Those, who bother too much about Creator     
and want to influence him in their favor. Like a trader.    
    
5\. Those, who bother too much about the creator     
and believe Creator is very powerful     
and that Creator cannot be changed     
so don’t spend time making him happy.     
Just be careful while living.    
    
6\. Those, who don’t bother about their work or life     
but only about Creator’s work.     
What creator should do or what he should have done.    
    
7\. Those, who think Creator has a purpose     
and whole life thinking what may be the purpose of the Creator.    
    
8\. Those, who know Creator is there     
and know it from their experience     
and not from books and imagination of their mind.    
    
From your experience do you know     
any other Types of Human Being based on their Faith,     
or with respect to their thought about the creator?

# Article5036 : Which Metrics Does Really Matter?    
tags: [ 'Philosophy for Business', Poetry]    
    
Whether our general knowledge     
or our value system     
What we want to know or value looks something like this.    
    
Who is the richest person in the city, country, world?     
Who is the most influential person in the city, country, world?     
Who is holding a particular position in the organization, city, country, world?     
Which is the Highest GDP country or state?     
Which state has the Highest literacy?     
Which state has the highest level of education?     
This way there are hundreds of metrics     
Which are in place and we need     
to mug-up them to look smart!    
    
These are the metrics that are easy to count     
Because lots of data is there     
Commonly agreed formulas are there in place.    
    
But tell me, in the life of an individual or common citizen     
what is the use of learning this kind of metrics?    
    
There is a tool called media analytics     
There are people who get benefited     
either by earning after doing so     
or getting a name when this is done.    
    
But we common citizens, reader     
What we get out of it?     
Except a desire to be something else.     
Sometimes in ugly form, this is called motivation for others     
Why I am saying ugly because you try to copy someone     
and then end up saying its not my cup of tea     
that person is really great     
I am nothing before him.     
Or we say without being corrupt     
you cannot be successful like him.     
I am not like that.    
    
In this spirit, we forget to understand that     
With a hammer, you cannot stitch cloths     
It doesn’t mean hammer is bad     
It only means it is being used for the wrong purpose     
Every individual need to discover their own path     
And travel that without copying     
even closest person in your field of work    
    
Why don’t we create metrics which matters for all     
By following which there is no such kind of stress among human     
By achieving those metrics     
people are able to relate better with others and live happily    
    
We should create metrics     
To measures those characteristics of human,     
And rewards the individuals for achieving those metrics.     
Some metrics are like below    
    
A person of the highest integrity.     
A most peaceful selfless hardworking citizen.     
A person with least or zero bank balance but huge impact creator.     
A most loving person who can speak the truth on the face without fear.     
A person who spends the most time with the unprivileged.     
A person who created technology that improved the lives of millions of poor.     
A person who inspired thousands of children to come of depression     
and helped them to follow their own life and passion    
    
The issues with this kind of award are     
It is not easy to measure the said behavior     
But we know, it matters a lot to all     
The lazy human mind always jumps for low hanging fruits     
Highest return on the lowest investment     
And this applies to the domain of rewards and recognition as well    
    
Tell me what will I get     
If I remember the name of all influential,     
rich and powerful people of this world?     
Still, my struggle to earn my next bread is the same.     
What are the **important metrics** of life    
    
Someone said it inspires him!     
Ask yourself, it really inspires or creates a vacuum,     
which is later filled by undesirable emotions of a human?

# Article5037 : Who Is Ravana?    
tags: [ Dharma, 'Indian Culture', Philosophy]    
    
## The Raavana 2.0    
    
Pratibimba got a temporary power     
A power to travel the time     
and then make others to travel the time along with him     
At that very moment, Pratibimba chose to travel to Treta Yuga     
He met Raavana,     
This is the time Raavana is in war with Rama     
But not killed in the hands of Rama.     
Pratibimba brought him along with him to the twenty-first century.    
    
Pratibimba asked Raavan,     
Why are you so arrogant, selfish, angry young men     
which caused you to do whatever you have done?     
I heard you are Brahmin of Treta Yuga     
Who knows all the Vedas, Jyothisha, Ayurveda, War sciences, Upanishads,     
knows good and bad conduct     
knows good and bad policy.    
    
Even after knowing all this     
You supported the wrong people,     
You did all which was controversial     
And for that, you got punished     
And your name is so infamous that     
even after many millennia no family chooses     
the name of their child after your name.    
    
Raavana said, what you read in Ramayana is Raamleela.     
It means the play of Rama.     
If it is His play he can play the way he wants.     
I am just a side hero of that play.     
You made me a villain.    
    
Ram is the Great of course,     
but highlighting my wrong actions     
Ramayana again heightened the virtues of Rama.     
So, Rama’s good deed makes him great     
but my bad made him the greatest.    
    
Whatever happened in my life,     
For me, it was not Leela     
For me, it was real life     
My study, struggle, desires, fight and result of fights,     
Win and lose all were real for me.    
    
But in the 21st century when I see back     
I feel that I have been used in the Leela.     
Used to show what all was wrong with me     
As if I was nothing but wrong.    
    
I am a typical guy in North India     
I am a resident of Meerut     
I am an ambitious, hardworking, devotee of the Shiva     
I am Brahmin and worked hard to achieve what I had     
Nobody has given me on my plate.    
    
In my life, I have done right and wrong as per the society     
I never realized it is so wrong     
Nor got opportunity to think and     
reflect my deed in a respectful way.    
    
In Treta yuga, they tried to outcast me     
and in Kalyuga you tried to outcast me     
That is why south Indian politicians have caught me     
And leveled me a Dravidian     
And you couldn’t have courage     
to stop and save me from them     
You thought anyway Raavana is bad     
so let him be taken by anyone whoever wants to take him.    
    
This way I was wrong in Treta Yuga     
and I was wronged in Kal-Yuga     
And today again because of no fault of mine     
I have become part of the dirty politics of the Bharat.    
    
I thought at least after my death     
I will be able to unite my Sanatana Dharma     
but even after my death     
When I have known my truth     
You people are playing Leela on my dead     
You are not allowing my bad to die permanently.    
    
I am part of Sanathan Dharma     
where Jeeva takes infinite birth     
do infinite karma in those births     
But was never thrown in the eternal hell     
or heaven for the Karma of one life     
And in one of those countless birth     
finally, one day I become one with the Cosmic being.     
But you are pulling me back again and again.    
    
If I am given a second opportunity to correct and     
to relive life then nobody can play with me     
I will be in control of my emotions, desires, anger     
I will be able to use these for my benefits and     
for the benefit of people around me    
    
In the last many years I have learned     
how badly the world sees you     
if you get played wrong by someone     
Or if you become part of some other person’s Leela.    
    
If I have to relive again.     
The name of the play will be Raavan Leela.     
And it will not be any less adorable &amp; inspiring     
than Ramleela of Balmiki Ramayana    
    
But in Kalyuga who will write and appreciate     
that kind of Raavanleela for me     
Because in 21st Century people     
of north, south, east, west     
are busy blaming Rama and making him a villain     
But I know I was wrong and He was right.    
    
Today when I am feeling to relive a life of Rama     
You are not giving me an opportunity     
Because you are singing the glory of that Ravana     
Which I knew was not on the path of Dharma.    
    
The time was over, Raavana vaporized in the air before Pratibimba     
Pratibimba still thinking about what has gone wrong with our society     
That Dharma looks Adharma     
and Adharma looks Dharma     
People in the society in the name of Dharma     
arguing in the favor of Adharma     
And this they call freedom of speech.

We know from time to time     
and place to place above four     
for below activities will change     
In spite of that each time when you are hungry,     
try to do this exercise.

We know from our experience     
that all these activities influence     
our health in longer terms and     
decides our mood in the present.    
    
It means the previous set of activities are     
deciding quality of life for the next moment    
    
Pay attention and without altering your actions     
follow your natural flow of actions     
make a note of total A, B, C and Ds     
Do this exercise for one week.     
Observe your data around A, B, C &amp; D.    
    
More A’s you have more free will     
you will experience with respect to taking food.     
More D’s you have more helplessness     
you will experience with respect to taking food    
    
You can apply this framework     
to any activity of your day to day life,     
like talking to someone,     
doing some work in the office,     
doing some physical health-related exercises,     
doing prayer/meditation,     
going to sleep at a particular time,     
waking up from sleep at a particular time.    
    
Without altering your actions     
If you observe your count and pattern of A, B, C, D     
for your various activities then     
you will come to know that     
how much you are in control of your life.     
And how much you can influence the surrounding     
And how much is completely out of your control?    
    
A wise is that who lives with the reality     
First, accept everything     
Then identify which you can change     
Get the courage and energy to change     
what you want to change     
Then change what you can change    
    
Finally, accept what cannot be changed     
Come to terms with those forces in life     
Which are out of your control    
    
And know from your experience that     
what I am today is not 100% choices of forces around me     
What I am is today is mostly made by my choices     
It is different that I failed to recognize those choices     
and exercise the free will     
at different moments of my life.    
    
The creator has designed     
this cosmos in such a way,     
That for a human, who has a possibility to live a conscious life     
There is the least helplessness.    
    
For other animals in this world     
who has the least self-awareness     
Most of life is a compulsive behavior    
    
For human most of life is     
a consequence of his or her choices     
and not the choice of someone     
who is sitting in Sky and counting     
how many breaths we have taken     
so that we can be called back.    
    
O Pratibimba, do I have free will is a wrong question!     
How much self-aware I am     
so that I can choose needs to inquired by each Jeeva.

# Article5039 : Boundaryless In Boundary    
tags: [ Mind, Philosophy]    
    
O wise one you know your limitations,     
You know your helplessness,     
You know your boundary,     
You know you have a desire     
To live in boundless space     
and in a timeless time     
A desire to expand your Relationship,     
business and influence Infinitely     
A desire to live and enjoy     
present and future without dropping     
your past good moments.    
    
Service to humanity, service to animals,     
Service to your religion, a life of morality     
All are your chosen way to live     
You chose those because of fear or     
out of compassion or that is the     
the only wise way to live?    
    
You say the human race is most wise     
Tell me which race other than human     
Seeks infinite thoughts the finite mean     
Want to enjoy eternally and infinitely!     
Even after knowing that     
there were time and space     
when and where you didn’t exist     
in that boundary, you live today!    
    
This boundary of your skin     
Is your created, nurtured, and maintained.     
What has been created and maintained     
Will be destroyed one day     
To understand this fact     
Do you need any help from books and other people?    
    
With time walls and boundaries     
become faint and weak     
No matter how much you maintain them     
Yoga and exercise is not to live long     
Because no one knows when you have     
to vacate house and boundary will fall     
Yoga and exercise is to live fully     
In the time, when you live in Boundary.    
    
If through some trick or grace     
Some wisdom dawn in your boundary     
of existence then that this is truly like this.     
This is me and this is not me.    
    
If you are able to clearly mark your boundary     
Of physical, mental, and emotional existence     
Then there is hope for you to     
Break the boundary at your own will.    
    
Once bounded know truly     
from the experience that I am boundless     
Then there is no cry and fear in you     
To live longer in a body,     
To work hard and earn most to maintain the boundary     
To be moral because of fear     
of law, society, god, or karma    
    
Because the way of wise is     
To live and let others live,     
Help bounded to break the boundary     
by bounded’s own efforts and wisdom     
No other human or god or messiah     
should remove my boundary without my wish    
    
The only lord of death has that right     
Only with time and suffering     
And association with mindful people     
can help me in knowing     
my true boundary and my boundlessness.

# Article5040 : Positive And Negative Professions    
tags: [ 'My Story', Philosophy]    
    
There is a city, every road in this city     
Has potholes and it is causing     
Lots of accidents, court case, and pain     
among civilians.    
    
And to fix this problem     
Intellectuals are debating     
that city needs to have     
more hospitals, more emergency wards,     
more doctors, more medicines     
more nurses, more advocate,     
more police force on the roads,     
more jails, more human right activist, etc.     
It means this entire economy is based on negative professions.    
    
Rather than fixing roads     
citizens are debating     
in favor of growing these professions,     
employment growth, increasing GDPS     
(gross domestic product and services)     
It means intellectuals of the city     
Wish to build and grow the economy     
of the city based on the miseries and pain     
of the city dwellers.    
    
If a village has more agricultural products,     
more opportunities to learn dance,     
sing, paint, draw, play, research,     
more beautiful living space for dwellers,     
more community activities,     
more opportunities to enjoy     
and celebrate festivals,     
more pot makers, jewelry designers.     
Equal opportunity for all,     
trust between dwellers,     
more schools and teachers to learn,     
no flexing muscle between people,     
love and respect for each other.     
Then this village is built on     
the happiness and joy of its dweller.    
    
If people learn to live sensibly     
in terms of eating, drinking,     
financial transactions and respect for others     
then why those professionals are required     
who are trying to fix the problems?    
    
If our focus is to fix the problem then     
we need professional of certain types.    
    
if our focus is to build a society     
In such a way that people live     
in a sensible way then more professionals     
of other types are required.    
    
Fortunately, the human mind is     
driven by greed, anger, lust, desire     
Therefore it is never possible     
for all human beings to live sensibly all the time.     
Hence all kinds of professionals are in demand.    
    
But we need to understand     
if there are more people     
with negative profession     
in the city or village     
Then this is one way of living.    
    
And if there are more people of     
the positive profession in the city or village     
then that is another way of living.    
    
Below is a list of professions     
whom you can present on a scale of     
negative to positive left to right.    
    
Most positive means they can exist independently,     
they should be more.     
Most negative means they should not be there,     
They are 100% dependent on other professions.    
    
Neutral means they in a happy society they should be minimum.     
They are a problem fixer.    
    
You can add more professions here     
and try decorating these on a colorful scale.     
You will have fun arranging them.    
    
Farmer, Cook, Artist, Musicians, Scientist,     
Technologists, Trader, Accountant, Automation Expert,     
Goldsmith, Blacksmith, Teacher, Thinker, Writer,     
Dancer, Engineer, Comedian,     
Doctors, Lawyers, Police, Warrior     
Salesman, Marketer, HR Professional     
NewsMaker, Politicians, Brokers     
Thief, Robber, Terrorist, Smugglers, prostitute,     
poison maker, drug manufacturer,     
financial insurer, money lander,     
fire extinguisher and add more.    
    
O Chaitanya, if a human with the given     
superior cerebral system     
doesn’t behave like an animal     
they live healthy and ready to leave the body     
when time is over     
then what are those professions     
without which human can live happily?

# Article5041 : Journey Of The Siddhartha    
tags: [ 'Indian Culture', Mindfulness, Philosophy]    
    
The world around us has mysterious ways,     
to teach some deeper lessons of life.     
In ancient time there was a Siddhartha     
He was a prince and had all luxuries     
At his disposal to enjoy the life     
But, he saw suffering and Dukkha     
In a certain way of living     
and started a journey     
to free from the clutches of Dukkha.     
And he became The Siddhartha, The Buddha.    
    
Then a came time when     
Mother started naming their children     
Siddhartha, Buddha, Tathagat     
They thought their child will live     
like a feather, untouched from the gravity     
of the suffering from the world around.    
    
All kind of education and training was     
Given to children so that they can live     
A wiser life than their older generation lived     
But, where is The Buddha in us?    
    
Society has seen many great people in the last 2500 years     
but a name who had everything of the world     
and chose to live life with nothing is nowhere.     
Was Siddhartha a fool to choose that way of life?    
    
New age Siddhartha choosing the reverse way of living     
From beggar to the king, nothing to everything     
Unknown name to omnipresent name     
After earning all this,     
One day, disappear all of sudden.    
    
O Pratibimba! I want to know     
What is wrong with the new age Siddhartha?     
Is success that bad?     
Is money so bad?     
Is working hard for making life better bad?     
Is working for passion is bad?     
Is greed bad?     
Is a desire to be the best, the first in the world bad?     
Older Siddhartha has taught us Nirvaan marga     
New Siddhartha is teaching us what?    
    
Pratibimba is sad and silent today     
Not spoken any word to me     
But, I am realizing nothing of the above is bad     
After all, in this world, there are many kinds of people     
who live and finally leave one day     
Some ceremoniously some unceremoniously     
How will a person depart,     
this is in the hand of the unknown.    
    
But try to live in a sensible way     
A way of Middle Path, Madhya Maarga     
Which come from the teaching of Older Siddhartha     
But new Siddhartha chose to ignore     
Being in business, profession, family     
We need to understand the messages     
From both the Siddharthas.    
    
What is the message of Siddhartha VG left for us?    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat

## Assets of Divinely Person    
    
Many people get confused about what is good and whatnot,     
what is right and whatnot.     
Obviously, it is the context that makes things     
good or bad, right or wrong     
but there is small help from the Guru of Bhagwat Gita     
for those who are looking for commandments.    
    
Unfortunately, many people around us do not know Samskrut     
and in local Indian languages, these Samskrut words have various meanings.     
Although the commentary of many Acharya’s     
has been translated into English     
but those are so big to read     
that people think we will read and understand that after retirement.     
Other times commentary from different     
Bhakti, Vishista Advaita Vedanta, Advaita Vedanta     
Schools have multiple interpretations.    
    
The text below is translated based on my understanding     
of Samskrut and understanding various translations of Bhagawat Gita.    
    
Here are 26 Assets of Divine Person. Words in () is Samskruit word from the original text.

# Article5043 : How To Acquire New Skills    
tags: [ 'My Views', Science]    
    
## About Science and Art of Learning    
    
Science means rules, formula, process,     
Repeatability, reproducibility, scalability    
    
Art means uniqueness, unrepeatability, creativity,     
an unknown formula, an unknown process of production,     
extremely difficult to reproduced and scale.    
    
A computer program is an art for a musician     
A piece of unique music is art for a computer programmer.    
    
Something which is extremely difficult for one     
to produce is fun for others. How and why?     
Because that person has learned     
the science behind the subject.    
    
If you learn the basic rule and formula of drawing fine arts     
or music then it is less art and more science for you.     
It is fun and while dancing on the board     
you can draw the best picture    
    
If musician learn how to think the way     
computer processes code     
then it is science for him to write code.     
While talking to his friend     
he can develop a new algorithm.    
    
Where do we learn science?     
Initially our parents, teachers, mentors,     
experienced professionals teach this to us.     
They also teach us how to pay attention     
to the surrounding so that we can learn the rule on our own.    
    
All training institutes, schools, colleges, universities     
helps us downloading that science to us     
which either they have developed,     
or received from the previous generations     
or peers around them.    
    
To learn the art of a profession     
there are few places     
but to learn the science of a profession     
there are many places.    
    
After we have learned     
the old science of the profession in the classroom,     
There is a life before us to discover new science     
from the art (complexities) of our profession.    
    
Initially even riding a bicycle is art.     
After learning the rules, it becomes science.     
It looks anybody can do it.    
    
So in every science, there is an art for us,     
which we are not able to comprehend    
    
And in every art, there is some science for us     
which we can easily teach to others     
Repeat and produce exactly the same outcome as before.    
    
But learning does not end,     
when we have understood all the rules of the profession     
Learning takes new heights     
then we start observing new patterns on our own    
    
Sometimes we see such patterns     
which nobody observed before     
This is called removing the cover lying on some art     
Once we remove the cover it is a discovery     
And now it is no more art for you     
Now, it becomes science.    
    
What is science today,     
Was miracle for most of the human sometimes back.     
But it never happens that today’s science     
will become the art of tomorrow.    
    
Once we know how it works then     
There is no magic, no hidden rule     
Any person willing to put efforts to follow the steps     
will be able to reproduce     
that which is expected by the process.    
    
Therefore, when in class we pay most attention     
To learn the rules of the profession     
Whether art or engineering or medical     
or music or programming     
Whether a teacher is boring or interesting     
Keep your subject live in your mind.    
    
Apply your common sense     
And observations to assimilate     
what is being explained     
Then experiment with that rule to experience the outcome.    
    
When you are done then you have     
assimilated the basic rules of the profession    
    
Sometimes if you sit near a giant master     
Of the profession, you will learn     
Such rules which only he knows     
Because he observed it by doing     
It is not written anywhere    
    
If you learn those rules then     
your life becomes easy     
because you need not discover that jewel again.    
    
Unfortunately many of the people     
In the profession don’t pay much attention and time to learn the rules     
They want to finish the work in hand by hook or crook     
Make money, get awards and recognition     
But not ready to learn the basic rules or processes.    
    
If we don’t know even basic rule then     
where is the scope of observing patterns of a new problem?     
In this situation forget about     
scope of developing your own rules,     
Those rules, which you can share with     
your colleagues and family members    
    
Just copy-pasting text     
from one window to another window, doesn’t help.     
Storing file on the hard disk or on bookshelves doesn’t help     
Things will always remain mysterious for you.    
    
Just because you have seen some video     
or read text doesn’t give you the confidence     
that you have learned the rule.    
    
There are many high tech gadgets around us or in our hand     
And we don’t know how it works!     
Neither people are interested in learning     
Nor it is possible for all to learn all.    
    
But there must be one field in our life     
For which you know most of the rule     
It has become a science for us     
And, we still enjoy that profession     
Because we still see some patterns there     
which we didn’t know before    
    
Many experts in our field don’t know about those     
But we can do that like an artist     
Sometimes an artist puts a stroke on the canvas     
and a beautiful piece comes up.     
Not because he wanted to make good art,     
But because he has perfected the science so much that     
He cannot make a mistake     
And someday, If he deviates from the science     
then the product is a fantastic art    
    
When you are engaged with nature in such a way     
then Life is fun, more joyful and playful    
    
Life becomes boring and tiresome when     
It rolls from month to month.     
From one customer to another customer,     
From one delivery to another delivery,     
From one paycheck to the next paycheck.     
From one promotion to another.     
From one birthday to the next birthday.     
From one Friday to next Friday party.     
This way we look excuse to celebrate     
the moments of life.    
    
But when you are committed to the process     
where converting art to science is a game of every moment     
then every moment is a thrill.     
Every moment is a festival and joy.

# Article5044 : No Universal Teachings    
tags: [ Philosophy]    
    
To live a meaningful and joyful life     
Context is the key for wise one,    
    
The environment around us is comprised of     
People, government, society, traditions,     
weather, and the faith of different people     
This all have some kind of temperament,     
style attitude and behavior.     
All these do not have one unambiguous     
nonoverlapping Language.    
    
They all express their deeper experiences,     
pride, supremacy, superiority     
and the desire to dominate or survive.     
This expression takes shape in the form     
of their words and their actions    
    
It is rare to find a person who is     
Rich in experience, good in intention,     
mine of words and fearless in expressing.     
But in every age, there are a few people     
Who are rich in all these qualities     
And they choose to express     
the truth experienced in the words.     
People around them document their words     
And then spread the teachings     
of those master or wise people    
    
Named are given to those     
poetical or prosaic texts like     
Vachana, Vaani, Geeta, Bible, Quran, Dohe, Sloka     
Their follower think it is the ultimate teaching     
of their Guru, messenger, and prophet     
For them, that is the final word from heaven.     
For all the time of past, present, and future     
For all the lives of all spaces either earth or water or sky    
    
We always live in a world     
where everything is experienced     
in relativity or relationship of other objects around.    
    
Can you know tall, big, good, sacred, light,     
holy without second around?     
Any time a second is required to compare.    
    
Experiencer’s values, traditions, methods,     
culture, food is always better for him     
This is the way of wise.    
    
The moment a person thinks     
It is irrelevant, illogical he will drop that.    
    
Families, Societies, cultures     
and states take a longer time to drop those.    
    
But any sensible group of people     
will not hold to wrong or irrelevant for longer and follow that.    
    
Followers think their book contains     
The ultimate teaching     
of their master or God so they continue.    
    
In this relative existence     
no one can have experience     
of the absolute, ultimate and non-dual     
The degree of experience duality     
or absoluteness can vary but all know     
I am here and the world is there.    
    
Do you know any person     
in past or present who     
Knew the surrounding     
in this non dual absolute way     
and could live always in that experience.    
    
Who knew himself like no boundary around!     
Who knew he is here and everywhere!     
Who knew that he don’t exist     
And only environment exists!     
Who knew that only he exists     
and there is no second!    
    
In this relative world of existence     
Wise people are not bothered     
much about the future than the present     
So they tell based on     
the moment of living,     
based on the time and space in which they live.     
They always solve the problem of the present.    
    
This is the reason     
when we refer the text after their departure     
We find contraction between     
The texts of different wise people     
And the different interpretation of the same textbook     
by the different Guru.    
    
The biggest message can be     
Live a sensible life     
Understand the context     
Avoid generalizing knowledge     
Avoid putting labels and concluding.    
    
Because till there is last life in the cosmos     
There are infinite possibilities for that life     
What that life can become no one can tell     
What that life should do no one can force     
After all who knows human intentions?    
    
People based on their conviction     
Takes excerpts of the text     
From different people and books     
Weave a story and try to tell us     
their personal truth as     
the absolute and ultimate Truth and Teaching.    
    
Therefore no matter what book you refer     
Always look at the current context     
And the situation in which something is said     
By the Gurus in past.    
    
Never do blind copying and pasting of the text     
of experts and realized ones     
Unless it is a law of nature.

With time we explore the world outside     
With time we dive into the world inside     
Outside means which is available to all     
All who have senses of seeing, hearing, etc.     
Can explore the outside.    
    
Inside means which is not available to our senses     
For example food, you can search outside but hunger is inside     
The beauty you see outside but lust is inside     
Music is outside but the ability to enjoy is inside     
Money is outside but the ability to give     
the direction and purpose of the money is inside    
    
Relationships are physical and hence bondage outside     
but the sense of freedom is inside     
Your favorite dish is on the table but the enjoyment is inside     
A cut is on the skin, outside, but the pain is inside     
Abusive words are outside but anger is inside     
Every sensitive mind can explore inside.    
    
When you live on the land which has sun all the time of the year,     
six seasons, flora and fauna,     
hundreds of rivers and fountain around     
Then your outside need is taken care of by the nature.     
With little effort, you will be able to fill your stomach.    
    
Other things like house or cloth     
the more you work the more you accumulate.     
There is a start but no end to this.    
    
There have been people in all the time     
who observed the human life cycle carefully     
and asked this question, What next?     
Now what to do in the remaining time.    
    
In this spirit, they landed into exploring inside     
And it became so interesting for them that     
they knew whatever is inside     
is exactly outside in the universe    
    
So, some thought why to search outside, endlessly     
If we put our life in understanding inside then     
In lesser time we can understand     
everything inside and outside both.    
    
That land is called Bharat, India.     
If you keep aside suffering, invasion,     
suppression, conversion     
of one thousand years aside     
and including today’s time     
Then you will find Indians are highly spiritual in nature     
Because external is taken care of by nature     
so they didn’t rush much for outer accumulation     
Competition, show-off,     
Neither Indian valued those much.    
    
On this land a person who leaves everything,     
One’s family, property, friends, life mission     
And perform his final rite,     
the rite of cremation with his own hands.     
And after this, he walks on the earth     
Knowing that he doesn’t exist     
What is walking now is a body     
which is given by the Grace of Guru     
It has come out from that funeral pyre     
And now he doesn’t have     
his own desire and determination    
    
He doesn’t cook for himself     
He doesn’t build anything for himself     
He doesn’t earn money     
He lives with a begging bowl     
He lives with his Guru given body     
He lives for self-realization, teaching     
and strengthening society,     
through his presence he reminds society     
About selflessness.     
Then he is called Swami (Lord).    
    
Those who remain hooked to the     
Families, properties, friends, and relatives     
They are called “Samsari” (worldly),     
“Daasa” (slave) of the objects.     
So Daasa who has everything     
Go to a Swami who has nothing     
To get something or everything whatever he need.     
What a beautiful concept is this!    
    
In today’s time because of     
western influences and missionary work     
All this looks confusing to the people in our society.    
    
In the last thousand years to survive     
We have developed and copied different     
methods for our cultural existence.     
And in this process, lots of change happened     
to our original thought process as well.    
    
Indians are not foolish to reject the material world     
It was so much available to them     
That they never gave importance     
to something which was in abundance or always available.    
    
Now people have much more     
to live a comfortable life than our ancestors had     
Now even western people have enough     
which their ancestors never had     
So when comforts are taken care of, outside is taken care     
Then why run so much in the outside direction?    
    
Ancient people were much wiser     
They chose to spend time     
In research, discovery, and contemplation    
    
Nowadays when we don’t have enough problems     
Then we invent a problem for others or for ourselves     
And spend time solving those problems!    
    
We are losing those genes     
given to us by our ancestors.     
A curious mind, original thinker, deep thinker     
contemplative, meditative, always seeking mind     
are originated from that gene.    
    
Very soon a day may come     
when with abundant resources around     
we will become so much materialistic     
that we don’t know how to live joyfully and peacefully.    
    
We are going in the direction     
where we can remain restless and peace-less     
with all the wealth, comforts, and technologies around.    
    
When you have enough time     
Then seek that which you don’t know     
Or solve that puzzle that is mysterious for you.     
Rather than multiplying your comforts and     
increasing your security and insurance!    
    
O Pratibimba, do you think     
That I do not know all this?     
I know this but where is the time?     
The time to seek, ask, contemplate.     
I am busy in gossips, TV, news, politics,     
laughter shows because that gives me     
a temporary rest from a hectic day

# Article5046 : My Significance

One day, I came out of my apartment     
Went one a long travel to the mountains     
Here I am standing at the feet of a mountain     
There is a peak where I wish to go.    
    
With my efforts, I could reach     
on the mountain top after six hours     
But after reaching there I found     
Many larger mountains than on which I was standing.    
    
All these tall looking mountains standing on earth     
But, If one could put all these mountains in an ocean     
Then they all will disappear, this is their smallness.     
And, all the ocean resting on the earth    
    
This earth is rotating around the sun     
Sun rotating around the galaxies.     
Stars, Planets, Galaxies are eaten by black-hole     
And many black-holes exist in space.    
    
If this whole space is like a     
one million years old banyan tree     
who had many leaves, branches, and fruits in the past     
today it has the same number of leaves, branches &amp; fruits.     
But, are these same leaves, branches &amp; fruits for million years?    
    
On this huge banyan tree     
there are millions of fruits hanging today     
My significance is not more than     
a seed inside the fruit of this tree.     
In the size that is how big I am.    
    
Is there any specific seed, fruit, leaf, or branch     
more important in this million years old tree?    
    
If a particular seed wants to pray to this tree does it help the tree?     
Can a particular seed revolt against the tree?     
If a seed revolt then how does it impact the tree?    
    
If a specific seed decides to     
live long face life while living on the tree?     
Does the tree get impacted?    
    
What if a specific seed decide to live     
a joyful life on the tree?     
Does the tree become happy?    
    
What if a specific seed thinks     
I am very special on this tree?     
I should get special treatment     
And special treatment from all other     
seeds, fruits, leaves, and branches of this tree.     
Whom does this seed making fool?    
    
In a life of millions of years the tree     
has seen many seeds like me     
who are happy or unhappy.    
    
They come and go but the tree remains     
What a fuss is this that I am a special seed     
need special treatment on this tree     
otherwise, I will destroy others     
around me and this tree as well.    
    
The tree has seen, many fools like me     
who come out from it     
remain there for a couple of years     
rest on a some remote far branch     
and finally, go the ground     
and become manure for the tree    
    
Perhaps for the tree, they are more useful     
when they become manure for the tree.    
    
O Pratibimba, how can an insignificant seed     
become significant while living inside the fruit on the tree?    
    
O Hari, seed need to go in the ground     
finish himself and become another tree     
That is the only way.     
But then seed does not know     
I am a seed or branch or fruit     
It knows I am a million old tree.    
    
So an insignificant becomes most significant     
when it is finished and loses its identity with smallness or bigness     
A seed becomes significant when     
it knows there is no second to compete.     
I am the one and basis of all.    
    
O Pratibimba, perhaps I got it.     
I am a small seed on this tree     
If I keep aside this physical body     
and live like an eternal being     
Then am I that million old tree?

# Article5047 : Life In Awareness    
tags: [ Mindfulness, Philosophy]    
    
When you are in a deep sleep     
There is no dream, no awareness     
of the inside, the mind, and body     
And no awareness of the outside world,     
the clothes you are wearing,     
the bed and place of your sleeping,     
the time of your sleep,     
persons, relatives friends, foes around you.    
    
At that time there is no experience of time and space     
No influence of forces of time and space upon you     
No misery, no pain, no gain, no loss,     
No love, no hate, no enemy, no friend     
Nothing is yours, nothing of others     
Non-duality in unawareness!    
    
But that time all these really cease to exist?     
No! they all exist but you are not aware.     
Do they exist the same way,     
the way they exist when you are awake?    
    
No! because your awareness     
influences everything around you.     
No! because you also create     
a lot many things in your mind.    
    
Consciousness is all-pervading in the space     
And beyond space     
In all the inert and live.    
    
Consciousness is spanning in all the time of     
past, present, and future     
And when there is no time    
    
For our senses, there is no place where is no space.     
But for our mind, there is an experience of no space.    
    
For our mind, there is no time when time is no more.     
But in our life, there is an experience of no time.    
    
How come we experience something     
Which doesn’t exist like no time and no space?    
    
Consciousness is not like air,     
because it also exists where no air     
not like darkness, because it also exists in no darkness     
not like light, because it also exists in no light     
not like goodness, because it also exists in no goodness    
    
Awareness is local and limited to the boundary     
When physically boundary is human     
then it is called is a human life     
When animal then it is an animal life     
When society then it is a social life     
When religion then it is a religious life     
When culture then it is a cultural life     
When nation then it is a life of a nation.    
    
Without awareness     
An animal is no animal.     
Human is no human.     
Society is no society     
Culture is no culture     
Religion is no religion     
A nation is no nation    
    
It looks like human or animal lives     
are the lowest form of self-aware entities     
And society, religion, culture, nation     
is the collective awareness of the living people, animals, etc     
All these are part of bigger systems.    
    
But think if your hand, stomach, legs, lungs,     
and heart are self-aware or not?     
If they are not self-aware then who makes them work?     
Don’t fool yourself by saying the wish of god!     
By that logic even society, nation everything is run by god!    
    
So, if all parts of my body are aware     
Then what is that smallest entity which is self-aware?     
Body cells? Molecules? Atom? Subatomic particles?    
    
Awareness in the gross body is percolated upside     
From the subsystems of which a body is made     
But consciousness is not like that.    
    
So what happens at sleep when you lose awareness?     
Do you have consciousness in the body?     
Of course, consciousness is full-on in all space and time.     
But awareness is dimmed     
Individual body parts are aware and they work     
because they have consciousness     
and dimmed self-awareness.    
    
But in the deep sleep state, the body as a whole     
even with the omnipresent consciousness     
doesn’t have awareness of the self.    
    
Awareness gets dimmed when you over eat     
You are drunk, lost in anger, lost in lust, and sleep.    
    
Awareness is the basis of life     
Your body parts may have     
consciousness and self-awareness so they may survive     
but if you lose awareness of your body parts     
then very soon you die even with self-aware body parts    
    
With awareness, we can make dying parts, live again     
Without awareness, we can make     
our perfect working system dead in a course of time    
    
Whether it is the body of an individual,     
or family, or culture or nation     
It is the awareness of those lives     
who are part of the system,     
that makes the system live.    
    
Physical Body or society or nation     
of unaware person, citizens are consumed by maggots.    
    
Chemical substances, drugs, selfishness     
are poisons of the system they reduce the awareness    
    
If you are in favor of life for your body,     
culture and nation then chose awareness    
    
But for that remain at a distance     
as much possible from toxins,     
mind-numbing substances, selfishness.    
    
Life is definitely not about forgetting past bad events     
for which we need to consume something to forget.    
    
Life is definitely not about mindlessly enjoying     
getting engrossed and losing control over the body     
for which we consume something.    
    
Life is about living in awareness,     
For that, we need to learn to handle our own mind     
And it is not by trying to forget something.     
or pretending to forget something.    
    
O Pratibimba, In the absence of awareness     
There may be consciousness but no life.

# Article5048 : About Physicality And Relationship    
tags: [ Philosophy]    
    
What is that in this world with which I don’t have a relationship?     
Name of the relationships may be different     
The degree of love and care may vary     
How seriously I take them may vary     
How much I can work for them may vary     
But I have a relationship with everything around me!    
    
Hate and love are two extreme emotions     
But the name of the scale is love     
On the scale of love when the value is zero,     
we called it indifference to the object or the person     
When the value is negative we call that hate     
When the value is positive we call it love     
But in all the cases this is the scale of love     
which vary from negative to positive.    
    
Emotions are the basis of relationships     
Being indifferent to someone or something is an emotion     
Being hateful to someone or something is another emotion     
Being loving to someone or something is another expression.    
    
Mine-ness is the basis of a relationship     
What is that to which I cannot put mine?    
    
I have relationships with my body as a whole     
And my body parts. They are mine     
I have relationships with the house and car. they are mine.     
I have relationships with a bed, books, and food on the table, they are mine     
I have relationships with the religion, state, language, and nation, they are mine.     
I have relationships with land, culture, and people, they are mine.     
I have relationships with business, employees, bosses, they are mine.     
I have relationships with my parents, brother, sister,     
children, spouse, and friends they are mine    
    
I have relationships with air, but I don’t care.     
I have relationships with the sun, moon, and earth, but I don’t care.     
I have relationships with birds flying in the sky, but I don’t care.     
I have relationships with trees, flowers,     
and fruits in the forest around me, but I don’t care.     
I have relationships with people who are traveling with me,     
who are selling to me or buy from me, but I am cautious.    
    
I have a relationship with, who abused me, I want to teach him.     
I have a relationship with, who has stolen my goods, I want to send them jail.     
I have a relationship with, who beat me, I wanted to beat him more.     
I have relationships with a neighboring hostile country,     
I want to ensure my army beat them.    
    
Physicality in life is the basis of all the relationship     
Relative and Relationship means connectivity.     
With this physical existence of mine     
Is there anything in the existence     
to which we are not connected     
or who is not my relative?    
    
How we label a relationship that decides     
Kind of Emotions in the relationship.     
How much we interact and transact in a relationships     
that decides the degree of strength of the relationship.     
Both feelings are not good for positive strong relations.    
    
So, when one says I am not related to that,     
It means, he is saying I don’t have any emotions for him     
Or I have negative emotions for that     
Or the degree of positive emotions is very weak     
Or the degree of negative emotions is very high.    
    
Does the name of the relationship rest in the air?     
No, but in mind.     
Does the kind of emotions rest in the air?     
No, but in mind.     
Does the degree and strength of emotion rest in the air?     
No, in mind.    
    
If all exists in my mind then who decides,     
What should I store in my mind for a particular relation?    
    
I heard you are saying objects around me     
to whom I am related, they decide.     
The way they behave, I store the relationship in my mind.    
    
If that is the case then you will have     
all the selfish people around you.     
Without any purpose why somebody wants     
a particular quality and strength of relationships with you?    
    
If you say, we both decide     
then it is a transactional relationship     
and any point time one feel without saying that     
I give more compare to others in this relation     
or others give more I am helpless to pay back.    
    
If you say, I decide then this looks the way of wise.     
What I want to feel in my mind and how much,     
It is one hundred percent, my business.     
Irrespective of what others do.    
    
This is the way of living     
in which you are not tortured and grilled     
by the positive or negative actions of people around.    
    
We know all the people, objects, entities, and lives around us,     
behave the way they feel.     
Then why should I make my mind     
negative for their feelings or actions.    
    
Love is the basis of everything     
Even if I don’t like someone     
the best way to handle is love.    
    
So when it is said that with love     
you can win the war, it doesn’t mean     
that always hug and kiss to win the war.    
    
It also means without being negative     
you can demolish your enemy.    
    
In the Mahabharat war, there is mention of King Salya     
Who had unbeaten coolness and     
he was fighting on behalf of Duryodhana.     
With that kind of coolness, nobody could beat him     
But he was the enemy of Pandavas     
So, Krishna decided a match of Salya     
Krishna sends Yudhister to fight with Salya     
Yudhister was the height of coolness     
Finally in the fight, without anger     
Yudhister demolishes Salya.    
    
We all have a physical existence     
Physicality is the basis of all the relationship     
Everything is connected and related to us     
With the different name of the relation     
With different kinds and degrees of relation.    
    
For a sensible living     
Do not allow your fertile mind     
to sprout any kind of negative relationship.     
Even if you want to convey some message     
to someone with whom you do not agree with     
There is always a positive name for the relation.

# Article5049 : Role Of Leftists In The Indian Society    
tags: [ 'My Views']    
    
Unit of an idea is a thought     
A thought of love, respect, value, care, preservation, etc.     
Let’s call this X thought.     
Or thought of disrespect, discouragement, carelessness, demolition, etc.     
Let’s call this Y thought.    
    
Based on our understanding of life,     
the environment around and our value system,     
We may choose to apply X thought     
or Y thought on the concepts of     
nation, a particular religion, caste of people, color of people,     
geography of people, nationality of people,     
praying method of people, and the belief system of the people.    
    
With that thought process, we level     
the people, religion, culture, and societies around.     
If we are powerful and dictator then     
we can enforce and spread our idea to the masses     
And force them to follow our idea     
or tell them to be ready to lose their life.    
    
If we are democratic then we use another method     
to enforce and spread our idea to the masses.     
If certain people don’t follow my ideas then     
We outcast them or keep trying with them     
till the time we are living or other is alive.    
    
Human society will always have different kinds of mind     
Sometimes these minds are so much radical to each other     
That, it looks one will survive only if the second die.     
For that, they use their God-given purpose     
as proof of their righteousness and finish others.    
    
Nothing wrong with having different ideas     
Or sometimes extremely opposite ideas     
Nothing wrong in crying to protect our ideas     
Nothing wrong with working hard     
and trying to convince others that my idea is the best idea.    
    
But try all with some logic, some common sense, some humanity.     
Show others the benefits of your ideas.     
Do not threaten people.     
Do not use your power of any kind     
to suppress permanently to an individual or a society.    
    
If thought can be measured on an infinite scale from left to right     
On the left side, we can keep Y thoughts     
and on the right side, we can put X thoughts.     
Start applying these X &amp; Y thoughts     
to the concept of nation, religion or a certain religion,     
or certain cast, geography or certain geography of people, etc    
    
Once you are done then     
locate the center on this scale     
Do this with your own perspective     
And then with someone’s perspective, who you don’t like     
You will find there is no center.     
There are hater and lovers of every idea.    
    
Leftists are an integral part of liberal societies     
You will find them in all the democratic nations     
Democratic planes are the only land where this crop can grow.    
    
But if you compare the leftists of different nations     
you will find some similarities.     
They are liberal, anti-religion, humanist, modernist, etc.    
    
Interestingly, if you analyze the leftist of Bharat     
they have a unique quality,     
Which none of other country’s leftist have     
Leftist in the Bharat is against the idea of a nation,     
patriotism, grand narrative of Bharat and anti majority.    
    
So on a thought quality scale, you will find     
Leftist of the world are centrist and     
Rightists of the world are on the extreme right.     
Therefore to bring balance in a society Leftists are required.    
    
But, the leftists of India are extreme left or extreme right.     
Rightists of India are centrist.     
Do you think this is by chance?    
    
No! It is characteristic of Hindu Dharma     
Listen to all ideas, concepts, philosophies,     
question, discuss, debate with others,     
Convince them or get convinced.    
    
Then with new ideas and concepts     
realign the center again     
And keep moving     
Never become rigid     
So, in Indian society, what looks left or right     
at some points in time     
Hindu dharma traditions make sure to align themself     
And masses of the Bharat lives in the center.    
    
So the role which leftist play in other parts of the world     
is not available in the land of Bharat     
Because Acharyas, Gurus, Renounced Individuals (sadhus) play that role.    
    
But, if Gurus or Acharya, Sadhus of the Bhartiya society     
compromise on their role then leftists try to take that space     
That is one of the reasons why leftists are against     
our Gurus, Acharyas, Sadhus because in their presence     
Leftists are not having the role of bringing rights to the center.

# Article5050 : Driven By Humanity Or Morality    
tags: [ 'Ethics & Morality', Philosophy]    
    
Fear, pain, reward, and punishment,     
either from government or authorities or God or Karma     
Is always the driving force for a human to be righteous.    
    
It is not out of the Duty or Dharma     
of the given time and space     
But something different     
which brings humans to their senses.    
    
There are enough people around us     
who either don’t understand     
these driving forces correctly     
or do not take even these     
rudimentary motivations seriously,     
So they chose to ignore.    
    
There are enough people around us who are     
Broken heart, ignored, bitter and remorse,     
because of their own karma,     
which came back to them in their lifetime.     
So it becomes a reminder for others to live sensibly.    
    
There are enough people around us     
Who has wronged everything and maximum around     
But even after that, they are living     
without any visible pain in their life.     
And, it becomes another kind of reminder for people around.    
    
After seeing the examples of     
arrogance getting beaten badly     
and sometimes nothing happens.     
People around think and choose what to do!     
What they chose, depends upon their conviction.     
Sensible people chose the path of goodness.    
    
But, their goodness is driven out of the fear     
And not because they think that     
this is the most sensible way of living     
no matter what other people say or do around     
or what happens to other people around.    
    
Now take the below instances one at a time     
And think why do we behave the way we do.    
    
Who taught us Good or Bad?     
What is the motivation?     
Is motivation a fear, pain,     
or human sensitivity and sensibility?    
    
How to behave with elders and younger?     
How to treat mother, father, and teacher?     
What is the importance of giving timely help to some needy?    
    
Why to help a friend?     
Why donate for a cause?     
Why respect the resources we have?     
Why respect food?     
Why take care of our health when the body is fit?    
    
Why fight for our values?     
Why fight for our nation?     
Why pay taxes to the government?     
Why learn seriously in school?    
    
Why not leave older people at old age home?     
Why not beat or exploit the weak?     
Why not kill others?     
Why not flutter with friends’ spouses?    
    
Why not beat children?     
Why not steal goods?     
Why not waste money on luxury?    
    
Do you think, if fear of karma,     
God, unknown, Saitan, next life pain,     
suffering in the future are taken care     
then human will behave like a saint?    
    
Fortunately, the human cerebral cortex is     
such complex and highly developed     
compare to other animals that     
if a human explores he can be divine.    
    
But unfortunately, people don’t have time     
To think beyond enjoyment, business, religion,     
commandments, ethics, and morality     
Most of the people are stuck in either of these one     
So they live like a higher version of creatures    
    
No sense of Swa-Dharma,     
which every sensible person will always feel,     
irrespective of time and space.     
But, all the time body, recognition, money,     
the reputation of the self is the highest priority.    
    
So we take care of parents or     
do any of the above discussed good actions     
Because our children, next generation     
can repeat our actions for us     
Or God will punish us     
Or what other people will think about us.    
    
It is not about that,     
this is the only way of life     
Irrespective of who says or     
does what, now or in the future.    
    
That is why ancient people created those     
Fearful stories of hell     
and luxurious of heaven.    
    
Nowadays fortunately or unfortunately     
Those hell and heavens are falling     
So, God is taken care of.    
    
People started believing     
“Jindagi Naa Milegi Dobara”     
this is the only and last life.     
Rich people are learning     
how to manage government and courts     
Now, who will bring humans to their senses?    
    
O Pratibimba, Unfortunately, but true     
Why human is driven by Morality, not by Humanity?     
How can a bold and fearless human live without Humanity     
and take shelter under a tiny branch of Morality?

We know for sure that birds, insects, reptiles & animals     
are the citizen of this planet.     
But, we do not know for sure that     
Human on this earth     
Came from another planet     
Or the evolution of animal on this planet     
Or God created humanity in his mind     
Every religion has its own cosmology.     
Biologists and theoretical physicists still debating the point.    
    
About human, one thing we know for sure     
That on this planet human came first     
Languages came and improved later     
Scripting of language came next     
And books came last    
    
From whatever process, the human came on this planet     
He first struggles to survive for a day     
Then for a longer and longer time.    
    
To ensure his own survival he produced children,     
communities, sciences for fighting     
and winning against nature and the animals around     
Finally, fight and win other communities around.    
    
The initial struggle was to arrange the external setup     
So that the external environment can be stabilized.     
To do that mass education was required     
The purpose was not to empower others     
The purpose was to make them understand     
what powerful muscular one wants.    
    
Immoral people cannot be dominated!     
For that purpose moral principles developed     
So that there is harmony within the society and ruling is easy.     
But at the time same those moral principles     
allowed to loot and murder other societies.     
And we regard human morality as God!    
    
Initially, the problem of the ruling was not that big     
Because initial desire was the desire to be stronger     
Then the desire to rule entered the human mind    
    
Over the period of time     
People started thinking about what is the purpose of life     
What is that which I should do     
for which people around me bow down before me.     
People worship me even when I am not around.    
    
Then some decided the purpose is to become     
the best in my community     
And all across the known world     
They worked hard to realized their purpose in life.    
    
Some came with the crazy ideas     
about the purpose of life     
which people around them couldn’t accept easily    
    
So the smarter one came with the ideas     
and said you have to listen to me     
Because God has sent me here    
    
To protect you, guide you, and teach you.    
    
God has given me some message for you     
You make the book of this message     
Read this message carefully     
Read 3 times or 5 times every day     
Don’t question The Book     
and Read with utmost faith.    
    
If you don’t understand     
then question your own intelligence and intellect     
Question your experience, senses, and common sense     
Question your limitations to reason but     
Never question this book     
This is a God-given book.     
Finally, if you don’t understand then     
ask me or my appointed people around.    
    
And, one more thing     
if you doubt this book     
then there is a hell, you will go there for eternal time     
But, if you believe in all of this book     
And do whatever is said then you will go to heaven.    
    
If people around you don’t understand     
and don’t follow the book     
Then do them a favor     
Kill them and send them to God     
All merciful god will give them love     
And when you go to God you will get special treatment.    
    
People in the olden time must be pained     
with their existing struggle too much     
Who wants to go to that hell     
which this so-called messenger of God is painting.    
    
On top of that world around     
must be full of struggle     
so even if there is a hope of getting a better place     
to live even after dying     
which this messenger is claiming,     
an eternal life with God and temporary pain on this planet     
Then let’s follow this wise and smarter person.     
Thus they followed the book.    
    
The initial purpose of creating religion was not that bad.     
It was a mass healing tool     
It was a tool to discipline people     
A tool to create a stable society     
A tool to create a knowledge base     
and transfer the knowledge to other people around     
and to the next generation.    
    
Without religion, it was not possible at all     
to come this far in human civilization as we have come today.    
    
Initially, Religion and power were integrated     
Slowly more independent thinker started coming     
challenging the book and the ruler     
These people were suppressed and out-casted     
When these independent thinkers made more sense to the masses     
then they have their own followers.    
    
When the new thinker dies     
his thinking and teaching becomes another book     
And his followers became religious.    
    
This business of reading, writing, and     
teaching is going on for many centuries.    
    
Those who cannot read     
someone else will read on their behalf     
Those who cannot write     
someone else write on their behalf.    
    
But, what happens if someone is not able to understand.     
Or understand something which is against     
the ruler and leader of the religion.     
In that case, a so-called learned will translate     
and make sure people understand     
what religious leader and ruler wants to say     
not what is written or what is good for the masses.    
    
Over a period of time so many other subjects     
has evolved for reading, writing, and teaching purpose     
A huge knowledge base is created around the new subjects.    
    
But old books remain always popular     
Not because they have teachings for human     
about how to live sensibly with other people around     
But because those are the tools of mass psychology,     
a tool to control and rule.    
    
Who, in power or religion,     
bothers truly about the life of the citizens?     
Everybody is interested either in their ruling or surviving.    
    
People go for the mass reading of their books     
They come and sit at one place     
Sometimes reading books in public places     
Sometimes reading with high volume speakers     
Not to prove that they are educated     
But to prove that they are faithful towards their religion.    
    
Read the same book, many times a day,     
every month, for years, read the same book     
Even for generations the same book    
    
If that much enthusiasm is there to read science,     
technology, politics, mathematics,     
environment, engineering, medical    
    
If people could graduate in those     
public reading classes from one level to another level.    
    
If people could show so much     
energy level for the group study of other subjects    
    
If people could congratulate each other     
for their graduation in those public reading classes    
    
Then, this world could have been a more humanly plane to live.    
    
But even after many years of human evolution     
Unfortunately, a human is still stuck in those     
Old books, which are not able to create human well being,     
peace on the planet, respect for the environment,     
respect for other creatures and other humans around    
    
And, still, we call human has evolved from     
an animal being to a human being.     
Do you think so?    
    
Even with all so-called science and technology     
Human is still wildest animal on this planet     
If you don’t believe that then     
Next 5 years remove all religious books     
Remove their ten commandments     
Remove their fear of hell and heaven     
Remove their fear of the law of karma     
And give them the best technology and     
environment for learning and best physical health.    
    
You think humans will be happy. Unfortunately not!     
Because there was almost no investment     
on making humans reasonable, sensible, and respectful to others.     
There is not enough sincere investment     
in teaching human about     
how to manage emotions, lust, temptation, greed, and anger.    
    
No matter what book they read     
some are violent all the time     
Some are waiting for little provocation     
So how to handle human society in this situation?    
    
Is it possible to make human society sensible     
and sensitive without religion?    
    
Can technology and science do that for humans?     
If no then why we are so much against the religion?    
    
Yes, religion has caused many problems     
in human society     
but why don’t we understand     
we reached to 21 century because of religion.    
    
The problem is not in religion     
This is an old tool to control and rule     
This always will remain.    
    
The problem is we don’t have the courage     
to reject those old books of religion     
and create a new book of love and respect for all.    
    
A thinker like Kabira &amp; Basavanna come and go     
But follower create another religion     
from the teachings of their masters     
And society again has different levels of conflicts.    
    
The problem is people think old is gold     
Mine is the oldest, my people told it long back, they were wise.    
    
We need to understand the question is not about     
my people or their people     
Neither the question is about     
who said what and when.    
    
The Question is can human keep aside something,     
which is not making sense for the well being of human,     
other lives around, environmental and mother earth.    
    
The question is can human think again, look forward     
Live with his senses and sensibly     
Live with his experience     
Do not live in a false paradise that I know     
my people know, my ancestor knew everything.     
But question everything around in a respectful way.    
    
O Pratibimba! Is this too much expectation     
From the human of this planet,     
That she/he keep aside all this morality,     
commandments and religion     
and live like human?

I am from the land of Thiruvalluvar,     
who never said he is secular     
I am from the land of Ram,     
who Valmiki referred Arya, not Aryan.    
    
I am not Hindu,     
foreigners have given me this identity     
This is not my identity     
I am not secular,     
The government in past has given me this identity     
I am not Aryan or Dravidian,     
Historians have given me this identity    
    
I am born on this land which is called     
Aryavrat, Bharat Khand, Jammu Dvipa     
Without any foreigners enforced identity.     
I am human and this is my true identity.    
    
I worship everything,     
I respect everything,     
I care for everything,     
But I surrender to the Truth     
And not to any God of any kind,     
Because I didn’t believe in any one God     
Word, God is again a foreign term for me.    
    
I know the Truth manifests in many forms,     
In an unmanifest state, I call him Brahman     
In the manifest grand visible form, I call him Ishwara     
When I pray to particular aspects of Ishwara,     
To seek help I call him Devta and Devi.     
I am a human, so I have a million types of desires.     
Hence, I pray to those many types of Devta-s or Devi-s.    
    
I am sick of this term secular,     
I am utterly confused with this word.     
I don’t understand the real meaning of this     
When everything in existence     
is of the God and God itself,     
When everything in the existence is sacred,     
Then how to assimilate this idea of secular?    
    
When I teach I am Brahmin,     
When I protect I am Kshatriya,     
When I do business I am Vaisya and     
When I serve I am sudra.     
I don’t understand why they broke me, and     
Created on more part and called that Dalit.    
    
In the first part of my life, I am Brahmachari,     
The second part of my life I am Grahasta,     
The third part of my life I am Vaanprasthi and     
The last phase of my life is Sanyasa     
I have these four Ashrama to live my full life.    
    
I don’t know why they dragged me     
In full-time money-making business, and     
Live alone without a home, without my society,     
And without my people around     
for the most part of my day to day work.    
    
I love music, devotion, and surrender and     
They call it the Hindu god song     
But when they play Bollywood or     
Hollywood movie song they call that secular.    
    
Cow milk is Hindu food and     
Alcohol is for socializing and for office parties     
Because alcohol is secular.    
    
What kind of mindset is this     
for which fume of a cigarette is secular     
And fume from pooja in the temple is Hindu?    
    
What kind of sickness is this     
Where rich has a naked body and they are secular     
And when a poor have a naked body he is a poor Hindu.    
    
What kind of mind is this for whom     
Mahatma Gandhi is the father of Bharat     
Bharat Mata ki Jai is Hindu dominance?    
    
What kind of mind is this where learning     
Lifeless subjects in the school, college or     
the university is secular education     
But teaching Yoga, Ayurveda, traditions,     
Vedic Math, true history is Hindu?    
    
What kind of coward mind is this which     
They Don’t want our children and society     
To know the true history,     
because they think Hindus is immature     
and will become revengeful after knowing the truth     
So they manipulate the truth.    
    
I consume the food based on     
my tradition, age, varna and     
body need because that is the demand     
of my physical, mental body and my profession,     
They call it you eat everything!     
You are valueless and immoral,     
You should eat this and not that     
because some vegetable, flowers     
and animals are secular and some not.    
    
Samskrut is a language     
In which even today 35 million manuscripts,     
Are not even understood by today’s society     
I think there is a lot to learn from the old text.     
But they call Samskrut is old,     
It is a Hindu language.     
It is a dead language.    
    
They use the court to force my priest to pray,     
in any other language but Samskrut.     
For years, I could not learn my own language     
because they fooled me and     
Today I cannot understand     
That old language of wisdom     
Forget about science, politics, mathematics     
Ayurveda, astronomy, war science, etc     
I cannot even understand the basic prayers in Samskrut.    
    
English is a secular language and     
Samskrut is communal and Hindu.     
First Jan is the secular date of year change     
and Chaitra Month is Hindu month.     
Christmas and Thanksgiving are secular     
and Diwali is a Hindu festival.    
    
I am sick of this secular and     
I am not Hindu.     
First, you gave me this name and     
Then attached all negative to this.    
    
You decide your name     
Don’t give me any name and identity     
After you define yourself,     
Whatever is left is me.    
    
I was born without an identity     
Let me live and die without identity     
I am Dharma driven     
But this Dharma for me     
changes based on time, space,     
situation and relationships.    
    
Don’t call me Hindu, and then     
show me your superiority of being secular    
    
I have traditions which you cannot understand     
I have methods to connect with the cosmos     
which you cannot understand     
I have many innumerable reasons to celebrate     
which you will not understand     
I have many festivals for a community celebration     
which you cannot appreciate    
    
So don’t give the name to your ignorance     
And throw that upon me.    
    
For politics, people need identities and Ideologies     
Those who respect me and my freedom     
One who doesn’t cage me in his words is my friend.    
    
For my survival, I need the support of society and power.     
Those who believe in values of true freedom, democracy     
And at the same time respect my nation     
Deserves my appreciation and vote.    
    
Not those who give me unnecessary identity     
Not those who claim themselves secular     
Not those who claim themselves religious    
    
I am Arya, the Nobel one     
Citizen of this planet     
I don’t know my origin in the space     
But on the banks of Sindhu, Ganga,     
Yamuna, Sarasawati my ancestors thrived     
And fought for their existence.    
    
This definition of secularism makes me sick     
and ignites unnecessary politics.    
    
O Pratibimba, you can call me Hindu,     
That shows your helplessness to define me     
But I am not secular nor I am religious     
I am bonded to my Dharma – relative responsibilities and duties     
And I live in Moksha (freedom),     
Live for Moksha – free from all evils of Human life.

## 24 Gurus of Dattatreya    
    
Namaste    
    
As per the Bhartiya wisdom stories Dattatrey is a son of Sage Attri & Mother Anusuya. Dattatreya is considered as one of the powerful Devata in our society. As per the stories he had 24 Gurus from nature. These Gurus have taught him the different aspects of life and living. Let’s see who are these Gurus of Dattatrey Maharaj and what are they teaching us. This is a **big story** and part of the eleventh Skanda of Bhagwatam. If you have time and want to enjoy the original full text then I would highly recommend you to read or listen to audio on this. In the interest of time, I am summarizing below the 24 Gurus of Dattatreya    
    
1. **The Water** (Jal): Always flows towards down and rest on the lowest point. If you want to settle in life then high is not the place but the lowest is the place. If you are a seeker of knowledge then that is always the place where people can shower their knowledge upon you.    
    
2. **The Earth** (Prithvi). Forgiveness and patience. Continuously move. Everything for others.    
    
3. **The Sky** (Akash). Rain, Fire, Air which are required for agriculture and producing grain comes from Akash. But Akash never claims on any of the produce. Live like Akash. Another property of the Akash is, it can never be contaminated.    
    
4. **The Air** (Prana Vaayu). We need little air to survive. We cannot take that more than our lungs capacity. Be content with small do not try to hoard, if you hold air for longer you will die. Secondly, when air is in control it is good when it is out of control, it becomes a cyclone. So, learn the importance of control from the air. We should have control over tongue, food, taste. Live a self-controlled life. Otherwise, it is a disaster for yourself and others. Outside Vaayu goes to all the places but does not get stuck in one place. So, keep moving in life.    
    
5. **The Fire** (Agni). The heat of the fire cannot be suppressed. It is an integral part of a fire. Fire consumes everything but doesn’t hold anything. Fire is present in wood always and sometimes comes out but when comes out it burns the same wood where it was resting. Uncontrolled anger in our life is like that.    
    
6. **The Sun** (Surya). Attracts water and finally throw that completely back to the earth. Similarly, noble people attract so many things but they never get attached or entangled to any.    
    
7. **The Moon** (Chandra). Based on the movement of the moon, it looks of different shape and sometimes completely disappears but, in reality, Moon is always complete. Its fullness is not affected by what we see. Atma in the body is complete, no matter whether we see it or not.    
    
8. **Ocean** (Samudra). The deeper ocean is always silent. No matter how much is the rain, it never crosses the boundary.    
    
9. **The Body** (Sharir). Body and pain both are related. As long as a body remains there are chances of pain occurring in life for you and others around. There is no hope that you have a body and never pain.    
    
10. **The Sense Organs** (Gyanendriya): Object attracts sense organs, the mind gets pulled because of sense organs, body part moves because of desires of mind to catch the objects around. So, till the time sense organs are not restrained and the mind is not trained there is no hope for happiness in life.    
    
11. **A Python** (Ajgar). If survival is the only goal, then Python does not move much from his place and all the food comes to him and he survives for many years. Not much effort is required for survival. So don’t waste your life just running for survival. Have some meaningful goals and work for that.    
    
12. **An Elephant** (Haathi). An elephant is so powerful that it cannot be controlled easily by humans. But just by showing one she-elephant, a mighty elephant can be captured without much effort. No matter how powerful you are, if you have some weakness then that is good enough for making you a slave.    
    
13. **A Dear** (Hiran). A musk deer keep running in the whole forest in the search of that smell that is coming from its own musk. A desire for enjoyment that is coming from our own mind keeps us running our whole life until we know the source of joy is inside like musk in the dear.    
    
14. **A Pigeon** (Kabootar). Excessive love or hate is the cause of pain and self-destruction. We need to learn when to let things go away.    
    
15. **A Fish** (Machali). No matter whether it is small fish or big fish, when they jump on the food and hook is inside their mouth they cannot run away. This way they become the food of others. Be careful when you choose your food, business, prospect. If you are careless then there are high chances that very soon you will become the food of others.    
    
16. **A Bumble Bee** (Bhavara). To takes its food, it goes to all kinds of flowers and does not suck the juices of only one flower. A saint or sadhu should not trouble only one place or village for his food. Keep moving, this way he will help society in many ways.    
    
17. **A Honey Bee** (Madhumakhi). Honey is accumulated by a honeybee by their hard work, but it is enjoyed by somebody else. So do not waste your energy in the accumulation of excess.    
    
18. **A Kite fly** (Patanga). Death of the kite fly happens when it falls in love with fire. It loves that fire so much that finally, it jumps into it. Therefore understand, in the longer run, excessive attraction to the opposite sex will cause you grief and nothing much.    
    
19. **A Crow** (Kurur Pakshi). A crow hold meat in his beak is flying speedily and an eagle follows him. A crow thinks that the eagle is his enemy and keeps flying with more and more speed till the time when he cries for help and meat piece fall on the ground and eagle run away. Then crow realizes I was not the enemy but this eagle had eyes on my food. Sometimes when you feel the entire world is after you then let things go. You will come to know everything is fine.    
    
20. **A Spider** (Makadi). Create its own web, travels in that, and finally consumes it. The creator creates the world in the same way, lives in it, and consumes it by his own illusionary powers.    
    
21. **A Honey Extractor** (Madhuha). No matter how many honey bee hive around in the forest, Madhuha goes and takes only that much which is required for his need. He doesn’t accumulate that which is not the need of the day.    
    
22. **An Arrow Maker** (Baan Banena Wala). If your attention on your work is supreme then that engrossment is enough to forget the entire world around you.    
    
23. **A Girl** (Kanya). When there is a single bangle in the hand no matter what work she does it does not make any noise. If you want to live a life that is free of conflict and fight then the only way is to live alone.    
    
24. **A Small Boy** (Balak): Without bothering about their ego, they will fight and within a few minutes they will start playing together again.

Today I am using this space to provoke you to ask subtler questions and know the answer from your experience. There is no answer below but many questions for you. Enjoy reading.    
    
Namaste    
    
We talk so much about the mind     
But can you locate your mind in your body?     
Don’t point your finger towards your head     
That is the location of another     
the physical part of your body called the brain    
    
The brain is another hardware in our body     
like heart, kidney, eyes etc.     
Nothing special to hold the mind in it.    
    
So, the puzzle is this.     
Where is our mind located?     
What are the functions of the mind?     
Is it possible to see the mind,     
Or it is like a ghost, unseen,     
And known only through its Karma?    
    
Observe the physical phenomenon world around     
Solidity is the epitome of physicality     
Mark the order of solidity for following     
Food on a plate, water in a glass,     
Cotton on a cotton flower,     
The air around you, ideas in your mind,     
Restlessness in your body     
Unrest in society, Laugh of children     
Cry of a helpless being, your feeling of love, hate, etc.     
Your desire to win, to create, to enjoy     
Social injustice around you.    
    
What is the nature of that     
which shakes the human heart     
which keeps human in action     
which keep human running     
Is that Physical or non-physical?    
    
A physical is that     
Which can be located     
Which can be measured     
Can be created, destroyed, and converted     
Can be displaced     
Can change the form and the state.     
Thus matter is physical.    
    
Energy is nothing but less density matter     
The same energy when condensate     
Takes different states of physical existence around    
    
They say mind does not matter     
But can we say the mind is not a matter?    
    
Post-death, when the rental body is given back     
to the owner of the body, the Mother earth     
Then they say mind transports to another body     
Dharmic traditions called this rebirth.    
    
Atma is eternally free and pure     
What is that which you want to purify     
by your actions of different types?    
    
What is that part of your body     
which does not have memories?     
even your skin has memories     
that is the reason your skin color is like what it is.    
    
In the poetical world, it is good to express that     
The mind thinks and the heart feels     
But in reality, is that true?     
Think again, what is special in the heart     
for which you give it the responsibility of feeling?     
The heart is another physical part of the body like brain.     
There is no comparison between     
a physical and another,     
which is not solidly as physical.    
    
What is the resting place of our     
hope, emotion, creativity, dreams?     
Is this just another form of chemical energy?     
If so, then why don’t we create     
the best chemical energy for our joy     
rather than running around the world for our joy?    
    
What is conciseness?     
Consciousness is the effect of the physical lives around     
or Consciousness is the cause of entire physical creation?     
Including the physical space and time.    
    
What is awareness?     
Awareness is a cause or effect of consciousness?     
Is awareness possible in an unconscious being?     
Is a conscious being always aware of the surroundings?    
    
Oh Pratibimba, contemplate on this     
with your meditative mind,     
Which you cannot locate     
But it can locate everything for you.

# Article5055 : The Power For Prayer    
tags: [ Poetry, Prayers]    
    
Namaste    
    
If you believe there is no power in the prayer     
Then you can stop doing any prayer of any type.     
If you believe there is power in the prayer     
Then what we reap in our life has     
influence of the prayer of people around us.    
    
Pratibimba had a very good friend     
They both lived together for a long     
They fought, argued, disagreed with each other     
But the sign of love always remain in their heart     
Sign of love was respect, care, no ill will,     
no ill intentions, giving a free space     
to each other to experience the world around,     
and ultimately coming back     
to support each other in all ups and downs of life    
    
One day because of some fate     
they went away from each other     
Over a period of time, they had differences     
Finally, they parted away     
on their journey, both with heavy hearts    
    
Pratibimba decided to remain positive     
So he always prayed for the good health and mind of his friend     
He prayed for a good heart, which is full of love,     
compassion and care for his friend     
In his prayers, his friend was included.    
    
His friend became bitter, because of the circumstances.     
He prayed ill fate, disease, losses,     
defeat and death for his friend     
His heart became black with the experience     
So he prayed worse for his friend.    
    
Time passed, Pratibimba remained positive     
But he had lots of problems in his life     
Had many legal cases, defame, loss of money     
this is what his friend prayed for him.    
    
On the other hand, his friend had a normal life     
But his friend’s heart started melting     
He became sweet, full of love, compassion,     
respect and care for all around     
So he became positive and     
compassionate for Pratibimba.     
This change of heart happened     
because of prayer from Pratibimba    
    
One day Pratibimba’s friend     
decided to search Pratibimba     
Finally, he could find his whereabouts     
He found Pratibimba has lost everything in life     
Struggling for his life on the hospital bed     
But he is still praying     
for his friend and the world around him.    
    
When his friend went to meet     
Pratibimba in the hospital     
His heart broke and he cried     
He said to God, why did you hear my prayers     
And brought so much unfortunate to my friend.    
    
Pratibimba was happy and ecstatic     
The tear was flowing from his eyes,     
After seeing his friend before he died     
He said to God thank you so much for listening,     
to my prayers and making my friend     
a sweet and compassionate     
But what is this, today I cannot utter a word     
I cannot raise my hands to wipe his tears.    
    
Such is the power of prayer     
It definitely brings results     
It may take time     
but never goes unheard    
    
Therefore don’t wish ill,     
even for your enemy.     
Who knows, this has a seed     
of you being guilt in your life    
    
Time moves in a circle     
Life moves in a circle along with time.     
When an enemy becomes friends     
or friends become enemy,     
only time knows.    
    
Oh wise reader, can you find     
which a friend gained more from his prayers?     
Don’t be in hurry, think again

## About Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)    
    
Namaste    
    
Corporate Social Responsibility is a concept    
Where a corporate should own the responsibility of society.    
They should not simply make a profit, share the profit    
among the employees, investors & other stakeholders.    
But should consider society around    
as an integral part of their existence to survive.    
But why should any corporate do this CSR program?    
Because they are large fish in the pond    
therefore they should show compassion to the others    
and hence do not eat all the fishes of pond together    
otherwise, they themselves will in danger?    
Because society has given the platform to perform    
therefore they should reciprocate?    
Because they should comply with government regulations?    
Because they will get more name and fame    
as a compassionate organization    
and they can capitalize on that power to grow further    
and cover up their wrongs of past, present, and future?    
Any sensible person need to understand    
no one can exist longer in isolation,    
so it is about the entire ecosystem.    
In an ecosystem every individual    
no matter how small they are    
they play some significant role.    
If you try to manipulate the system    
and alter some element of the ecosystem    
then there are consequences of it.    
By doing so either you change    
the rules of the game unilaterally, which is unfair    
or the entire system comes to danger because of your actions.    
    
In an ecosystem, no matter how small    
or insignificant is a microbe    
do not kill it, it has its own utility.    
    
When a factory makes some product,    
it uses natural resources and pollutes the natural resources    
Which was right of the local citizens of that area    
Therefore, it is the responsibility of the corporate    
to share the profit with the local citizens.    
But, how to share?    
Going around distributing money does not make sense.    
So they put equipment,    
which measure the pollution    
which controls the pollution    
which ensure minimum usage of the local resources    
But that is their primary responsibility,    
that is the way should do business    
It is not a CSR!    
When they reach the local society    
help them improve their life around    
by hiring local people for jobs, planting a tree,    
sponsoring education, health, food expense of the poor around    
Developing roads, park, community hall    
These are all part of the responsibilities of a corporate.    
In Indian ancient wisdom traditions    
It is mentioned that    
There are four purposes of human life    
Work for Dharma, Work for earning money,    
Work for Enjoyment, Work for Moksha.    
And they go only in this sequence    
without changing the order.    
Dharma is the Duty, Responsibility of the individual    
towards others in the surrounding.    
When you exist you share many relationships    
with many people and entities around    
There is nothing unconnected and unrelated in the existence.    
And that relationship obliges you to perform    
your responsibility towards them    
It is not about your large-heartedness,    
compassion, pity, or generosity.    
It is just because it is your Dharma,    
it is your responsibility.    
Nobody should teach you,    
neither you should feel that    
you are doing something great.    
You must know this is    
my Dharma, Duty, Responsibility.    
This concept of Dharma applies    
to all power centers and lives    
You as an individual have Dharma    
You as an organization has Dharma    
You as an institution has Dharma    
The state has its Dharma towards citizen and all others living around    
Rastra has its Dharma towards the citizen.    
In Dharma, there is eternally going Yagnya.    
Yagnya is possible only when all the stakeholders participate    
If any of the stakeholders do not participate    
or participate half-heartedly    
then very soon Yagnya will come    
to halt and subsequently to the end.    
CSR is a gesture of gratitude of an organization    
towards the surrounding.    
It is a kind of Yagnya,    
It is part of their core business    
It literally says thank you so much    
You gave us an opportunity to exist, survive and thrive    
Therefore as long as I am living around    
I will do my best possible for the surrounding.    
And by doing so,    
I am indirectly supporting my own survival.    
Ideally, CSR activities should be done    
in the area and with the surrounding society.    
A location where an organization physically exists,    
produces, serves, and consumes.    
This is not fair you earn from X locality, district, state, or country,    
and being multinational perform or sponsor CSR activities    
in Y locality, district, state, or country.    
If that is the case then    
why X should allow you to exist at their place?    
Simply because you have the protection of the law!    
In today’s time, we find there are super-rich organizations    
Who have earned a lot from society    
Either by doing business in the right way or    
smart way or deceitful way or by leveraging technology    
    
Some of there organizations feel a sense of gratitude    
and they give some portion of their profit to the CSR program    
And media reports it as their big-heartedness    
Obviously, it is their big heart    
Otherwise generally with huge money    
heart of the people shrink for others or it becomes stone.    
There are many super-rich people around who give money    
But for a specific community and specific purpose    
They want to make sure that even in the CSR    
their own agenda should remain on top    
They give money to NGO for conversion,    
lobbying against the certain rule,    
lobbying against the government,    
to register protest against their opponent,    
get played in the hand of the enemy    
and do more harm to society    
than serving society    
and expressing gratitude.    
CSR is not about the activities of those    
who are making a profit    
CSR is not only about the engagement of big companies    
CSR is not brand building    
CSR is not about giving adventure opportunities to your employees    
CSR is not about a scheme to make your employees happy    
    
No matter what happens    
CSR is your responsibility to express gratitude    
Towards those who have given you shelter    
After becoming rich it is easy to say    
I pay taxes to a government    
I do business in an ethical way    
I am keeping my employees and partners happy    
I have money I can go anywhere    
Why should I spend my money on these    
beggars and poor around    
But this is not humanity!    
    
To be happy, survive, and thrive    
an organization need to spend upon their employees    
So, do not be short-sighted and small-hearted    
and limit your family only to those    
who is reporting to you on daily basis?    
Spend time with the society around    
Teach them, plant the tree for them,    
Conserve water with them,    
Conserve electricity with them,    
Celebrate festivals with them    
    
As per the government rule    
CSR funding by an organization    
should be done as some percentage of their profit.    
But, even when you are not able to make the profit    
Go out and express a sense of gratitude    
for the ecosystem around.    
    
When your employees go out and you pay them    
It is your CSR,    
But, when your employees take leave and go out    
It is your investment in developing wonderful human being    
This is how the spirit of CSR should be.    
Oh, wise reader, what do you think is true CSR?

## About Enjoyment    
    
Namaste,    
    
Life is a process and in life we do processes     
Something is given to us as an input     
We do some actions on the given input     
And we produce some output     
Input is never 100% in our control. But, the quantity and quality of the benefits     
depends upon how the output of a process     
is perceived by the receiver.    
    
The output of a process and     
Benefits of the output of the process     
are two completely different things    
    
Even though input is not in your control     
It is expected that you control the output     
By your will, skills, and hard work     
You can try and influence that to a great extent.    
    
But, the benefits are are not that straight forward     
Benefits are always about perceptions.    
    
Managing output of a process     
where you have control may be easier.     
But managing perception is never easy.    
    
No matter what is the quality of output     
If a receiver has a negative impression     
about you, your team, your company, and your product     
then it may be futile to try to convince.    
    
If blocker in the receiver     
is knowledge then you can try.     
But, if the blocker is as subtle as ideology,     
philosophy, blind faith, eroded trust     
then how do you convince     
the benefits of the output of your work?    
    
If we live a conscious life then     
input for our actions can be filtered and purified.     
Actions can be improved     
and output can be most probable as desired.    
    
But, even with the highest consciousness     
and the best output you may not     
deliver the benefits as expected.    
    
If we want to control the uncontrollable (benefits)     
And let go of the controllable (actions) in your life     
Then life is going to be full of boredom,     
rejection, loneliness, tiredness, and frustrations.    
    
And all this lead to a search     
for other means of enjoyments     
That is why for most Friday is beautiful     
and Monday is stressful.    
    
Reflection on benefits and output of our actions     
helps us improving our actions     
it also helps improving input criteria     
But how to do it if all the time focus is fear of failure?    
    
It is easy to say keep eye on the goal and work hard     
But practicality if all the time you remain     
obsessed about goal and benefits to others     
You will miss life, you miss the process,     
you miss the game, and finally     
you may miss the output and benefits.    
    
Whether in life or in business     
If I know what is the purpose of business     
what is the purpose of my role     
What I am supposed to do,     
Then acquired the right skills to do the work at hand     
Then why should I keep the goal always in my head all the time?     
Cannot I do it playfully?    
    
No matter how much trained we are     
If we are always on high alert     
If we are always working under the cloud of fear of failure     
We are going to get broke very soon     
With all money in our bank     
Is this what we want to earn     
at the end of the month or year?    
    
Just think about who is happier     
A musician who is playing to make the audience happy     
or a musician who is playing to enjoy his best    
    
A sportsman who want to ensure that his team should win     
or a sportsman who is playing his best.    
    
A project manager who wants to get     
five-star rating from his customer     
or a manager who does his best to deliver what is needed.    
    
A person who prepares food to demonstrate his culinary skills     
or a person who is putting his best to make nutritious food.    
    
A soldier who is fighting his enemy to demonstrate his bravery     
or a person who is ready to die in the war and     
never bother what happens after his death.    
    
Whether you are a manager or musician,     
artists or scientist, employee or employer,     
daily wage worker or contractor,     
soldier or a farmer     
If you always focus on the benefit     
then stress is part of your life     
To create happiness for other     
and make money for your family     
do not earn miseries for yourself.    
    
Whether it is reading or walking,     
Doing accounting work or managerial work     
Doing research or creating a piece of art     
Sooner or later we need to learn,     
how to keep money, recognition, other’s happiness aside    
    
Sooner we need to learn     
how to enter into the game of life     
Acquire all the skills to play the game,     
improve our skills every day     
And play our game in the best way     
If we enjoy a game the best     
Then it matters least what happens to the output of the game     
It matters least who is happy with you or who not     
It matters least how to manage perceptions.    
    
Ask yourself, you are working because you are happy     
Or you are working for happiness?    
    
O Pratibimba! Is it so difficult to understand?     
or Cosmos has written some other fate of human?

# Article5058 : Meditation Perspective Of A Practitioner    
tags: [ Concepts, Mindfulness, Yoga]    
    
Namaste    
    
An English word Meditation has many meanings     
Today I sharing my perceptive on a Samskrut word Dhyanam,     
which is an integral part of Indian yogic traditions.    
    
Meditation is a process.     
We know any process has input, activities, and output.    
    
The duration of this process can be as short a 12 seconds.     
With this duration, we call it Dharana or concentration.     
The duration of Medication can be as large as life itself.    
    
The larger is the duration more is awareness.     
When the duration is large, the final output doesn’t matter.     
Because every moment you pass in that state     
a transformation is happening in you.     
This is the state of oneness.    
    
The degree of oneness depends upon     
the intensity of your meditation, your nature,     
and the framework being used.     
In that state, breaking the meditation     
and coming out to receive the benefits is not wise.    
    
Is output wonderful?     
The answer for that is you need to jump in     
the water to know the joy of swimming.     
Don’t ask it others.    
    
This is a process of awareness     
This is a process of dissolving your physical identity.     
This is a process of identifying yourself as nonphysical.     
This is a process of identifying yourself with the creator.    
    
This is a process of disassociation     
yourself from the entities and events around.     
This is a process of dissolving     
all named relationships.     
This is a process of owning     
only one relationship with the world around.     
The relation of a mother.     
Knowing that I am conceiver and deliverer     
of the phenomenon world around.    
    
Now, let’s see the inputs of this process     
To enter into a meditative state,     
when this process effortlessly happens in you     
you need some preparation.     
This preparation prepares     
quality input for the process.    
    
Thus input should be clean, pure, and pious     
What does it mean?     
This means the body and the mind     
with which you want to perform this process     
Should be stable, healthy, and clean.    
    
Any pain in the body, and desire     
of good or bad in the mind,     
any emotional and sensational     
disturbance in mind     
will toxify the input.    
    
Garbage in garbage out     
is the principle of process engineering.    
    
Like a copper pot, the more you clean more it shines,     
An extremely dirty pot     
if you clean for two minutes it will be clean.    
    
But it will not be as clean     
as it becomes after your rub it for ten minutes.     
If you use lemon or tamarind it will be cleaner.     
This way more time you spend to clean,     
and the higher quality material you use     
to clean more cleaner will be the copper pot.    
    
More cleaner the pot     
For more duration, you can use it     
for your rituals without cleaning again.    
    
A healthy mind and body is like that     
We know it will never be the perfect     
But our efforts to keep the input clean     
and healthy will impact the process and its outcome.    
    
After input, let us now see activities.     
Activities depend upon a method     
or a framework or a system or traditions you choose.     
You can customize these methods     
based on your need and nature     
But the overall architecture of one system remains the same.    
    
Vipassana, Shambhavi, Shoonya,     
Kundalini, Zen, Transcendental, etc     
are a few examples of the frameworks.     
A framework may emphasize more on breathing     
Or sensation or imagination or sound     
or taste or smell or Akasa or an object     
or combination of these.    
    
Some framework gives importance to the place,     
environment, body motions, and movements of eyes.     
But all emphasize on the presence of mind     
in present and awareness.    
    
Because of other life priorities,     
if you have to exit the process     
and move into either daily mundane activities     
or challenging activities     
the impact of a few minutes of intense meditation     
remains with you a whole day.    
    
How long it will remain     
it depends upon how intense was your meditation,     
what kind of activities you do a whole day,     
what environment you live in.     
what are your food and drink habits?    
    
If you avoid doing this process     
to gain some power,     
which can be used     
for your physical enjoyment     
then it will give you better results.    
    
If you do this process     
to learn how to be a witness     
of all the phenomenon world around     
be it creation or destruction,     
be it birth or death,     
be it make or break,     
be it loss or profit,     
be it coming and going     
then more you will be blessed by this process.    
    
Don’t do this process with any expectation     
(productivity, peace of mind, good relationship etc)     
Don’t do this process for any gain of future     
Don’t do this process for pleasing or showing others     
Even if you are doing it before your Deity, don’t do it for the Deity.     
Don’t do this process for acquiring occult powers.    
    
Do this process, out of love and respect     
As this is the best biggest things     
which our ancestors could give to us     
Do this process to live in the present     
for a few moments of the day.    
    
Results need not be seen and praised by others     
The result need not be explained to others     
But results will transform the way you see     
Life around, relationship, work,     
gain-loss, pain-pleasure around.    
    
O Pratibimba, could I inspire you     
for experiencing this wonderful gift     
which is available only for humans?

# Article5059 : About Forgiveness    
tags: [ Concepts, Philosophy]    
    
Namaste    
    
Forgiveness doesn’t mean you do something to others,     
It doesn’t mean you let go of others free for the crime     
which others have done against you.    
    
Forgiveness is not forgetfulness.     
Forgetfulness happens in unconscious living.     
Forgiveness is possible only when you live a conscious life.    
    
It doesn’t mean you are weak.     
Neither it mean that you are strong     
and powerful to forgive others.    
    
It means you want to reject worries.     
It means you want to reject bitterness.     
It means you want to reject thinking in the past and future     
It means you want to reject hurtful constantly thinking     
about one event or a person or community.    
    
It means you are not interested in getting stuck in cyclical life.     
It means you want to move ahead in life.    
    
It means you are choosing life.     
It means you are choosing a present.     
It means you are choosing progression     
And rejecting regression.    
    
It means you believe in the law of karma,     
And you believe there is no real forgive in the existence.     
It means you believe existence will settle things automatically,     
And my actions can make things worse in life.    
    
It means your reaction will cause a chain of karma     
And I want to exit from that chain.    
    
So forgiveness is your choice in wisdom and awareness     
Do not give it poetical expression     
and writing sweet quotes and poems on it.    
    
Don’t assume that you need to have the strength to forgive.     
What exactly you need is wisdom.     
A pearl of wisdom which unfolds the future of regrets     
in the present and tells you     
that don’t choose death over life.    
    
O Pratibimba, when forgiveness takes us away from death     
and give us a fresh new breeze of life     
then why it is so hard to forgive?     
Are people more interested in dying?     
or they are not wise enough to choose forgiveness?     
or they are completely unaware of the consequence of not forgiving?     
or they think that who will teach if I forgive?     
or they think it is a sign of weakness?    
    
or they foolishly see life in every moment of dying?

# Article5060 : Rider On Freedom    
tags: [ Concepts, Education, Philosophy]    
    
Namaste    
    
Is it possible to tame a human mind without religion?    
    
Is it necessary we need to tame a human mind or     
all should have equal freedom to think and do?    
    
Why use dos and don’ts of religion?     
Why use heaven and hell of religion to bring humans to senses?    
    
Is there any relationship between religion and democracy?    
    
Religion wants to control either through ruler or priest.    
    
The democratic system gives freedom     
to think, eat, worship, earn, spend, etc to all its citizens.    
    
In non-democratic societies     
a group of powerful people thinks     
on behalf of their society.    
    
Democracy has many assumptions.     
The first assumption is     
All citizens are matured enough to make     
their decisions for themselves.     
Is this assumption valid?    
    
The second assumption is     
Any decision of one citizen     
does bring joy and problem only for oneself     
So let them do whatever required for their own happiness.     
But does it happens?    
    
But the same democracy doesn’t allow     
citizens to do suicide, rob and cheat others,     
Democracy of a citizen ends     
where the democracy of other citizen starts.    
    
So we have overlapping boundaries     
Which I enjoy, you don’t like,     
Which you enjoy, I don’t like.    
    
So, how to settle in these situations.     
Either in public or private life     
People still chose that age-old tricks     
Exercise the power to force others.     
Power may be of position or senior relations     
or age seniority or money or muscles.    
    
But, in a democracy the tool to settle the issues     
is not any weapon or force or thrashing     
The tool is to open your mouth, discuss, debate, and defend.    
    
Unfortunately all people     
do not have some patience     
and skills to articulate, debate, argue     
Thus they chose either to remain silent or fight physically.     
Both are not good for democracy.    
    
The third assumption in a democracy is     
the citizens are educated     
and can speak effectively on their behalf     
or can hire someone easily who can speak on their behalf.     
But, is this true? Is it easy?    
    
The fourth assumption is democracy is     
Once you are 18 years old     
then you are a citizen of the country     
Now, you have become mature enough     
to think for yourself and make your own decision.     
But does it happens?     
Is our education system     
and social structure makes us matured     
by the time we reach 18?     
Can we really think     
what is good and whatnot for us?    
    
Democratic laws give freedom but put a rider     
If someone misuses that freedom to harm others,     
nation, society, etc then there is a punishment.     
But what is the definition of “misuse”?    
    
Law is taking away that freedom,     
to create your own definition of “misuse”     
Courtroom debates decide what is “misuse”.    
    
Interestingly, either the exerciser of the freedom     
is ignorant or behave like that     
but in reality, there is     
no “real absolute freedom” as per the law.    
    
This freedom is available only to those     
who chose to live wisely     
whether a constitution exists or not.    
    
Because a democratic constitution     
is an unwritten law in nature     
“live and let others live”    
    
Crooked want to interpret that     
as per their whims and fancy     
And suppress others.    
    
Sometimes using the democratic laws     
they are successful in doing so.    
    
That is why in Hindu traditions     
we consider Dharma is over the Law.     
People can manipulate the law of the land     
and get a favorable decision for themselves     
But, the Dharma brings justice for all.    
    
So there are riders for Freedom     
And freedom is available in a democracy     
But you fail to get freedom either     
because someone crooked you or     
you were too weak or too fragile     
to protect yourself then Dharma delivers that justice.    
    
O wise reader, Freedom, Democracy, Education,     
Boldness to defend yourself and Fearlessness     
all cyclical are interrelated.     
Think yourself, from where you want to start.

# Article5061 : Leadership In Troubled Time    
tags: [ Concepts, Philosophy, 'Philosophy for Business']    
    
Enough we read, hear and lecture     
Especially in the management profession and leadership positions.     
Life every moment unfolds surprises     
Many bring joy and others brings failure and sadness together.    
    
We know success has many fathers     
But there is no father of failure     
Beyond the words, quotes, and poems     
Many times in life we need to experience     
all that severe pain in our life to understand.    
    
Sitting in one place, we want to experience     
what we understand is imagination.     
On the other hand, we understand and comprehend     
that what we experience is true life.    
    
We all know win-lose, success and failure is part of life     
Taking responsibilities, blaming others     
is part of a regular business game.    
    
By chance or by choice     
How many times you are at a place where you should be     
And empathize the way it should be.    
    
It never comes from rehearsing,     
acting & repeating those old quotes     
But it comes spontaneously.    
    
Photographers may catch or miss the moment     
But you as a leader never fail to fill the other’s     
heart with hope and energy     
And say without speaking –     
Stand up and bounce back.    
    
See this 30 seconds Video, Another Angle     
This comes at the last moment failure of Chandrayaan 2     
Watch the emotions of two great leaders     
One is the tallest political leader of all time     
and another is a leader of ISRO.    
    
Enemy states, political commentators,     
critics will pass their own comments.     
And that is their profession.     
But you observe it yourself     
Ask, how many times you have this kind of boss around?     
How many times you are this kind of boss for your team?    
    
I am not a fortune teller     
But mark my words,     
if these two people have enough life     
to serve the nation     
they will do exceptional work for the science     
and in turn for the society     
because of that emotional energy and support,     
Which is expressed at tough moments of life.    
    
Beyond the boardroom meetings,     
presentations, metrics, chilling review meetings,     
competition, firing, and criticizing people around.     
Can we demonstrate this kind of warmth?     
Can we fill our team with this kind of energy?     
Very difficult, why?    
    
Because you need to be absolutely fearless to do this.    
    
If one is not professional,     
doesn’t know his work     
doesn’t have the required skills     
doesn’t do his work in an utmost selfless way    
    
will have fear of his job, criticism, reputation     
That kind of people can never transfer this kind of energy.    
    
Every organizations or person work for the goal,     
some get success and some not     
But only those live     
Who lives with unconditional     
empathy, humanity to a dedicated team.

# Article5062 : What Is Violence    
tags: [ Concepts, 'Ethics & Morality', Philosophy]    
    
Namaste,    
    
In nature every entity has life.     
Life means takes birth, grows, decay, and die.     
Look around and identify     
what is that which is permanently there?     
A lifetime of life may vary     
from microseconds to billions of years.     
But everything comes into existence and disappears.    
    
Every life has its parts     
e.g. human life has parts like head, hand, feet, brain, etc.     
and all parts put together make a complete system.    
    
The system automatically consumes     
the necessary things from the surrounding     
without much efforts     
like air, water, etc     
provided they are available     
in good quality and quantity     
else system and in turn life need to struggle.    
    
If struggle fails then the system collapses     
and living body die.     
This principle applies to all lives     
including plants, insects, animals, etc.    
    
Every system automatically throw away     
some waste, which is not required by the system     
If the waste does not come out automatically     
then system and life need to struggle to throw away     
if struggle fails then life get disease and     
dies over time with that disease.    
    
The automatic output of every system is different     
in a plant, it is a leaf, fruits, flowers, etc.     
in the animal being it is milk, urine, poo, sweat, nails, hair, etc.    
    
Nature has made a system in such a way that     
every output of some living system     
is input and survival for other life.     
Nothing goes waste.    
    
The only question is a particular output     
becomes the input for whom.     
e.g. waste of cut vegetables     
can be food for cows or maggots.     
Depends on how sensibly you generate output     
And how sensibly you feed the next system.    
    
Now the truth is     
if the input is not available     
to a particular living entity     
at the time of need then it will die.    
    
There may be an abundance of food in the world     
But time and place of the availability matters     
If fertilizer is not available at the root of the plants then it dies     
If insects are not available to the birds in their area then they die     
If the grass is not given to the cow then she dies    
    
Every life fights its best for survival before it dies     
Herbivores, carnivores, omnivores     
has a different kind of fights and with different lives.     
This fight for the survival of the self is violence.    
    
The least violence is done by those     
who cannot travel like plants and trees?    
    
Most violence is done by human     
who can do anything     
even make or buy sophisticated equipment     
to fight and win at any price.    
    
If enough is available then     
animals, birds, plants do not fight     
with each other for survival.    
    
But the fight of human looks illogical.     
Even if enough is available he wants     
to have more for tomorrow     
not only for him but for his own people     
not only for one or two days survival     
but for the time till he dies     
And he thinks he will never die     
So keep in the go-down     
as much as possible    
    
So they turn houses into go-down     
Without realizing that if they die tomorrow     
There is not container service available     
for the place where they go after death.    
    
Human does not fight only for body survival     
but the survival of his ideas and thoughts post his death.    
    
A human fights for the ideas     
of somebody whom he likes     
i.e. Communist and leftist     
people fight for the ideals of Karl Marks     
and Gandhian people fight     
for the ideas of Mahatma Gandhi.    
    
Human fights for his group.     
A human fights for the dominance over others.     
Human fights for proving himself right.    
    
Human creates something for peace and harmony     
and if somebody disturbs that     
then human fights for that also     
i.e human fights for religion.     
Basically, religion is a system for peace and harmony.     
But a human fight for that as well.    
    
A Human fights for his taste.     
If he like the taste of something     
then whether it is live or dead     
must be served on his plate for his enjoyment.    
    
To survive every living needs some input.     
If that is not easily available then     
life fights with the other lives in nature.    
    
Look it from the human perspective     
when we fight we get mental and physical exertion     
and with whom we fight the same happens to that as well.    
    
Let us assume for sometime     
you are living in a far village     
In that village, there is only one home     
and you are alone in that home    
    
Today you are feeling hungry     
you want something and nothing is available around     
so you need to struggle.    
    
You enter into a forest next to the village     
and you find a dead goat; running chicken;     
freshly fallen fruits from the tree; other hanging fruits,    
    
Ask yourself what will you do     
and what will you eat?     
Fallen fruit or hanging fruit or     
catch the running chicken or cook the dead goat.     
It will help you understanding     
how violent you are on a day to basis.    
    
This is not a question of religion     
This is not a question of survival     
When enough is available then     
what we prefer to eat is a matter of taste!    
    
Every living being does violence for the survival     
Eating a fallen fruit is one kind of violence     
Plucking the fruit from the tree is another kind of violence     
Eating a dead goat is one kind of violence     
Eating a running chicken is another kind of violence    
    
The highest degree of violence is where     
eater and eaten both fights     
for survival and both are emotional beings.    
    
Ask yourself in nature     
Whatever input you are consuming     
is made for your survival or     
some other kind of life is entitled to that.    
    
The biggest problem is     
human thinks life on the earth     
is made by the god for him.     
So if we do not enjoy then who will enjoy it.     
The thought that this phenomenal world is human-centric     
is the disease of the human mind.     
And this is the cause of high violence.    
    
Oh Pratibimba, it is possible to cure this disease by compassion?

# Article5063 : Human Is Rotating Or Travelling    
tags: [ Concepts, Philosophy]    
    
When stars and planets walk in the space     
we call they are rotating around something else like earth or sun or galaxy.     
Why their movement is called “rotation”     
and not the straight-line traveling towards the goal?    
    
Because we are watching them for long     
and it looks as if they are not going anywhere.     
But, did we asked them?    
    
It may be that they think they are going in a straight line     
and their life has a purpose!     
Sometimes traveler doesn’t know     
but observers know where the traveler is going.    
    
We humans also do the same thing.     
Rotating on this round planet for a maximum of 100 years     
and we think life has a purpose and we are going in a straight line.    
    
Ask someone who is outside     
and observing humans from a far distance     
the way we observe spatial objects.     
It may be that we are doing the same thing     
as we think about planets.    
    
What is the truth?     
Rotating around or going in a straight line?     
We all have assumptions and beliefs     
but no one knows about the direction of human movement.    
    
Some believe they are going towards heaven,     
some beliefs towards hell,     
some belief going nowhere,     
some believe the earth is the starting and endpoint,     
some believe Moksha or liberation is the final goal,     
some believe we are rotating and this is the only goal,     
some believe we are going in a straight line with a definite goal,     
some believe we decide where we go,     
some believe the environment decides,     
some believe God decides,     
some believe our samskara decides the movement and direction.    
    
Do you think the creator knows the answer with certainty?     
Don’t ask me about the location and direction of the creator!

# Article5064 : Most Prayer Worthy Self Mind    
tags: [ Concepts, Philosophy, Prayers]    
    
## Whom should we pray?    
    
## Most Prayer Worthy is the Mind of Self!    
    
Whether we pass an exam or not,     
get married or not,     
have children or not,     
get loved or not,     
children do well or not,     
health improves or not,     
living alone or in a crowd,     
become rich or not all this is secondary.    
    
The first thing we should have been taught     
how to handle our own very powerful mind.     
If my mind is my best friend     
then every other relationship, object,     
the surrounding can be handled wisely.    
    
If this mind is my enemy then no friend,     
relative, mother, father, or god can help me.     
I don’t need an enemy in the world     
this enemy is always with me     
except when I fall asleep.    
    
Which education, relation, university     
teaches human how to handle his own mind.     
Unfortunately, all learn their own way.    
    
For most the way is to give the mind whatever it wants     
and for others, the way is to torture the mind,     
restrain it, and control it.     
There are some who think the mind is like a monkey     
so handle it like a monkey     
carrot and stick, reward, and punishment.    
    
Ancient Rushis, ॠषी, told us     
watch your mind and enjoy the drama it does     
when it throws and moves     
the body in the world.    
    
Watch carefully how it feels joy and pain     
when being loved and hated,     
loving and hating,     
eating and eaten,     
winning and losing,     
fiddling with objects and people around     
and thinking this will make me happy     
and then jumping to other things.    
    
Oh my mind, I don’t want anything,     
no god, no friend, no relationship, no objects     
but you as my best friend.     
When you are my best friend     
I can manage myself     
in all situations richness and poorness,     
in the crowd and in loneliness,     
loved or hated by people,     
recognized or ignored,     
win the entire world or     
lose everything except you.    
    
So prayer, worship, and blessings     
of the mind of self is the greatest prayer.     
Hence, the Most Prayer Worthy is the Mind of Self!     
Pray to your mind with your controlled mind.

# Article5065 : Raw Material To Create Space And Time    
tags: [ Concepts, Philosophy, Science, Vedanta]    
    
Time (Kaala) is 100% mind’s creation.     
There is no physical time.     
Akasha is the “voidness” of objects.     
But, what Object? Atom or Mango or Table or planet?    
    
All objects are in the space and have space inside.     
So sensory perception of human is different     
and it is different for microbiological being.     
For us, microparticles don’t exist in normal sensory experience     
so there is void and hence Akasha     
That is why we wave our hand in the air     
and say there is nothing.     
But for the microbe, it is not Akasha.    
    
For us, a place where an ant is sitting is not Akasha     
but for a dinosaur that place is Akasha.     
With the advancement of technology     
when we can record even the presence of x-ray     
then it looks theoretically there is no Akasha outside     
because Akasha is full and filled     
by different things and there is no Voidness in Akasha.     
Then comes the time     
when we start seeing inside the object.    
    
Whether wave-particle or planet     
they are made of something.     
If that holds true it gives an opportunity     
for voidness to exist in between the constituents.    
    
But what is that which is not made of anything     
and hence no void inside that.     
That is completely filled     
and this universe is made of that absolute.     
Upanishad discusses this lofty topic in different ways.

# Article5066 : The Concept Of Six Sins    
tags: [ 'Indian Culture', Philosophy]    
    
Science taught us that     
we evolved from unicellular life     
to monkeys and chimpanzees etc and finally humans.     
Our consciousness is a phenomenon     
of chemical reactions in the body.     
So we are nothing but a physical being.     
Physical destroyed, we are finished! Stop! Over!    
    
Religion teaching us morality.     
Kaam (Desire), Krodh (Anger), Mada (self-pride),     
Lobh (Greed), Matsarya( Jealousy) are gates to hell.     
Avoid these, they are the sins.     
Control them. Discipline yourself, learn morality, etc.    
    
But very few challenge science     
by asking whether consciousness is the outcome     
of the physical or physical world     
has come from consciousness.    
    
Quantum physics is trying that     
but still, not many scientists are not open     
to accept that causation is downward,     
i.e. first there is infinite, eternal consciousness     
and then the creation and desolation     
of the world in that consciousness.     
Even physical space is a child of that all-pervading,     
always existing consciousness principle.    
    
And very few ask questions     
to religious people that if all is bad     
then what you are saying is     
your god has put inside     
all these bad in human beings,     
and all are suffering.     
Even innocent animals are not spared by your God.     
In fact, these problems are more in the human than in animals.     
Rarely people challenge this design of god.     
Those who challenge this concept     
they try to become Liberal, scientists, thinkers, etc.    
    
But the fact is humans are like this.     
Either because of past karma     
or because of god or because of the environment.     
So the problem is not kaam, krodh etc.     
It is an integral part of the design     
and the Creator’s design is not faulty.    
    
The problem is limited identity.     
Why don’t we spend money on educating human     
that you are like the way you are.     
This is the perfect outcome of the evolution process.     
So, be endlessly greedy, angry, etc,     
don’t hide this don’t feel upset.    
    
But first understand truly, correctly, and convincingly     
that you are a non-physical being.     
The physical you are holding right now     
is not even equal to a particle of dust     
in this physical visible world.    
    
So behave as if you are nonphysical     
and there is no second non-physical in the entire existence.     
Physical beings are many.    
    
Do whatever best possible     
for this one nonphysical self.     
Go in the world, interact will different physical objects around     
But when it comes to thinking and doing     
then think and do in a most greedy way.     
As if you are serving yourself only,     
There is no second.     
You are the criminal, you are the police     
your the judge and you are the jail.     
You are the earth,     
You are the hell and     
You are a heaven without the second.

Cleaning and alignment of a person     
at the physical, emotional, intellectual, and energy     
to the surrounding and cosmos in large     
is utmost important for happy living     
and well being of an individual.    
    
For that purpose, we do various kinds of activities     
like bathing, prayers, social work, preaching, study, etc.     
But ultimately it is for the self only.    
    
How foolish it is to think that     
I am bathing so that others do not smell bad in me,     
I am doing social service for the sake of society,     
I am doing prayer for the sake of God and the well-being of others,     
I am doing a study to make my student successful.    
    
We should be thankful for the cosmos     
that it has given me so many     
opportunities and methods to clean ourselves.    
    
These different methods are called     
Gyan yoga, Bhakti yoga, Karma yoga, Ashtanga yoga etc.     
Depending on the level you are cleaning yourself.    
    
But the ignorant mind will always be convinced that     
I am doing so much for my children, society,     
company, family, nation and     
they cannot pay me back for my hard work and austerity.

# Article5068 : The Purpose Of Motions    
tags: [ Concepts, Philosophy]    
    
As per the law of physics all the planets, stars and galaxies    
want to go in a straight line    
but it is a gravitational force due to which they start rotating.    
But they are not aware that they are rotating. Are they?    
For humans also the same thing applies.    
But, human knows, he is in a circle    
and it is not possible to break the circle.    
Therefore instead of looking at purpose in a straight line    
he looks at the purpose in a circular motion.    
This circular motion is created    
by another kind of gravitational force in life,    
you can call it love, greed, attachment, attraction, desire, etc.    
Ancient scripture throws upon us an idea of Liberation, Moksha.    
It means freedom from the eternal endless circle.    
But, what does that mean?    
Going infinitely in a straight line like planets can go without gravity?    
Or not going anywhere?    
Or be everywhere?    
Or completely destroy and be one with the cosmos?    
Ignorantly many people think that is another kind of joy!

# Article5069 : The Root Of Body Mass    
tags: [ Concepts, Philosophy, Science]    
    
    
All lives including humans are made of proteins.     
Protein is made of molecules.     
A molecule is made of atoms.     
Atom is made of 3 kinds of particles     
namely electron, proton, and neutron     
Entire existence is made of these     
3 fundamental particles and forces and nothing else.    
    
Atom is 99% empty and 1% of space is     
occupied by proton and neutron.     
Almost 100% mass of an atom is     
because of proton and neutron.    
    
So 100% mass resides in 1% space.     
99% free space of an atom has no mass.    
    
Gravity does not have any effect on proton and neutron.     
So proton and neutron do not acquire weight.    
    
A person of 10 kg mass looks 98 kg m/s2 weight because of the earth’s gravity.    
    
A person which is made of 99% space looks very 100% solid.     
And sometimes people think they are rock solid.    
    
How the hell humans behave with such a solid attitude?     
It looks like people do not understand even high school physics till they die.    
    
As per well known E=MC^2 equation.     
A person of 10 kg mass will have 9×10^65 joule energy.     
After death not even one micro-gram weight reduce     
so the same energy must remain in the body.    
    
Who is that mass-less, nonphysical,     
which drive this much energy of the body     
and absence of which is called the death of a person.     
Is that nonphysical in you and me different?    
    
Don’t be in a hurry to reply.     
On Sunday before you go for a mass meeting or another social meeting.     
Think who am I, who moves the energy and mass of the body.    
    
Religious people declare saint to one-time miracle doer     
I am looking for that miracle doer,     
who is creating mass at every moment,     
in the protons and neutrons of the atoms of my body.    
    
Because, if proton and neutron doesn’t     
have mass then this entire universe     
will be mass-less, hence weight-less, and finally non-existent!

# Article5070 : What Kind Of Education?    
tags: [ Education]    
    
Religious education teaches you     
relative morality, rituals, and traditions.     
It forces you to believe     
in the knowledge of books as “the” truth     
and your traditions are “the” most useful, practical     
and others’ are just childish or outdated.    
    
Currently prevailed secular education     
teaches us how to extract     
the maximum joy from the resource,     
people, nature, and systems around us.     
The teaching is so focused on the extraction     
that student misses many important lessons     
but remember just one.    
    
We need to ask ourselves,     
if we could have understood     
physics, chemistry, and maths     
of the high school properly     
then would we have lived the way we are living?    
    
What is that education system     
which can metamorphoses     
a natural, selfish, greedy, egoistic,     
lusty, jealous, angry animal-human to divinely human?    
    
In the age of sophisticated weapons     
killing Ravan is very easy.     
Identifying, locating, and making him convinced     
that he is Ravan is extremely difficult.

# Article5071 : Empty Space Is Created Of What?    
tags: [ Concepts, Philosophy, Science]    
    
To see the objects, places, and events     
we keep running in the world from one place to another.     
After reaching the place     
or having thing around     
we rotate 360 degrees around,     
up and down the object or the place,     
if possible break and peep inside and     
this is the way to know the world around you.     
It gives joy to humans. It is the human way.    
    
Open space around you or in the sky     
is not empty, neither we can that it is not made     
We neither can say it is made of nothing    
    
Sit calmly in some open place.     
See at 3 feet distance in the air or open space.     
Mark one cubic inch space in the open space before you.     
Without seeing anything just that space.    
    
Virtually mark that area as airtight and     
assume there is no air and no other particle in that area.     
Only light and radiations present there.     
Now just see the light and space     
in that area and nothing else.    
    
Do you think to know this area     
you need to rotate yourself 360 degrees,     
up down around this area?     
Of course not! You will say.    
    
Think what is that of which     
this empty space and light are made of.     
If you see this space for 5 minute     
then think is space same     
which did you see 5 min before?    
    
Space before you has 3 dimensions,     
I am not talking about 3 dimensions of an object,     
I am talking about 3 dimensions of empty space.     
from where those 3 dimensions come?    
    
Is there any other dimension     
in that cubic inch space     
from which 3-dimensional space has taken birth?     
It is possible that there are billions of other life existing     
in that 1 cubic inch space that you marked airtight?    
    
Do not say you aren’t able to see the light and space     
without seeing the objects around.     
To penetrate the space     
you need a sharper tool than space itself.     
To see the photon of light     
you need different light than     
the light which shows the objects around.    
    
Without being philosopher     
Think, which mind can see the creator of the space and     
the content of the Light which reveals the world around?

# Article5072 : Product Focus Vs Process Focus    
tags: [ 'Bhagwat Gita', Concepts, 'Indian Culture', Philosophy]    
    
## Jugaad vs Karmanye Vadhikaraste    
    
Teaching philosophy is one thing living is another.    
    
“Karmanye Vadhikaraste”.     
Means you have control over karma, your process.     
So guide and control the process.    
    
“Adhikaraste MaFaleshu Kadachna”.     
Doesn’t mean without expecting a result.     
Nor does it mean result for someone else     
or work for society or higher cause etc.    
    
It simply means the output of the process     
cannot be controlled directly.     
So don’t waste your time     
sitting at the other end of the process tunnel     
and expect results as per your wish.     
Do whatever you can do at the process part,     
if the process is rightly designed     
keeping output in the mind     
then the output of the process     
will ultimately happen the way the process designed.    
    
This simple philosophy is     
told thousands of years back in the war field.     
We teach it every day.     
But only the Japanese could live this in the true sense.    
    
We Indian preach this     
but we bypass all processes and want the best results.     
Years over years people are talking     
debating discussing, preaching     
but where do you find the sign of implementation?    
    
There is another philosophy of getting things done, Jugaad.     
The Jugaad concept says work should get done by any means.     
“Karmane” concept leads you to perfection in the process.    
    
In the “Karmane” concept, if a good product is the output of a bad process.     
then you give away that product     
because luck produced that     
and it belongs to anybody but to me.    
    
If you start accumulating things given by luck     
then you also need to cry on things     
thrown upon you by bad luck.     
So better avoid or give away the fruits of luck.    
    
Jugaad concept wants results in the short run.     
The Karmane concept focuses on life long work.     
Neither present can be ignored nor future.     
If too much Jugaad in life then very soon     
when the future becomes present you will have many problems.

tags: [ Concepts, Philosophy, Science]    
    
If the color is a characteristic of the objects     
and hence the beauty is part of the object     
then tell me the color of an atom     
which has 6 electrons, 6 protons, and 6 neutrons.     
This is a carbon atom.     
If you think this is black,     
then you missed the basics of high school physics.     
If not then what gives color to the objects made of carbon?    
    
Color is not a characteristic of objects.     
It is a phenomenon that happens when light falls on the object.     
Now, if it is a phenomenon in nature     
then it should be the same for all observers.     
But, we all do not see the same degree of redness of a red flower.     
And the reason for that is, there is a second phenomenon,     
in this reflected light hits our eye lens.    
    
Even if your lens is normal and equally sensitive as your friend’s     
there are chances you may still miss the color.     
Because there are two other phenomena before you perceive color.     
And you know those.    
    
We appreciate the colors in nature but that is the poetry.     
In reality, those colors are nowhere in the existence.     
It is a seamless phenomenon at four-level     
and we perceive the color and write poetry.     
We love and hate color and objects together     
without knowing, it is not an integral part of anything.    
    
With certainty, we can say that     
One liter milk in a container in a dark place     
does not become solid or gas, half-liter or 2 liters in the dark     
You can measure and experience the same liquidity and weight even in darkness.     
But, the color of milk in pitch dark is not white nor it is black.    
    
If the color is the characteristics of the object     
then it should remain with milk,     
like its liquidity and weight,     
no matter where it is kept.     
Color is temporarily acquired by the object     
due to the interaction of an object and light.     
This is a phenomenon.     
As soon as the light is over, color is gone.    
    
Out of four, three process of color perception,     
still happens outside of the object     
That is why they say beauty is in the eye of the beholder and not in the object    
    
Whether nature or painting,     
or photo or people or objects     
In truth, objects cannot be appreciated     
for their colorful beauty     
but the content which creates that color in the presence of light.

On far top-hill either water getting heated

something is burning on the ground and

it is not that easy for you to know that     
what kind of transformation is happening on the hill.    
In one wood is burning and eventually finished     
nothing will be left after some time.    
    
In another water is becoming cloud     
it will come back again in the form of rain.    
Both transformations have their importance and significance.    
     
In one, you need to completely destroy your old and     
in other, you need to give directions     
to the same energy for other higher causes.

## Happy Diwali    
    
Before we emerge ourselves     
in the long celebrations of Deepawali,     
I wanted to share with you one thought.    
    
At every moment of this festival     
we know that today our Rama     
has come back from the forest.     
But, why did Rama went to the forest?     
What great he did there?     
Who went out from Ayodhya and     
who came to Ayodhya are they both the same?     
If not then what was the transformation?    
    
Is Rama like a Bollywood film hero,     
which remind us always happy ending or     
Rama is much deeper than heroism,     
winning and a happy ending?    
    
Do we celebrate Deepawali just because     
we are Sanatani (Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain) and     
Rama was our ancestor or     
there is some more reason for that?    
    
Perhaps Rama of Ayodhya has come back,     
and Bharat and Ayodhya have many reasons to celebrate.     
But see around in evening parties of Deepawali     
who is celebrating Rama’s return and     
how they celebrate that.    
    
Hope Ravana has not compromised     
the occasion and celebrating in an unethical way.     
The day Osama Bin Laden celebrates American independence day     
don’t think it is a good sign for the USA.     
Be watchful in your breath about the celebrator     
and the reason for the celebration.    
    
Finally, my Rama has come back     
but the Rama, which was in me     
is still wandering in the forest,     
when will he come back,     
for what He is waiting?     
On this auspicious occasion     
can you please pray for the return of Rama in me?    
    
I pray that your Rama returns back     
in your heart and mind.    
    
Wish you a very happy and lovely

how to handle an energy body     
which is close to me in terms of     
relationship or business. All are not expert in handling     
all kinds of energy sources and     
it is not possible also.    
    
Therefore organizational (family, social, business)     
hierarchy is used to manage the energy of different people.     
One who is on top of the hierarchy     
doesn’t mean he is most competent     
to handle all energy sources.     
He or she can manage all because of the hierarchy.    
    
If we fail in managing someone     
then neither it means we are bad     
not it means the other person is bad.     
It simply means as an individual     
I failed to manage that source of energy.     
And it is fine. All cannot be like a trained bomb diffuser,     
who can diffuse all kinds of bombs.     
Some just know how to handle candlelight.

# Article5077 : Nothing Becoming Everything    
tags: [ Concepts, 'Indian Culture', Philosophy, Science]    
    
Objects live in the space and     
they need some 3D space in the space     
where an object can fit into.    
    
Minimum space required to place     
One liter of water is .001 cubic meter.     
What is that minimum space     
in which nothing can be placed,     
even a subatomic particle cannot be placed?    
    
10^-105 cubic meter is that space     
in which nothing can live inside.     
Even light or any kind of radiation     
cannot enter in that volume     
because the thickness of light or radiation is too much.    
    
But, if you have 10^103 units of     
that smallest space then the final made-up space     
can hold one liter of water in that space.    
    
Space which cannot hold anything, even not light rays,     
starts holding everything     
even house, city, planet, star, and galaxies.    
    
This is how nothing becomes everything.     
But is that space really nothing?     
Just because we can not put     
anything physical in that smallest space     
it doesn’t become zero or nothing.     
It is near to zero but not zero.    
    
In fact there is nothing zero in the entire existence.     
Either in the matter form or in the energy form     
they may exist with least quantity but they exist.     
Even if something exists in your idea     
it means it exists in the energy form.    
    
With our all physical or technical capability     
if we can measure then     
we never say it is zero or infinite.     
When we fail to count due to limitation then     
only we call it zero or infinite.    
    
Thus zero and Infinity both are concepts     
but in reality, they do not exist.    
    
Any guess who brought these two ideas     
of the two non-existences?

Carefully observe the below multiplication.    
    
Let us say two variables A &amp; B. Initially both are equal to 4.    
    
A*B = 16     
4*4 = 16     
8*2 = 16     
16*1=16     
160*.1=16     
16,000,000,00*.000,000,01=16    
    
**Observation:**     
In the final step, the first part is extraordinarily large.     
But, the second part is extremely small     
but you cannot consider it zero,     
otherwise who result becomes zero.    
    
Neither you can change the last digit     
of smaller part to anything of your choice like 5 or 6 or 1.     
This is what we do generally when things are negligible.     
Generally, we think, how does it matter     
whether it is .00000001 or .00000004     
Both are negligible.    
    
**Moral from this mathematics:**     
Initially, both numbers are equal.     
But one starts becoming bigger by digesting the other,     
so it becomes bigger and bigger by eating     
value of another number.    
    
If the end result is fixed (like rule the masses) then     
the only way to grow is to digest others’     
culture, philosophy, tradition, food etc.    
    
But at the same time     
you keep the smaller alive     
because the moment you completely     
destroy that to zero,     
end result also becomes zero     
no matter how big you are.     
So the survival of the weak is in the interest     
of the ruler and the powerful.    
    
Unfortunately during the life,     
the big will not forget to humiliate     
and showing his value to the small.     
The big don’t realize that     
I am fat because I have digested     
that which was equal to me once upon a time.    
    
This simple math applies to politics,     
religious digestion, cultural digestion,     
human behavior and we think math is a complex subject!    
    
But the mathematics of any kind     
beautifully explains the main idea     
in a single line or in a small formula     
for which others need to write books.    
    
You are free to apply this concept     
to Bharat Rastra existed before 1700AD and of today.

# Article5079 : Happening Human Reasoning    
tags: [ Concepts, Philosophy]    
    
Think about any ten unconnected things.     
Connect them all in a half-page story.     
Any human can do this.     
Children can do it better and faster.    
    
A small patch of white clouds in the sky,     
a crow in the nest, a snake crawling to cross the road,     
a man going to home in his cycle,     
the day is Saturday, time is inauspicious Rahukaal,     
man listening to a lovely old song from FM radio.     
What is the connection between all these?     
Who gave meaning to the time that it is good and bad?    
    
It shows immense imagination power of the mind,     
this kind of mind rests in the human.     
Scientists try to guess some number     
but no one truly knows how much memory a human mind has.     
No one knows the elastic limit of the human mind.     
Elasticity to imagine, dramatize and think.    
    
This capacity gives human an ability     
to create a reason for any happening.     
We debate, argue, and have an immense desire     
to win after convincing others.     
In fact, human consider that the greatest winning     
than other physical war and winning.    
    
Those contemporary minds     
which are able to convince others for something unthinkable     
and show them the path     
to come out of their current problems     
they are called the prophet, lord, son of god, gods, avatar, and leaders.    
    
People say everything happening around us     
because of some existing cause.     
If we are not able to establish a cause     
then some say it is by chance.     
But some others say if we are not able to find the reason     
then it means the reason is too complex and deeper.     
And nothing happens by chance.    
    
Every death has a cause.     
But there are some who suspect everything.     
They say the cause of death is murder.     
And the cause of the murder is something else     
and reasoning keep going endlessly.     
One day they can prove also that     
death is not natural but a murder.     
After all who knows the fact?     
Even a person may have died without knowing!    
    
The “murder” is equivalent to “cause”.     
They try to reason out everything.     
Why human looks so helpless     
when s/he feel something happened     
but the cause is beyond the apprehension     
of any living intelligent being?    
    
Human reasoning is fine     
because it’s part of human design     
but can’t things simply happen without any reason?    
    
Some human are so convinced that     
even leaf fall from the tree because of God’s wish or     
wind’s force, or gravity etc.     
Cannot human come to term with nature and     
surrounding and say it happened because the time has come.    
    
When the time comes to happen something     
It will happen and people can build the reasons     
to convince himself or others.     
Can’t we agree that time is the only reason     
and all other reasons are the creation of human intellect?    
    
We find joy in reasoning.     
But, does reason really matters and important in nature?     
The human mind will always say yes.     
That is why he is able to discover     
so many mysteries of nature,     
travel in space, go to mars and the moon.     
Create laws, rules, systems, and processes     
to manage the surrounding in a better and predictable way.    
    
But there is something in existence     
that fails every human reasoning.     
When that power wants it will happen     
and human is like a helpless small insect     
in front of that unseen, unseeable but humongous power    
    
You can call it whatever you want.     
You can attach whatever shape,     
color, personality, emotions     
you want to attach this.    
    
But, think and reason it out     
how can you influence this mammoth     
one power of the whole existence?    
    
Your morality, meditation, prayer,     
community work, social service     
All is either for yourself, your family,     
your society or your nation.    
    
That power, which governs the existence     
is not even aware of that     
in this infinitely vast cosmos     
Some kind of insect calls himself human     
in some part of this multiverse looking for my favor!

When a human kills,    
cooks and eats helpless creature    
and no God, Allah, Devi, Devta, Jesus    
come to help that helpless creature    
then how come this intelligent human being    
think that when s/he is being exploited,    
cheated, molested, robbed, deceived,    
grilled and cooked by other people    
or nature or religion, culture, government around    
then god will come to protect him?    
    
How come s/he thinks that God will deliver justice to him/her?    
How come God will come to protect only humans and not animals?    
    
Just because the human has created religion,    
holy books can write poetry to fool    
God and sing His glory?    
Do you think your God is so dumb, idiot, irrational    
which can be tricked by humans,    
And gives justice only to human beings?    
    
The rationale of this kind of logic    
lies in those religions who think    
humans are a special creation of God,    
humans are the highest and center of creation,    
creation is done for the human    
so that human can enjoy,    
the only human has a soul and others not.    
    
Unfortunately this kind of logic also    
sipped by Sanatana Dharma people    
and they also became illogical in this aspect of thinking.    
The height of illogic is when a human says    
this animal is Kurbani, offering to god, Devi, Devta, Allah.    
After that, it is Halal or Prasad.    
    
Either don’t believe in God or believe    
He/She is for the entire creation.    
O Pratibimba, it looks like a human will never come out    
of this kind of hypocritical living and irrational thinking!    
Because humans rationalize what they like and do.    
They don’t do and like what is rational!    
So rational mind is used for irrational act.

tags: [ Concepts, 'Indian Culture', Philosophy, Poetry]    
    
Either by choice or by chance you are in a profession     
which you feel pride in or makes your living from.     
Some are saints, some are robbers and thieves,     
Some are scientists or doctors or engineers     
or teachers or politicians or preachers     
or terrorist or activist or evangelist and millions of others.    
    
There are two kinds of fights     
within the professions & between the professions.     
Fight within the profession helps improving an existing profession.     
The fight between the professions wants to demolish other professions.    
    
It is foolish to think that one day     
there will be permanent peace in this world.     
Peace can never be permanent.     
DevAsura Sangram is a concept of the eternal fight in Sanatana dharma.    
    
Every profession has some role to play in this fight.     
The only question is the ratio of professionals within the ecosystem.    
    
100% terrorist or 100% saints,     
or one bad for every good,     
or one doctor for every patient,     
or one teacher for every learner, etc.     
All of these are ideal situations.    
    
But 100% saint or good is the ideal human striving for.     
All the time humans struggle to reduce the strength     
and population of terrorists or bad is a fight to reestablish     
the equilibrium and not to break the same.    
    
What you say negative forces, they can never become zero.     
1% is reasonable or .001% is reasonable that can be debated.     
In fact, this increasing % of terrorists or bad     
beyond some tolerance limit of any society     
gives rise to the concept of     
re-establishment of dharma and the need for Avatar.    
    
Do you think the time has come     
to re-establish Dharma in     
your profession, Society, or personal life?     
Do you think Rama within will reincarnate     
and fight back to establish that Dharma?

If you live near a river or ocean

Rain, ice, food, plant all have their source in water.    
    
If you live near the north or the south pole of the earth     
then ice is everything for you.     
Everything is made of ice.     
Water, vapor, cloud, life around all have sources in ice.

If you are a secular person living near a river or ocean     
then you will say, why are we all fighting?     
all are the same, all is water!

Mass is the condensation of energy.     
What looks solid is because of two reasons.     
The first is the design of our brain,     
what is solid for us not solid for all other lives,     
what is liquid for us not liquid for all other lives.    
    
The second is too much energy condensed in one place.     
You take anything wood or stone or glass     
the same principle applies to existence.    
    
Weight is because of gravity and mass.     
And Mass is because of energy.    
    
Finally, mass is an illusion created by energy.     
But this illusion looks true     
in our day to day experiences.    
    
This is called Maya.     
That which is there but not there really.

All Sciences, particle physics, and quantum physics     
in particular, tells us some truth of this cosmos.     
But they also tell us,     
it is too complex to understand     
but we are still trying     
with thousands of brilliant minds and     
hundreds of supercomputers, internet, AI and     
investment of many billion dollars.    
    
Spiritual, philosophical, and “darshan” texts     
(not religious or historical texts)     
also tells us some truth of the cosmos.    
    
Scientists are still trying     
to understand and explain.     
Do you think the work of Rishis,     
philosophers is over?    
    
They tried to explain their subjective truth     
using entertaining stories and     
finally said language is the biggest barrier,     
so experience it on your own.    
    
Now when people go for an experience     
they do not have anything else     
other than the characters of those stories.    
    
As long characters are working     
so long is good but,     
when people have problems and     
story characters are not able     
to solve their problems     
they say all stories are mythological     
there is no truth and no help available.    
    
But Rishi knew that     
characters are created by them     
to explain which is not easy to understand.     
So what are we telling now?     
We are wiser and     
we have figured out     
which those Rishis couldn’t figure out?    
    
Finally, where are Rishis of 21st century     
who are trying to experience, understand and     
explain this subjective truth.    
    
It looks surrounding is full of     
entertaining storytellers     
who are repeating the same old stories?    
    
It has some significance but     
today’s generation is interested     
in something which is more than stories but     
they don’t have more time     
than 5 seconds to read 140 characters.    
    
Finally, there are very few serious workers and     
taker of truth rest and is     
fame, awards, recognition, designation,     
marketing, sales, investment, and profits.    
    
Do you think, you need to take forward     
the torch, which was given to us by our Rishis?     
Are you on the path of Rishis?

tags: [ Death, Life, Philosophy, Poetry, Vedanta]    
    
Helplessly we take birth in some family,     
without our desire and control.     
Helplessly we die someday     
without our desire and against our wish.    
    
Human is not certain about     
incoming of next breath     
think constructing his building     
which can last for many hundred years!    
    
O Man, you do not have time     
to live the present     
but want to protect the unseen future!    
    
O Man, you do not believe     
in the certainty of the relationship     
and investing your life in building fragile things!    
    
Man who struggle in youth     
In search of love, happiness, shelter, job     
Thinks old age will be peaceful     
because there are insurance companies     
and children to take care of.    
    
To make these relationships more reliable     
we try to bring strong laws for insurers     
and high morality for humans.     
But even after that who can deny the suffering?    
    
If there is enjoyment     
then it is because someone is suffering.     
Or in a state of helplessness     
Human has learned to be happy at the suffering of others?    
    
Do you see a system or hope for a system     
where all have joy and well-being?    
    
In old age, people have a lot of diseases.     
In youths, people have a lot many health complications.     
Those who have money,     
make the hospital their permanent home.    
    
Sometimes in comma and     
sometimes in a semi-consciousness state     
Hoping to go home again     
live there in a good healthy state for ever.    
    
Life has become so much important     
That the word death is considered inauspicious     
People are investing in learning the art of living     
Even when they know birth happens only once     
And death is happening every moment,     
Thus, society think death is so much ugly, inauspicious     
and birth is beautiful!    
    
I remember in the olden time     
People use to go to Gaya or Kashi     
towards the end of their life     
And willing work to detach from the body     
And candidly one day choose not to enter the body     
Where that science has gone?    
    
Suicide is a state of helplessness     
Like birth and death is helplessness.    
    
But, if human learn the art of dying     
Then he automatically learns     
how to live meaningful every moment     
And how to exit gracefully and willingly,     
when there is a desire to change body     
and continue living in the new body.    
    
In this state of wisdom     
human knows there is     
no exit from the suffering created by Karma     
but there is an exit from the pain of worn and torn body.    
    
I have not met anybody     
who is happy with his/her body     
Some say I am too short, some I am too tall     
Some say my skin is too black, some it is too white     
Some say I am too fat, some say I am too thin     
Some say I have a heart problem, so say I have a bone problem     
Some say I have a gastric problem, some say I have BP problem.    
    
But if you tell them to leave this body to get the new     
They say, all your Gods, faith, Pooja, worship is non-sense.     
Don’t trick me, I have been fooled enough in this world.     
I will not leave this till get a new, better, fresh body for me.     
So we want to live again without dying in the first.    
    
O Wise one,     
You even don’t believe in your God?     
Or you are not convinced with your Karma of this life?     
Or you are an atheist?     
That is why you want a better body first     
Without exiting this one?    
    
But your God is smarter than you     
He thinks if He gives you a new body first     
Then there are chances you wanted     
to enjoy the wealth of the old body and     
disease-less perfect fresh new body     
and not willing to leave both!

Christianity has focused their     
more energy in the Karma aspect.     
So they created many missionaries,     
uplifted the education, and health of their people.     
How did they do? whom they benefited?     
why they did etc, all will become     
too much complicated and political     
so avoiding in this article.     
But the truth is their Karma brought     
some physical comfort to individual human beings.    
    
Islam focused on Bhakti more.     
They taught Kuran in Madarsas to all their followers.     
So the output is believers.     
What did they teach? What did people understand?     
Why did followers fail to understand?     
What is the impact of that     
again that is a topic of big debate.    
    
Hinduism got mixed up and     
remain unfocused with all these aspects.     
Organizations like Ramakrishna Mission focused on Karma,     
Organizations like Patanjali Yoga Peetha on Swadeshi and business,     
Organizations like Sringeri Matham on Philosophy and Darshan,     
Organizations like ISKCON and many others on Devotion, Bhakti.    
    
Hence when it comes to infrastructure,     
Like created by churches, Hindus are nowhere.     
When it comes to believers,     
fortunately, Hindus couldn’t create hardcore believers as well.     
They try to apply their mind     
and even do trading and negotiation with God.     
What is in it for me if I give my ten rupees to god?    
    
When it comes to philosophy     
Hinduism has given many philosophers     
of the highest order to the world.     
It may be different that     
not many people around today     
but still situation is not that bad.    
    
Now if we blame that poor Dalit or backward class     
getting converted into other religions     
then it is not because of Hindu philosophy     
or too much torture on low caste people.     
Even high class but poor people also getting converted.     
And suffering is across the Jati and Varna of the entire Hindu system.    
    
It is because our focus was not     
building infrastructure to serve.     
Everything is fine, but for some time     
if we reduce preaching philosophies     
and performing Katha Keertan     
and focus that energy on creating     
infrastructure then this conversion problem     
and politics can be addressed.    
    
Do you think this right path for Hindus?     
Do you think there are people     
who can understand this gap and     
channelize their energy     
to build the community in this way?     
Do you think that those who have money and network power     
will use that for this purpose?    
    
Finally, the government should not be     
controlling temples in the secular state and     
there must strict guidelines for temples     
so that they use their funds     
for community and infrastructure     
building and not in corruption and self-serving.

# Article5086 : Who Is Really Sleeping?    
tags: [ 'Bhagwat Gita', Concepts, Philosophy, Poetry]    
    
Waking to one who is sleeping is easy.     
Waking to one who is awake is difficult.     
Waking to one, who is fully awake in his dreams     
and thinking that the absolute truth is this     
what I am experiencing, is most difficult.    
    
People can have this kind of dream     
even when they are physically     
running behind something.    
    
Melting frozen water is easy     
Freezing oxygen is very difficult     
But unfreezing a frozen mind is extremely difficult.    
    
Why a mind get frozen?     
Because of ‘Tamas’, inertia,     
laziness, living in a dead-end for a long,     
feeling comfortable in life,     
easy money, undisciplined lifestyle,     
free flow living, madly looking for permanency in life,     
not able to appreciate or respect others point of view,     
not getting for which you are working hard for a long time,     
consuming toxins that your body cannot handle, feeling worthless.     
are few causes of freezing mind.    
    
But, it is the responsibility of friends,     
who are more wake to perceive the truth,     
to wake and inspire others     
to see beyond the horizon     
and see which cannot be seen     
when one is drunk with the toxin of     
power, money, name, fame, luxury,     
comfort and arrogance or too busy are serving self.    
    
O Pratibimba, if you know     
you are fully awake for the absolute reality     
then can you wake up your dearest?

# Article5087 : Who Killed Tantra    
tags: [ 'Indian Culture']    
    
Tantra means system. (like Lok-Tantra, Praja-Tantra etc)     
Mantra means sound which contains secret, powerful energy.     
Yantra means tool.    
    
Indian Tantra school     
(a school that uses a system or collection of systems)     
helps in creating tools (Yantra).     
This yantra may be of Devi (female),     
Devta (female) yantra.     
Theoretically, I believe it is possible     
to create neutral Yantra as well.    
    
But the purpose is     
to use tool for some genuine     
good purpose and solve complex problems.    
    
You do not use JCB crane to lift a pen.     
Without a tool, you can lift that using your hand.    
    
Neither the purpose is     
to keep praising, cleaning, or sharpening     
or offering flowers to Yantra.     
Yantra (Tool) is meant to achieve some goal.    
    
Being a subjective Yantra     
you need to maintain a personal     
and emotional relationship with the Yantra     
that is why daily Pooja etc     
is necessary but that is not the goal.     
Not surrendering to Yantra is the goal.     
And logically this act cannot give     
you any results as well.    
    
Tantra or Systems primarily come     
from Shaivites, Vaishnavites, and Shakta schools.    
    
I fail to understand     
why this beautiful science is killed     
systematic in the last 100 years     
and we have moved into western systems of one God,     
many gods, mass prayer, mass meditation, mass service etc.     
These may be good political tools to unite     
the people and rule the nation     
but definitely not what our ancestors have given to us.    
    
Political responses to public Namaz, Sunday masses     
can we Public Ramlila, Public Hanuman Chalisa etc.     
But this is not our original system,     
This is the response to political threats.    
    
The most unfortunate part of this is,     
many who claim to know this science     
are either fraud or ill minded people.     
On top of that western-educated     
media reporters, editors, debaters,     
and commentators bring it further down.    
    
In the public domain science means physical sciences     
but what about these sciences     
which has been part of culture and traditions?    
    
Without all this what god or goddess     
we are praying and to whom we are fooling     
by following western traditions?    
    
Are we trapped in politics?     
Are we trapped in race and competition with westerners?     
Have we become mindless     
who is not able to understand what is happening around us?     
Or we are so naive that anybody can fool us?

# Article5088 : About Indian Secularism    
tags: [ Concepts, 'Indian Culture']    
    
I was thinking, as a society and as an individual     
how low we will go in our thinking?    
    
Although I couldn’t define     
Indian secularism correctly     
yet I have found some signs of Indian secularism.     
If you want to add then feel free     
to write in the comment section    
    
- English is a secular language and all Indian languages are communal. Samskrut is the greatest communal and non-utility language.    
- Convent education is secular but Gurukul is communal education.    
- Mahatma Gandhi is secular but Hey Raam is communal.    
- Good Morning is secular but Namaste is communal.    
- Hi is secular and Raam-Raam Ji is communal.    
- Rajiv Gandhi is secular but Narendra Modi is communal.    
- Congress is secular and BJP is communal.    
- PT, exercise is secular and yoga is communal.    
- Twinkles twinkle song is secular and Asatoma Sadgamhmya is communal.    
- Hollywood and Bollywood songs are secular but Devotional songs are communal.    
- Being secular songs, English and Bollywood songs, can be played and enjoyed at any time and at any place but there is fix time and place for the devotional songs.    
- Pant, short, shirt, and tie is a secular dress and Kurta Dhoti is communal old fashion.    
- The constitution is secular but the concept of duty – dharma, is communal    
- English names are secular and Indian names are communal.    
- Hindu Temple is communal places and other prayer places of the mass gathering are secular.    
- Going to a picnic is secular and going to “Teerth Yatra” is communal and for old age Hindu people.    
    
## **Extended Logic of Communalism**     
    
- Philosophy is secular but Vedanta is Hindu, and Hindu is communal so Vedanta is influenced by communal ideas.    
- Cold drink, alcohol is secular but cow milk is children’s drink and only Hindu has madness for that animal, and Hindu is communal so cow milk is forbidden product for secular.    
- Having a fireplace at home is secular but having Deepak or Havan Kund is communal.    
- A formless God is universal and secular but a God with form is a sign of medieval, illiterate, uneducated communal Hinduism.    
- Roti is Indian but bread is international.    
- Continental food, Chinese, Italian food is international and Indian food is oily, unhealthy.    
- Going to international picnic spots is a sign of richness and pride but going to Indian villages, mountains, and forest is a sign of poverty.    
    
So mathematically it looks Hinduism = Communal = Backward = Anti Dalit = Anti Human Rights = Blasphemous = Anti Science = Poverty = Uneducated = Helpless &amp; Beggar = Conservative = Bhajan Keertan    
    
Secularism = Anything other than Hinduism = Forward Thinking = Scientific Mind = Human Rights = Richness = Highly Educated = Powerful & Charity Giver = Liberal = Big Public Parties    
    
The above equations are hugely messed up!    
    
Whatever good you can see in Hindu society that is secular     
and whatever bad you see that is Hindu communal.     
I am not pointing a finger at any other religion     
but our own so-called educated, English educated,     
so-called scientific and creative mind journalists,     
poets, artists, authors, columnists etc     
are a party of this thought process.     
Now when there is darkness under a big lamp     
and the lamp doesn’t recognize this then what to do?    
    
On top of that our over-enthusiastic people     
claim so many things in the name of Hinduism     
which is difficult to prove     
and it puts others in a defensive position.    
    
Not sure, in what bottomless pit we are falling?     
Without applying mind, if we keep doing this     
then there is no hope as well.

# Article5089 : Suffering And Remedy    
tags: [ Concepts, Mindfulness, Philosophy]    
    
If you know the cause of all your pain and suffering     
is ignorance of the subject from you are suffering     
then yoga of Gyana is for you.     
This can lead you to happiness.    
    
If you think the cause of suffering is your laziness     
then Karma is the solution     
otherwise more Karma will bring     
more pain and suffering to you.    
    
If you think the cause of suffering     
is Shraddha, faith, devotion then Bhakti is the solution     
otherwise, with Bhakti you can suffer as well.    
    
If you think the cause of suffering is body pain     
then Hatha Yoga is the solution     
otherwise, Hatha Yoga will suck your time     
and you still remain miserable.    
    
If you think the cause of your suffering is flickering mind     
then meditation is the solution     
else more meditation can make you tired.    
    
The mute point is this,     
everything is not for everyone     
Know the cause of suffering     
and adopt the solution as per the problem.    
    
Is there any life in the world     
which is not suffering from at least one of these?    
    
O Pratibimba, can a suffering mind     
clearly, know the real cause of suffering?

# Article5090 : Paradox Of Learning    
tags: [ Education, Mind]    
    
If you listen to some idea with an empty mind,     
no previous knowledge or     
setting aside your previous knowledge,     
then either in reality or pretentious way     
you are accepting there is no existing neuron     
in your brain which has any information     
related to the idea being spoken.    
    
In that state listening becomes a boring process,     
you get tired, sleepy, restless and     
you want to leave the learning setup.    
    
If you listen and try to relate the subject     
with some other related or     
unrelated known experiences     
then learning is biased by     
your existing knowledge.    
    
In this situation,     
you have questions ready without     
analyzing the answer from the speaker     
from all different angles.     
Hence, you are not able to listen     
what is being said but listening     
which justifies the existing experience.    
    
It looks it is almost impossible     
to listen with an empty mind.     
Especially a subject where you have spent     
your whole life and you ‘think’     
you know it thoroughly.    
    
Probably this is the reason old,     
experienced, people/experts say that     
with this huge experience     
now I understand how little I know.    
    
Do you think “listening with an open mind”     
is a paradoxical statement?

# Article5091 : Moksha The God In Vedanta    
tags: [ 'Indian Culture', Moksha, Philosophy, Vedanta, Maya]    
    
The God of Upanishad is not that     
what we “speak about” but the speaker!    
    
Not that which eye can see     
but through which eyes see.    
    
Not that which you pray     
but that in the absence of which     
you cannot pray.    
    
The word “Maya” of Vedanta doesn’t     
mean illusion nor it means it is false.    
    
It means, it is not the way you know,     
experience and see. It is different.    
    
If you want to know the absolute existence, “Satya”     
without Maya then take a step back     
and see everything including     
your mind and body as an object.    
    
Moksha of Vedanta is not received     
from your Bhakti or Karma     
nor it is given by God.     
It is about dropping off     
your notion that you are bound.     
But how that is possible?    
    
If some devil has bounded you     
in the shackles and then disappear     
then some god is required to free you up.    
    
But if you yourself have purchased shackles,     
tightly bounded yourself and then crying for Moksha     
then even if you god come to help you     
you will not be free,     
because you will not handover him     
the key through which you have bound yourself.     
On top of that testing God and waiting for his miracle,     
To free you up without your handover the key of the lock.    
    
Even if some miracle makes you free     
Will you live like a Mukta Jeeva?     
Impossible! because human love to create     
walls for himself and then cry for help and freedom

# Article5092 : Four Ways Or One Way    
tags: [ 'Bhagwat Gita', Dharma, Moksha, Philosophy]    
    
Generally, people think,     
Bhakti Yoga, Karma Yoga,     
Raj Yoga, Gyana Yoga     
are the four parallel paths in life,     
which leads to the same goal.     
Hence, they think to walk on any road,     
and we will reach the same place.    
    
If you like road analogy     
then know it as only one road,     
which you travel with four kinds of wealth.     
Every moment, every day, and phase of life     
based on the need you use     
different wealth and keep moving.    
    
Without Shraddha and Bhakti,     
you cannot commit yourself for travel.    
    
Without Karma Shakti,     
you cannot walk even a foot on this road.    
    
Without Raj Yoga, your body and mind     
will become weak during the journey and     
you can fall early in the journey.    
    
Without Gnyana Shakti     
you will not know, why to travel?     
where am I going? who is traveling?     
how long I should go?     
shall I stop and just watch the surrounding?     
what shall I do? What do I want to achieve?    
    
With Gnyana Shakti     
you know that this is not a journey of “me”     
because I am Sat-Chit-Anand.     
Omnipresent, all through existing.    
    
There is nothing to know here     
but everything to experience     
whether I am here or there or nowhere.

# Article5093 : Who Is The Knower Of Brahman?    
tags: [ 'Bhagwat Gita', Concepts, 'Indian Culture', Philosophy]    
    
Don’t make the mistake of thinking that     
Brahma Gnyani knows everything,     
he doesn’t eat anything,     
he doesn’t do anything,     
he sits at one place under a tree     
without moving and bless     
to all whoever comes to him.    
    
I do not know how this notion     
has come to Indian society.     
Is this thought planted in us or     
our own self imposed guideline?     
But this is not a sign of a wise society.    
    
What s/he does or doesn’t is her/his choice,     
after all, s/he is Mukta and Gnyani.     
It is foolish to decide and control     
the behavior of Mukta Purusha.     
If you become a judge and start judging this way     
then he will frustrate the judge     
and remain joyful himself.    
    
In the age of the Internet, you need not     
memorize the facts to become Gnyani.     
Otherwise, you will end up becoming Baddha (slave) Gnyani.     
What is the use of knowing all and having all     
but still miserable!    
    
Brahma Gnyani means one who experiences     
his/her existence as eternal and immortal unconditionally!     
Because of this experience s/he remains stable inside.    
    
Because of his/her Sadhana and calm mind,     
he may know the past of everyone (history)     
but he still cannot know the present and future.     
Because by design future is probabilistic     
and anything can happen in probability.    
    
And to know the present     
one needs to experience the moment     
under the cursor of time and     
not thinking of past and present.     
The present is always beyond time.    
    
He still doesn’t know mathematics,     
physics, geology, chemistry, computers, etc.     
If he wants to know he still needs     
to struggle to learn and experiment.    
    
It is foolish to think a Brahma Gnyani     
should not waste his time in physical sciences     
because they are low and learn the only spiritual text.     
This is the reason our modern Gurukul     
remain restricted to the study of philosophy and religion.    
    
What one does, learn or not learn is his choice     
but all he does is in the Mukta Bhava     
and to experience the Moksha     
in all the moments of living in the body.    
    
There are all kinds of people in     
the world of religious, spiritual, and householder.     
Don’t waste your time judging without being a judge.     
Spend time to learn and experience     
that freedom which is your own nature     
and your Dharma.    
    
He still needs food to eat, cloth to wear     
and roof to arrange his life.     
But everyone needs all this     
how to identify Brahma Gnyani?    
    
Don’t break your head in knowing that     
who is Brahma Gnyani and who not.    
    
Spend time to know, understand,     
and experience that how come     
you immortal Atman take birth,     
will die and bounded by Samsara.     
This effort will help you remaining     
blissed out and not judging the other.    
    
O Pratibima, for this, you learn from     
whatever source it is possible.     
Friend or foe, nature or teacher,     
Known or unknown, liked or disliked.     
If you remain conscious and wise     
then this journey is a real journey of     
Azadi/ Freedom/ Moksha/ Liberation,     
rest all is politics and game.

# Article5094 : The Meaning Of Namaste    
tags: [ Concepts, 'Indian Culture', Philosophy]    
    
“नम्” धातु + ङे प्रत्यय = नम:+ते= नमस्ते     
नम् means bow down     
ते means to you or for you    
    
Why should I bow down to you?     
Because you are senior to me?     
Elder to me? More knowledgeable than me?     
Higher in Ashrma to me?     
Wealthier than me?     
Powerful than me?”    
    
What if I don’t bow down to you?     
you will not favor me?     
you will not bless me?     
you will not give me what I want?     
you will not give me which is rightfully mine?     
you will take away from me which I have?     
you can become angry with me?     
you will not love me?     
you will not respect me?    
    
In a worldly sense the meaning and intent     
of Namaste is summarized as above.     
So people do Namaste because of the reasons mentioned above.    
    
In a worldly sense, it is a duty, ritual, karma     
which you do to please or     
break ice to establish the communication.    
    
**But, in spiritual communication it means**     
I bow down to you because     
Through my bodily existence     
I have realized the same reality in your bodily existence.    
    
I live in this body and you live in that body     
But, I am living more consciously     
so I could notice your body around me     
and then one universal reality in your body     
so I say Namaste before you say to me.    
    
You could not have said it     
Because either you are too much busy to notice my presence or     
Too full in your mind to understand     
and identify that one universal oneness.    
    
Or do not care about my presence     
or too much full to feel that your body     
has more power and money possession than I have.    
    
Or looking for an opportunity to punish me     
or too much engrossed in Samadhi     
that you did’t experience any world around     
but only one pure consciousness and     
in that state of wisdom the action, actioner     
and actionee all are one in your experience.

# Article5095 : Eyes On The Ground    
tags: [ Philosophy, Poetry]    
    
Whether I walk, jog or run     
If I have continuous eyes on the ground     
I will not fall because of environmental reasons.    
    
I may still fall but the cause will be     
either my weak limbs or my foolishness.     
But I am happy with this,     
because I am in control     
and I know my happiness     
and miseries are 100% my doing.    
    
If I keep eyes on the ground     
then I will be able to travel     
long with least tiredness     
because there is no competition     
and I am not walking by seeing others.    
    
If I keep my eyes on the ground     
then no drain out of energy in jealousy     
or a sense of achievement that     
I have done it first, faster, and better.    
    
If I keep eyes on the ground     
then no one can irritate me,     
because I do not know that     
others are traveling with me.     
I am lonely enjoying the journey     
without a need of showing off,     
proving, becoming first.    
    
If I keep eyes on the ground     
then I will not hurt those     
who is on the ground?    
    
If I keep eyes on the ground     
then I may miss the destination     
but the journey will be joyful.    
    
Reaching or not reaching the destination     
is not 100% in my control.     
Therefore, if I keep eyes on the destination     
then the journey is also going to be     
full of anxieties and worries.    
    
Yes, journey and destination both are important.     
Yes, life and goal in life both are important.     
Therefore, sometimes for better tomorrow     
we sacrifice today and some people say     
it is a wise way of living.    
    
Other times we do not want to let     
the current moment go.     
For the unseen but promising future     
why should we lose the moment in our hands     
So let us live the fullest in the present     
and this is also a wise way.    
    
But whatever we do,     
keeping eyes on the ground helps to live the moment.     
Even to fly I need to be in touch with the ground.    
    
O Pratibimba, wise people say strike a balance between     
present and future, journey and goal     
ground and sky, near and far     
going to the extreme will cause you pain and suffering.     
But knowing this “balance” is not easy.     
What do you say Pratibimba?

# Article5097 : Greetings For New Year 2020    
tags: [ 'Annual Wishes']    
    
English being the dominating language of the world     
has created the hegemony over all other calendars of the world     
and became the baseline calendar of the business world.     
So on the 1-Jan of every year     
The year will change in all the computers in the world!    
    
English New year starts on 1-Jan     
Jews New Starts around 18 Sep     
Jain New Starts Next day of Diwali (Oct)     
The Parasi New Year (Navroz) starts around 17-Aug.     
Buddhist New Year depends on the country     
(different for China, Japanese, Thailand etc)    
    
Islamic Hijri Calendar starts around 30-Aug. (190 crores)     
Chinese new starts around 25 Jan (approx. 140 crore people)     
Hindu New Starts around Mar (approx. 100 crore people)    
    
First Jan is not the new year of 70% of the world population.    
    
Your new year starts on your birthday     
A national new year starts when we celebrate independence.    
    
Still Happy New Year 2020.    
    
This kind of new years makes sense for 3 kinds of people.     
A. Salespeople – To clear the stock     
B. Those who are looking for any reason to eat, drink, and enjoy. This is just another one.     
C. Those who take resolution once in 365 days and after that forget to follow.     
Serious implementer never waits     
even for Monday or next month     
365 days is too much for them.    
    
May the unseen forces of the cosmos     
Guide you for the next 365 days     
on the path of Dharma and selflessness.     
May that power keeps you motivated     
to achieve greater heights in your life.    
    
May you never become bitter or negative     
at least for the next 365 days.     
May your physical and mental health become more vibrant     
so that you can do whatever you feel is necessary     
for yourself and for the people you love.

# Article5098 : I Hate Reading    
tags: [ Life, 'My Story', 'My Views']    
    
Childhood was over and I was in school     
I need to read books and write exams     
Teachers and parents made it painful for me.     
I hate reading,     
I wanted to quit reading but     
the only solution was to get a job.    
    
I got the job in IT and I have to read more technology books     
than I read in my school &amp; college     
Initially, I enjoyed it but when I realized     
these people are writing more books every day     
than I can read in my whole life.     
I hate reading     
I wanted to quit software development.    
    
I realized management is easy     
one become boss just by reading     
a couple of books and having an MBA degree.     
So, I entered in the management profession     
Life was tougher, there is no end of     
theories, methodologies, frameworks,     
principles, processes, models, bodies of knowledge.     
One has to read all that and apply     
But, for that, you need to read human behavior,     
the behavior of my customers, my team,     
my management and competitors.     
In management, I also have to become responsible     
for the work of my team and     
without reading the human mind it was not possible     
I am a lazy reader and I hate reading    
    
But after reading hundreds of book,     
I wanted to quit management.    
    
People told me to become a religious person,     
You have to read only one book and life will be cool     
Being Hindu I read Bhagwat Gita     
and thought I can settle now     
But to my horrible imagination     
Hinduism has so many religious books     
Which entire management profession do not have     
and on top of that in the Sanskrit language     
I read many books and became tired of reading.     
There was no sense of accomplishment.     
So, I wanted to quit reading.    
    
In 2018 I thought Artificial Intelligence is a new field     
I have to read less here so let me move to AI     
I started my journey in AI     
And to my disappointment     
To understand AI, I have to understand     
everything from my school’s mathematics,     
Everything of my technology career,     
Everything of management     
and Everything of business processes.     
From which I was running away     
Is running behind me.     
On top of that this field is changing so fast     
that it is driving me crazy.    
    
With technology, a change has come,     
I need not read much     
If I can listen, observe, analyze, apply and bring change     
Then I can avoid reading.    
    
I am a lazy reader and     
a person who hates reading     
But, I have to read thousands of books     
on a different subject because of my need     
What is the result?    
    
Now I am realizing that I don’t anything!     
On top of that when I see happy people around     
I feel why to read all this?     
One can be happy even without knowing anything.     
I heard ignorance is bliss!    
    
Then I realized it was not about happiness or bliss of life     
But to swim in the ocean of my own ignorance     
Trying to touch the boundary of infinite ignorance     
Infinity does not have a boundary     
So keep swimming your whole life in this dark ocean.    
    
But after knowing the immensity of my ignorance     
I started feeling, yes this is knowing.    
    
And life is about knowing that ONE     
who knows everything     
even without any struggle.     
Knowing that I am that knower of everything.     
I am that knower who knows about the ignorance     
That knower who is is taking rest     
in the physical body, social body, and cosmic body     
That knower which is traveling     
in the dark ignorance of all the bodies.     
And that knower who will exit     
from this physical body one day.     
But will exist always     
as a part of the social and cosmic body.    
    
O Pratibimba, to experience this kind of knowing     
do I need to read further?    
    
Yours Truly

# Article5099 : Morality Of Killing    
tags: [ 'Ethics and Morality', Philosophy, Poetry]    
    
Killing is sin and it is immoral.     
What I want to kill is not existing because of my action     
But because of my inaction.    
    
When there is the first cockroach in the house     
I must have handled that properly     
Either by throwing or killing     
But my morality of non-violence didn’t allow that to happen.    
    
Now, the whole family of cockroach has grown in my house     
What will I do now? Massacre!     
Which was better? Nipping when it was bud or doing massacre now?    
    
But why I need to do a massacre?     
Either because of my lethargy     
or because of morality principle     
or because I thought it is too small to fight with.    
    
I cannot remain in a house or in a society     
Without eliminating the weeds     
If I don’t do it someone else has to do that     
If no one does that then     
The whole field become full of weeds and     
I cannot grow anything useful in that field.    
    
So the principle of absolute non-violence     
Will make my house dirty,     
full of mosquito, cockroach, spiders, ants, etc.     
I cannot live in that house any longer.    
    
But if I keep my house clean then     
Every day I have to do a little violence     
And I can avoid a massacre of once in a month or a year.    
    
Daily cleaning or massacre     
Are the only two option to survive     
even in your own house.     
The question is who will do this?     
Either you do it yourself or     
some of your family members does it     
Or you outsource this to somebody.    
    
But we need to understand one thing     
One who is doing cleaning this work is favoring you     
You cannot claim yourself a great disciple     
of Mahatma Gandhi or Mahatma Buddha or Mahavira Jain     
And say, Ahimsa Parmodharmah (Non-violence is the absolute principle)     
Nor you have the right to abuse or downgrade the cleaner.    
    
The same logic can be extended to a society     
When you because lazy, careless or     
try to become the epitome of non-violence     
Then you cause more harm to a society     
You need to be cautious and     
from time to time clean the society     
from unhealthy ideas, thoughts, dogmas,     
hypocrisies, hardcore ideologies, thought of dominance.     
To keep the society alive and vibrant     
either the forces (police, military, etc) need to work     
Or you need to work.     
So that weeds can be kept out.    
    
In a democratic society, it is expected that     
We remain awake all the time     
And kill the unhealthy ideas when they are bud     
Or outsource this work to forces     
But if no one does this then     
Your own home will become a shelter     
for terrorist, antisocial elements,     
anti-national, Lawless, and Adharmic people.    
    
The principle of non-violence applies to friendly elements     
And it is not absolute     
You cannot apply to terrorist, anti-national, robbers     
It simply means do not allow weeds to grow around.    
    
O Pratibimba, do you think it is easy to identify     
which ideas should be killed?     
If a house will belong to snakes     
then ideas of Human has to be killed     
And if the house belongs to human     
then ideas of snakes have to be killed.    
    
But in a democratic society     
who decides who snake and who is human?     
One who spills venom is a snake!    
    
Venom doesn’t kill the snake.     
But others suffer from it.     
We know snakes and humans both     
are suffering in society.     
You decide who is a snake and who is human.     
And then take action to clean your house     
So that you need not see Mahabharat before your eyes.

# Article5100 : Thanks To Covid19    
tags: [ 'My Views', Philosophy, Prayers]    
    
We are a nation where people can pee anywhere     
spit anywhere and sneeze on anybody’s face.     
Thanks to corona some control has come.    
    
We are a society where foreign travel and     
mad travel was considered a sign of high class and busy-ness     
Today that person is considered a potential source of Corona.    
    
When our Jain Munis were moving around     
with a mask on their face world was making fun of them     
and we also joined them     
today everybody is looking for that Jain Muni Mask.    
    
We are the society which said eat vegetarian,     
Don’t kill animals to fill your stomach and     
World laughed at our silly logic     
and we also joined that group     
Today people are looking for a salad and vegetarian food.    
    
We use to greet everybody with Ram Ram Ji and Namaste     
and western people made fool of us     
They shake the hand and we liked their idea     
and we adopted that habit over a period of time     
Today world is going back to Namaste     
and we need to tell each other that no hand-shake.    
    
While learning a new habit of eating with spoon and fork     
we have forgotten our traditions have told us     
to wash our hand and mouth     
before and after we eat something.    
    
Using water and soap to clean hands and body     
after every inflow in the body and outflow from the body     
not the paper to eat with and paper to clean toilet or hand.     
Those traditions will be valued now.     
Thanks to Corona to help us learn     
why these practices were part of our traditions.    
    
Our elders used to say why you run unnecessarily     
when there is no work or work can be done from home     
You are burning petrol, going to the mall, cinema hall     
going to college to make your attendance,     
or to the office just sign a register.     
Better sit at home talk to family members.     
But we didn’t pay attention.     
Thanks to corona traffic in the sky and on the road are less     
Whether people are talking to each other     
Contemplating, meditating, praying, playing with each other     
or watching TV shows only they know.    
    
Pakistan and India were not talking for long     
Finally, we sat together face to face to talk     
But the result is zero, we are discussing Corona     
and Pakistan again discussing Kashmir.     
For the entire world, Corona is pandemic     
and it is a huge challenge     
For Pakistan the only problem is Kashmir!    
    
Thanks for Corona many good things are happening     
Hope when Corona get arrested     
People will come to know there is     
nothing unconnected in this world     
All are connected to all.     
So live sensibly and do not thrive on others’ misery.    
    
By the time Corona get arrested I hope     
People will come to know that     
apart from this mad race     
there is something more important in life.    
    
By the time Corona get arrested, I know economies will realize that     
Business like travel and tourism are     
high-risk business for the future.     
If your economy depends too much upon this     
then you can crash in no time     
and an enemy can kill you without hitting and bleeding you.

# Article5101 : Nuisance Of Translation    
tags: [ Concepts, Education, Poetry]    
    
My name is Hari Prasad and I like two food items Rasam and Idly.    
    
If foreigners don’t understand or cannot pronounce what is the meaning of the above sentence then you can do the translation for them. So translation is “Green Food likes two kinds of food items the first item is made of pulses after removing pulse and leaving spicy water and the second item is made of grind rice paste cooked at steam and it is disk-shaped”.    
    
The situation becomes too bad in Japan, China, and Korea where people cannot even pronounce Indian name and they use Chinese or Japanese equivalent.    
    
And we think by doing the above translation we have conveyed that idea and they have understood. But the whole translation is wrong and they will never understand till the time they have experience with Indian culture. Because we don’t know their language and they don’t know our language so we chose a common language like English for communication.    
    
We need to understand there are many non-translatable in every language and you cannot translate them using one-word replacement with another language.    
    
Verbs like Eat, Drink, Walk are common verbs across the world so you can translate them from one language to another. Nouns like Table, Floor, Mango, Apple are common nouns so you can translate them also in another language.    
    
Words that represent a big process or outcome of a complicated process or pure philosophical or abstract cannot be translated. In the initial stage, we try to translate so that other people can understand the basics of our culture, traditions, and philosophy.    
    
Some Non-translatable words which do not have any equivalent in the English language are mentioned below. My suggestion is when you are talking to some Indian person please do not confuse them by doing translation until they don’t have any idea of these terms. Almost all Indian people understand the meaning of these. Unfortunately, many English-speaking people including Gurus and Acharaya do translate these words. My second request is when you are talking to a non-Indian person then try to use the original word and explain to them the meaning and don’t give a one-word substitution. Otherwise, you are diluting the Atma of the word. I know it is painful to explain especially when lots of one-word substitution has been created by many English-speaking Acharya of modern time but still try to understand that by doing so you confuse others, dilute the meaning and demean your own culture.    
    
In the 19th and 20th century when our great Acharyas were doing this translation that time situation was completely different and nobody was listening to us so this translation was necessary. Today when Indians are everywhere and lots of investment is happening or already happened in translating, understanding our ancient scripture this translation is not required. In fact many of these words like Atma, Guru, Karma, Yoga, Pandita has taken place in the English dictionary. In that situation, it is our duty to spend time and try to understand the deeper and correct meaning of Samskrut Non-Translatable words and communicate them as they exist.

Shri Rajiv Malhotra’s Book [Being Different](https://beingdifferentbook.com/) helped me to understand this nuisance of our culture and I have written this from his inspiration. The above list can be expended but the above terms came on top of my mind so wrote them to help others to understand the nuisance of translation.    
    
<div>Based on my time availability, I will expand this work in the future. If you are interested in working on this then don’t hesitate to write/call me.

# Article5102 : What Is The Waking State Of Life?    
tags: [ Mindfulness, Moksha, Philosophy]    
    
A person has done some heinous crime against another person. Police caught him and presented in court and the court sentenced him to be hanged on a certain date. Police personnel taking the person to be hanged. This person can run away and there are not many police people so that policeman wraps that person in some plastic and binds him tightly so that he cannot run away before he is taken to jail for hanging.    
    
I meet this police head constable on the road he tells me the above story briefly. And then handover that body to me along with the court order copy. And tells me please ensure this person is hanged by this time. Otherwise, you and I both will be in trouble. And that police person disappears from the scene.    
    
Now I am feeling a sense of duty to finish this task. I take this criminal bound in polythene wrapper, in my left arm. I am not feeling any weight from this person. I start traveling towards the place where an authorized person can hang the criminal. I don’t know the place. So searching for this place in the city.    
    
I realized I am in Pondicherry and people are not understanding my language so I need to communicate in English. But all people don’t know English. There are many people who can understand French and Tamil. But, I don’t know French that much to communicate clearly. I am asking people where is the place where they hang criminals. They were guiding me to the place. Someone asked me why do you want to go there? I told this person in my hands need to be hanged this task has been given to me and here is the court order. That person asked me you are carrying this person packed in polythene for a long in your arms, is that person living? If he is not living then you want to hang a dead person? I said I don’t know. But after a few seconds, that person coughs from the polythene wrap to prove that he is living. But doesn’t make any other movement in the body. Lying in my arms live completely motionless. Not even breathing.    
    
I was fed up on the road and it is summer late morning around 10 am in Pondicherry. People are not helping me and I am getting tired. Then I thought, let me take an auto-rickshaw and pay him for helping me. Whatever is the expense I will claim from govt because this is a government job.    
    
I am looking for an auto and calling him for help. While the auto is coming to me and crossing the road, I am thinking who is the person in my hands? What crime he has done? Why he is so weightless? How can he remain unmoved without breathing and still living in my hands?    
    
Now my dream breaks by the 5 am alarm on my phone. And for 90 minutes I am puzzled and finally writing this incident. What was the dream that which I saw or this where I am questioning? I don’t know.    
    
I heard morning dreams are meaningful and they have an important message for us. It is a guidance of divine forces in advance. Probably universal cosmic power wants to make me prepared for something. I don’t know.    
    
I don’t know whether good or bad is going to happen so anxiety is obvious. But after so many ups and downs in life, I started understanding that this waking state is also a dream state in human life.    
    
We think that a state where we ask the more fundamental questions and validate the purpose of happening and incidents in life is a waking state but when we are in a dream state then those events and questions there are not any less real. Whatever we know and experience is our reality when we wake to another state of existence then previous reality looks unreal, illogical. Fight, desperation, struggle, enjoyment, people, relationships of that state, money, power, poverty all disappear as soon as the state changes.    
    
In life we go through the three states everyday, waking, dream, and sleep. In whatever state we live in life is the reality until we are living there. Once we move to the next level of awareness then all past state actions, environments, the relationship looks lessor real, fake, and foolish act. The question is how long it takes for a person to move from one state of awareness to another state of awareness. Death is waking to another state of awareness. Every day when our older bodies and ideas die we wake up for new dimensions of life. The dead body gets dissolve into five primary elements of the body but awareness continues.    
    
Life is that which has no relationship with death. “Life” is a noun, not a verb. When the living(verb) process is happening in a body then life (noun) moves to another place for living and the previous body falls.

# Article5103 : The Play Is Over    
tags: [ Mindfulness, Philosophy]    
    
When I was small, I used to cry for toys,     
My parents gave me those     
I played with those toys, very seriously     
So seriously that if someone hides them     
or break them I will create huge unrest in the family     
I will cry from the top of my voice     
And let others know what unjust has happened to me.    
    
As time passes in life     
My toys keep changing     
Every step I move forward I was laughing     
at the toys of the previous step.    
    
Education grade, degree, job, promotion, marriage, children, their marriage,     
their settlement all are our toys.     
When these toys are around us     
We use to take and play them seriously.     
And so seriously that we are ready     
To do anything to acquire a better quality toy     
We are ready to do anything     
To polish and to maintain a good toy.    
    
Even in childhood, I knew I am different     
and my toy is different from me.     
We both are not the same.    
    
Now, I am experiencing my body is also my toy.     
Because I am not a body and     
I am playing in the field using this.    
    
Now, I am experiencing my emotions,     
mind, intellect are also my toys.     
Because I am neither of these and     
I am playing with these.    
    
Do you think this is the sign of Play is over?     
I think I can still play without letting others know that     
I am not serious about the game now.     
I am not serious about the toys now.     
I am just playing because of the inertia     
of earlier plays keeping me in the ground     
and moving this body     
from one corner of the field to another.    
    
I can experience this play,     
which my body is playing the field called Samsara.    
    
O Chaitnya, Have I understood Maya?

# Article5104 : Desire Renunciation And A Limited Self    
tags: [ Philosophy, Poetry]    
    
Namaste    
    
We know without desire living is not possible.     
It amazes me the way     
the concept of desirelessness     
has been taught and understood in our society.    
    
We know a desire and dreams     
helps human moving in his life     
With desire human eat, drink and walk,     
With desire human talk, dance and sing,     
With desire human search, paint, and construct.     
With the desire, we want to live and die!    
    
If everything happens with desire     
then how can we say     
a desire is not good hence be desireless?    
    
How can we say desirelessness is     
the highest state of existence?     
It is a state of Rushiness!    
    
We exist in a society,     
and we have relations     
with the people around us.     
Relations which carry their names.    
    
The name may be a friend, parents, son     
sister, brother, neighbor, citizen     
native, member, acquainted, or even unknown.    
    
Each named relation has its own Dharma     
And we interact with people around     
in the guidance of that dharma     
Dharma has attached responsibilities and actions.    
    
If the desire is not at the root of all actions,     
Then how can we do our Dharma (actions)?     
How come a Dharma driven society     
is taught to be desireless?    
    
Perhaps the meaning of desire     
has been misunderstood and miscommunicated     
Perhaps they wanted to communicate that     
don’t desire anything for the self.     
And we as a society and an individual     
failed to understand     
the meaning of desirelessness.    
    
Ah! philosophy is fine,     
but how can a thinking person     
work tirelessly without bothering for the self?     
When we exist as a body,     
Our first dharma is towards our nearest,     
And our living body is nearest to us.    
    
How can we be Dharmi     
while ignoring our nearest,     
this body, and this mind?    
    
Your philosophies say with selfish desire     
a human becomes cruel.     
But is this a problem of desire or limited self?    
    
If all the time we are thinking     
about me and mine     
and this me and mine is so narrow     
that it never crosses two-three people     
around us and our own body,     
Then this narrow me and mine     
is the source of pain, problems, and conflicts.    
    
We do not suffer because of desire     
We suffer because of the narrow me and mine!    
    
Desire to live is a basic desire     
this is prevalent in all living beings     
that is why the fight and flight response is inbuilt in all lives.     
And this is the basis of human survival.     
In the absence of desire why to fight or why to flight?     
Be ready to die all the time!    
    
In human life, desires can be of any size and kind     
But we need to keep in mind that     
Before I desire something I need to understanding “I”     
And expand the living experience of “I”     
So that human does not suffer     
because of limited identity, a limited “I”.    
    
In that state of awareness whatever largest “I” you experience,     
Desire from that perspective,     
Larger your umbrella of awareness     
Lesser is the problem in your desire.    
    
Your larger experience can be     
I am a family of 5 people or     
Village of thousand people or     
City of million people or     
Religion of billion people or     
Nation of billions of people or     
Male or Female of half human population or     
Humanity of this earth or     
Living being of this planet or     
Brahmin, the ultimate being of cosmos.    
    
We are not animal of the forest     
who just bother about their bodily survival,     
their family or their race.     
A wise human can desire     
for co-existence, happy existence of all.     
But that is possible only when     
when I think about the survival of my unlimited “Self”     
And what is this unlimited “Self”?    
    
Your philosophies say (Vidhur Niti)     
For the sake of a family, one person can be renounced     
For the sake of a village, one family can be renounced     
For the sake of a Janapada, one village can be renounced     
For the sake of “Self”, one Janapada or Kingdom can be renounced.    
    
We need to introspect,     
What is that “Self” which motivates     
human to remain in motion and action?    
    
What is that self for which, sages say,     
human should not desire?    
    
What is that “Self” for which, Upanishad     
is recommending to leave the kingdom?

# Article5105 : Relationship Of No Relations    
tags: [ Philosophy]    
    
My universe, my world, my nation, my city,     
my religion, my society, my family, my child,     
my mother, my sister, my body, my hand.    
    
Did you observe the gradation of my-ness increasing?     
This is how relationship grading happens in our life.     
We try to defend, protect, and fight for the closest first     
and then the next one.    
    
If the closest relationship is in problems     
then it hurts us more and we are more reactive in that situation     
whether we can do anything or not but     
our anxiety, suffering, helplessness, desire to fight     
start taking shape at that moment.    
    
If the same relationship causes little problems for us     
then it is capable of creating the highest suffering for us.     
It means the closeness of a relationship     
has something to the degree of our suffering.    
    
If we don’t have or feel any relationships with X     
then we can defend ourselves better     
in the situation of verbal or physical attack.    
    
Is it possible that people and the world exist around us     
but we don’t give any name to the relationship?     
For example a child, sister, mother, nation, city etc     
without any my-ness?    
    
It will not harm you or excite you Unnecessarily.     
If required, you will do whatever needs to be done     
based on the situation and Dharma,     
which is coming from the existence and not from my-ness.     
A relationship does not end with what we do or can do.     
It goes to another end called expectations from others.    
    
What more suffering is possible for a person,     
who has completely dissolved my-ness     
from the relationship with the world around?     
Who neither expects nor reject help from others?     
Who does what needs to be done.     
He does what he can do.    
    
Many people think that this kind of person     
will become irresponsible and lazy?     
The answer to this is “you try” it for some time     
and do not debunk the concept or extrapolate     
which is coming out of pure imagination of yours.    
    
There is no other hell in the world     
And no one is capable of creating any hell     
If you do what needs to be done     
and drop the name of relation and expectations from them.    
    
People try to run away from other people and the world around     
Without dropping the name of the relation.     
With that kind of mind, no matter which Himalaya you go     
You are fully capable of creating your own hell.    
    
O Chaitanya, what your experiences have     
unfolded for you in the world of relationships?

# Article5106 : Self Realization    
tags: [ Moksha, Philosophy, Poetry]    
    
What is the meaning of Self-Realization?     
What is the meaning of Liberation?     
What is the meaning of Self-Actualization?     
What is the meaning of God-Realization?     
What is the meaning of Moksha?     
What is the meaning of Becoming one with God?    
    
Whatever I do physically, mentally, or verbally     
If I have known and convinced myself fully that     
I have a body, I am not a body.     
I have a mind, I am not a mind.     
I have some memories, I am not memories.     
I have objects, people, and relations around     
but I am neither of these.     
Then I am on the path of Moksha.    
    
If I have convinced myself that     
the world which I enjoy, suffer,     
watch, observe, cry, and laugh at is my world.     
Knowing all the subtle shackles around me     
are my conscious or unconscious creation.     
And I am the creator, Brahma, of this world and     
no one created this world me but me only     
Then I am on the path of Moksha.    
    
If I have convinced myself that     
In my whole life till now     
I have seen the world around     
But I have not seen my real eyes     
What I saw is a reflection of my eyes,     
And even after that, I say I have eyes!     
Then I don’t believe in having eyes.    
    
Their presence gives me the experience of     
color, shape, and different size around.     
When experience exists then why should I believe?     
This realization is uplifting me from believing     
and taking me towards experiencing.     
Now I am on the path of Moksha.    
    
If I have convinced myself that     
whatever Brahma has created     
Can be destroyed by Shiva,     
no matter how ugly or dear is that.     
Therefore the world around me     
which is causing me suffering     
I can destroy this world by opening     
my third eye and becoming Shiva.     
No “Shiva” will destroy the real world around me.     
But I as Shiva will destroy my own suffering     
I can break all the barriers, walls and     
boundaries of the jail     
in which I have arrested my own existence.     
Now I am on the path of Moksha.    
    
Iswara Prapti means I know and experience that     
Ishwara was never lost.     
I was lost, and now I am back home.     
There is nothing to receive (Prapti)     
except to live in my own existence     
and not in the mental Imagination     
Of my own or created from     
those entertaining stories.    
    
There is nothing in getting Moksha     
except knowing and experiencing that     
there is no shackle there is no bondage.    
    
Apart from this experience of your own     
Whatever you heard from     
those stories of your religion     
are good for entertaining a restless mind.     
They can temporary solace you     
but that is not the final solution     
of your eternal bondage and suffering.    
    
O Chaitnya, Know thyself as free,     
You are like an elephant     
which is tied to a small plant     
with a small thin rope and     
you think there is bondage!

# Article5107 : Mystery Of Time And Space    
tags: [ Concepts]    
    
Let us look into time first.    
One minute is made of 60 seconds    
One second is made of 1000 milliseconds.    
One millisecond is made of 1000 microseconds.    
What is the smallest unit of time is made of?    
The “present” time is only that.    
    
By the time you blink eyes    
the present becomes past.    
The “present” is so small that    
we even do not know how small is that.    
This is the reason either it is    
One microsecond or one minute or    
one hour or one day or one year old, all are past.    
    
All units of time either minute or second or microsecond    
Can measure only “past” time or “future” time    
You measure only that which is passed or    
when it is about to pass    
There is no way to measure the present    
There is no watch which shows the “present” time    
because “present” is so small.    
    
Let’s say you have a watch which can    
measure microsecond on some wall    
A watch is showing the tick of the "time passed"    
You even cannot count that    
because “present” is so small.    
    
For some creatures, one second is too long    
For other creatures, 10 years is too short    
In human experience, if 20 static frame moves before us    
in one second then we call it is moving,    
and we get an illusion of a movie.    
20 frames a one seconds means    
One frame in 50 milliseconds    
There are many lives which have a total life of only 50 ms.    
For human it is just one frame    
and some life have lived their life fully.    
    
What is that from which “present” takes birth?    
Is the time only human and mental creation?    
Is time an unreal thing but    
serve the real purpose of coordination with surrounding?    
If it is so then billions of watches on this planet are    
measuring something which only exists in the mind.    
It has no physical existence    
and it is definitely not showing the “present” time.    
    
For scientists, time is scalar and vector both    
Because it moves in some direction so it is a vector.    
But we know this move only in forward direction and    
this forwardness is so implicit that    
we even don’t bother about this aspect    
and we measure only the duration that is why it is scalar.    
They use a watch to measure the duration and    
for doing that they do the round off of time    
either in minutes or seconds or anything    
whatever serves their purpose.    
    
Now let us look space.    
We know a living body is made of proteins,    
Proteins are made of molecules,    
Molecules are made of atoms,    
Atoms are made of subatomic particles,    
Subatomic particles are made of quarks,    
Quarks are vibrations of    
something “unknown” in the field.    
    
What is the that “unknown” of which quark is made of?    
What is that “field” made of in which    
“unknown” vibrates and gives rise to quark,    
subatomic particles, atoms, molecules, proteins,    
bodies and phenomenon world around?    
    
Science is still struggling to know the answer to this    
But, religious people say their god and messenger    
have told everything in their holy book.    
Meditators get lost in that timeless and spaceless    
existence and come fresh to live again.    
    
O Chaitanya, are you a struggling scientist    
or a religious person who knows everything    
or a child like me who know nothing    
about this phenomenal world around    
and puzzled all the time    
That how things happened and    
how it is happening and    
what is the meaning of happening?

# Article5108 : A Mirage Of Happiness    
tags: [ Philosophy, 'Pleasure &amp; Joy', Poetry]    
    
People are Chasing Happiness     
And arguing measuring Happiness Index     
is better than GDP Index     
I thought to talk with you about my journey.    
    
In a desert, I walk and run     
In the hope of water     
The desire for water is real in me     
But not real water there     
How to drink that nectar of this planet,     
Which is nowhere here in this desert?    
    
Happiness is that kind of mirage land     
For which human have a real desire     
To drink but nowhere there is the world     
Except it is perceived at the far distance or     
At the backyard of some other person’s house or     
At the trough in the desert.    
    
But when you reach there after your long journey     
Then you realize it is not here too     
We keep inspiring fellow travelers     
To walk a little more, to work a little more     
You will get it when you reach there or     
achieve which you value in life.    
    
We are inspiring people to achieve that     
Which we ourselves never got outside     
Our children work hard to achieve that     
Which we don’t have     
A child can work hard to follow elders     
You can motivate a child     
to work hard for a whole day     
And finally, give him a chocolate     
so that he can feel good.     
But a child in me has understood     
the trick of people around me     
You want to keep me busy the whole day     
for a bar of chocolate that too when I am not hungry.    
    
I am a child of the goddess of death     
I want to play just because     
I am out from my mother’s lap and     
Not because I want to become happy     
by taking your tempting chocolate     
But because I love to play.    
    
This world is a mirage of happiness     
There is no happiness there     
It is not an object to get anywhere but     
It is my experience during play     
I don’t get happiness but I am happiness     
A mad run for that which I am and     
I am established in that.    
    
O Chaitnya, know thyself that     
in essence, you are nothing but Ananda     
But without knowing your essence you are     
running like a dear is running for a musk.

# Article5109 : Love As A Service    
tags: [ Philosophy, Poetry]    
    
Have you ever seen a person     
Who hires someone else to love     
his/her spouse and children?    
    
It is unthinkable,     
we call that person     
out of his mind.    
    
Have you seen any person     
Who hires someone to write poetry and sing     
for his/her loved one or for his/her spouse?    
    
You will say,     
This is madness,     
Better remain silent     
what is the use of doing this nonsense     
If you truly love someone and     
That person is in his/her sense     
then he/she will know.     
If not then this business of hiring     
some else to please     
your loved one will not go long.    
    
But there are enough people who say     
they believe in God     
They love their God.     
But they hire someone else     
to do the prayer on their behalf.    
    
Not only that they cannot write     
their own feeling towards their god.     
So they read books to please their God.    
    
They hire musicians to sing     
on their behalf before their God     
Once the program is over     
They think their God is happy.    
    
There are enough number of people     
Who believe reading some prayer or     
some book 3 times or 5 times a day     
will keep their God happy and     
they can avoid His wrath.    
    
Those who believe in this kind of God     
Or this trick of pleasing their God     
Their God is not much intelligent than     
their own small thinking.     
In this situation, even if their God becomes happy     
what that unintelligent God can do for them?    
    
If your God is omnipresent,     
omnipotent, omniscient     
Then that God must be expecting     
some basic intelligent from you     
Why do you consider Him fool and     
play the trick with Him?    
    
O Chaitanya, if you love someone sincerely     
then do not hire someone else     
to praise or pray before that.     
Spend time, put your heart and mind     
Get soaked into that love.     
Love can never be sold as a service.

Does color exists independent     
from human eyes sensation?     
Colour is nothing but a vibration of light radiation.     
These vibrations exist independently and     
received differently by different eyes     
depending on how good your eyes are.     
Thus the color which you perceive is not     
the same which really exists.    
    
Does size exists independent     
from human mind sensation?     
Different objects from atom to stars exist around us.     
But all perceived differently     
by the different human minds.     
In childhood, a cricket bat looks like a tree size big,     
our village looks like a planet     
but with time it changes.     
If we have a lemon and a football before us then     
everyone perceives the size difference differently.     
If you see the moon outside through a small hole     
then you will perceive the ratio of the size     
of the hole and size of the moon     
differently than others.     
Thus the size which you perceive is not     
the same which really exists.    
    
Does sound exists independent     
from human ear sensation?     
Sound is vibration it exists when air is present     
Whether you listen or not and     
what you listen is up to you.     
Meaning of same sound varies     
for different culture, societies, individual     
and it also depends upon the time     
when you listen to a sound.     
Thus the sound which you perceive is not     
the same which really exists.    
    
Does taste exists independent     
from human tongue sensation?     
Taste exists independently of the human tongue     
but not the way sound and light exist.     
Because sound and light exist as vibration     
but taste exists as the essence of the object.     
Flower, cotton, fruits, vegetables     
all have different essence and different chemicals     
therefore their taste exists separately.     
Thus the taste which you perceive is not     
the same which really exists.    
    
Does touch exists independent     
from human skin sensation?     
The softness or temperature of the surface     
exists independent from the human sense of touch.     
It doesn’t exist as vibration like sound and light     
Neither it exists like the taste,     
which is the essence of objects.     
But it exists like changeable essence.     
Surface of table, the temperature of bread or tea,     
smoothness of cloth is not perceived the same by all.     
It varies from time to time and person to person.     
Thus the touch which you perceive is not     
the same which really exists.    
    
Does smell exists independent    
    
from human nose sensation?    
    
Smell of a flower, cow dung,     
mud after the first rain of the season,     
samber, rice is not the same for everybody.     
Smell is the essence of the objects around     
but it travels in the air     
Neither it exists like vibration of sound and light.     
Nor it exists like the taste and touch     
which is the essence and unmovable from the object.     
Neither it is like touch     
which is the essence but changes with time.     
We know that a smell exists independently     
and is integral to the objects.     
Thus the smell which you perceive is not     
the same which really exists.    
    
What we perceive from our five senses and mind     
depends least upon essence     
and content of the objects     
and it depends most upon the essence     
and content of our own mind.    
    
O Chaitnya, if it is so, that the sensation     
which you perceive depends mostly upon     
the content of your own mind then     
why don’t you create a mind which     
can smell the jasmine in all objects,     
can see the self in all objects,     
can listen a music of your own soul from all objects,     
can taste the taste of your own tongue and     
can sense the softness which you feel     
when you fold your hands together?

# Article5111 : Dissolving A Drop In The Ocean    
tags: [ Moksha, Poetry, Vedanta]    
    
Some drops are hard as stone     
It takes millions of years to make     
them and millions to dissolve.    
    
Some drops are like salt ball     
It takes longer to make them     
but they dissolve quickly.    
    
Some drops have a dirty smell     
When those merge into the ocean     
for some time there is a bad smell around them     
but very soon they also disappear.    
    
Some drops are of good smell     
When those merge into the ocean     
for some time there is fragrance around them     
but very soon they that also disappear.    
    
Nothing remains, whether it takes time or happen quickly.     
Nothing remains, whether the drop is good or bad.     
Nothing remains, whether the drop is beautiful or ugly.     
The drop gets dissolved in the ocean.    
    
From where the drop of water comes?     
From a bigger water pool.    
    
From where the water pool come?     
From a river stream or rain.    
    
From where rain comes?     
From the ocean.    
    
From where ocean come?     
Well, it is part of the earth,     
from whatever source earth comes     
water comes from the same source.    
    
After coming into existence     
does drop have an identity?     
Well, if not so then how can we say     
that this is my water and that is your water?    
    
You will say that I know this but drop doesn’t know.     
But how do you know that drop doesn’t know?     
How it is possible which is the source of every life     
on this planet itself is lifeless?     
We can discuss this some other time.    
    
For now let us see, how long a drop lives?     
Well, it depends on the size of a drop     
and also depends upon the surrounding of the drop.     
In a hostile environment like a desert,     
burning stove, or flood it will die quickly.     
In another environment, it can have a longer life.    
    
And how a drop takes birth, live, and die?     
A drop can know experimentally     
that I have come from the ocean     
Live on the surface of an ocean     
And merge in the ocean     
My dissolution and disappearance     
is called death by the surrounding     
but very next moment I appear     
on the other part of the ocean’s surface.    
    
And many times I join other     
who are mourning my death from my past life     
because they think “that” drop was the great drop.     
So we should offer some flower to that     
and remember the work that drop did.    
    
Yoga was the way drop lived     
Whether you sing or dance,     
Cry or weep, laugh or smile     
eat or drink, breath or blink     
Create or destroy some other drops around     
Every moment you are navigating     
your life from one corner to another corner     
on the surface of the ocean called consciousness.    
    
Whether you do Bhakti yoga, sing, dance,     
pray and praise your Lord.     
Or you do Karma yoga, work without fatigue     
and surrender all the results     
of your action at the feet of your Lord.    
    
Whether you do Hatha yoga,     
control your physical and mental body at your will     
Or you do Gnyana yoga,     
know your true nature,     
transcend the Maya around     
and live the way like you are playing     
on the ground because have time.    
    
All are the ways of dissolving     
your little drop to the cosmic ocean     
And be one with the cosmos.    
    
How long you will protect your drop     
One day it merges to the ocean     
from where it has come.     
On this planet, that process is called death.    
    
But if you do this consciously     
and let it happen every day then     
the same process of unification is called Yoga.    
    
While sitting at a place we think     
Only time is changing and the place is the same.     
But on a planet that is moving     
with 67,000 miles per hour around the sun     
And rotating on its own axis     
with 1000 miles per hours     
It is foolish to say that we are staying     
at the same place even after one hour.    
    
The truth is we moved millions of miles away     
in the sky, since the time we have taken birth.     
But the drop never knows that and neither bother     
because drop rises from the ocean     
and fall back on the surface of the ocean.     
And this is the only and limited experience of a drop.    
    
Those who are counting Atma or soul     
are counting drops on the surface of the ocean.     
Without knowing the size of a drop!     
Without realizing the depth of the ocean!     
Without realizing that the ocean is also a drop in space!!    
    
What is the way to know you are drop?     
What is the way to know     
you are a deer who have musk in your own body?    
    
Nothing. Just stop running     
and spend your time and energy knowing this.     
But the real question is     
what will happen even if you know you are a drop?     
And the next question is,     
why should I know, which I already know?    
    
What Karna did even after knowing from Kunti     
that her real mother is Kunti and not Radha?     
That was the moment of realization     
for Radheya that he is Kaunteya.    
    
He still fought on behalf of Duryodhana     
He still wanted to kill Arjuna     
But we know fighting was not the same for Karna     
something fundamentally has changed     
in him after this realization.     
That is the power of self-realization.    
    
If you truly know that you are a drop     
then something fundamentally will change in you     
Perhaps your dissolving will not be painful.    
    
Perhaps your reactions     
to the surrounding will turn into the response.     
A response that is appropriate     
and need of the hour     
But free from jealousy, anger,     
competition, compulsion     
and desire to demolish other drops.    
    
Perhaps your madness for enjoying     
every drop of your life juice will reduce.    
    
Perhaps your madness to exploit     
the planet and lives around will diminish.    
    
Perhaps the way you talk     
and think about others will alter.    
    
Perhaps you will move beyond     
grief, sorrow, happiness &amp; joy     
and enter into unconditional blissfulness.    
    
O Chaitnya, you may be thinking     
this all is mental imagination.     
If so then the entire Vedanta is imagination     
and your reality is much horrible without a solution.    
    
Do you think millions of people     
in Indian civilization spend thousands of years     
and the best gave us is Vedanta     
and that is just mental imagination?    
    
Perhaps they knew what is good for us     
and we don’t know what is good for us     
that is why we struggle all the time     
to protect &amp; survive our drop and nothing beyond.

# Article5112 : Human Faith and Need Of God    
tags: [ Dharma, Philosophy]    
    
Human life is full of uncertainties     
Whether you are in a war zone    
or playing sports on the ground    
Whether writing software for a customer    
or plowing with bullock in the field    
Whether going to the office for your work    
or traveling to an unknown place.    
Risks are spread everywhere.    
     
    
What is the risk?    
An event which can happen     
when you are doing something else.    
You didn’t plan to do that but it happens.    
     
    
You are going to your office and     
while paying for the taxi you realize     
you have forgotten your phone and purse at home.     
Here risk has occurred.    
     
    
You are planning to buy a car and you lose your job.    
You are enjoying your picnic and you fall sick.    
You are having a party and a police raid happens.    
There are infinite kind of thing can happen     
when you are doing something important in your life.    
     
Sometimes the results of these events are bad.    
Sometimes the results of these events are good.    
     
You are in a new city and looking for a job     
and you find job interviewer is your school time friend.     
You are not liking your boss     
and you heard she has resigned.    
You are almost bankrupt and you hear one news that     
you won a lottery of one crore rupees.    
These are other kinds of uncertain events.    
     
    
We wish that bad risk or     
bad surprises should not occur     
and good risk or     
good surprises should occur in our life.    
But, both are not in human control.    
     
    
Human is a highly intelligent creature    
Human has the power of imagination    
So he wants to plan everything    
When results are per his plan he calls it a success     
or it is called fail, even if you do not tell     
Others will remind you of your failure.    
But, human knows always things     
will not as per his plan.    
     
    
How to handle those situations which happens     
and produce results that he didn’t think off.    
When I fail then how can I bounce back?    
This is the place he needs the support of faith.    
He says something more powerful     
than me or my community     
is controlling the results of my actions.    
     
    
If I can influence that then     
the results can be in my favor.    
Some start looking towards the sky.    
Some towards east,    
Some towards west,    
There are enough people around us    
to tell the stories how their life changed     
after believing in some XYZ,     
or converting to ABC faith,     
or when they gave ten rupees     
to some poor people or to some religious place.    
Religious books are full of those stories.    
     
    
The cheapest insurance cover     
in the situation of helplessness is belief.    
Whether you are educated or uneducated    
If you have stopped using     
your mind thinking about life     
and all the time thinking about so-called     
realities or trauma or anxieties     
or past failure of your life then the best way     
for you to pass over this rough tunnel     
is believe or take a drink and get lost.    
Some chose method one some chose method two.    
     
    
O Chaitnya, Is there any other third way     
to handle the uncertain moments in life?    
     
    
I think, Yes. Just be witness!    
But, that is possible only through     
long and sustained practice.

# Article5113 : Saving The Moon    
tags: [ 'Philosophy for Business', Poetry]    
    
You know my friend Pratibimba,    
He is a big man, but sometimes    
he behaves like a child and too naive about the reality around.    
Once upon a time,    
It was the day of the festival and late evening    
and he was traveling through a forest    
Long he traveled and feeling thirsty.    
    
Soon he found a well    
He thought he can make some arrangements to fetch the water    
But for that, he needs to know how deep is the well.    
He saw inside the well.    
He found there is clean water but the well is deep.    
    
While looking in the well    
he realized moon is inside the well.    
He felt sad, how this moon has fallen in this forest well!    
Nobody is around here and probably    
this moon is waiting for me to help and take him out.    
    
Pratibimba is a very kind, helpful and moral person    
He was worried about the moon    
Not only that, today is the festival    
and people are waiting for the moon to break their fast    
People in the world may not be aware    
that today the moon is in trouble and it will not come.    
    
My friend was worried about the people    
how will they break their fast if they don’t see the moon?    
Now he realized he had a big responsibility    
to save both humanity and moon.    
    
He took the challenge and started    
doing his planning to take moon out of the well.    
Soon he found a rope, put a knot to the rope    
To tie and bring back the moon.    
    
The rope went inside but stuck to some stone.    
It was dark so he couldn’t see    
but soon he realized    
while he is pulling the rope is heavy    
it means moon is hooked to his rope.    
    
He pulled the rope and the rope broke    
He falls back on the ground    
and had some head injuries    
Thirsty he was, so became unconscious for sometime.    
    
After sometime when he came to his consciousness    
He saw the moon is in the sky.    
Although, he was tired and injured    
but he felt very happy that    
Finally because of my efforts moon is saved    
and people are able to break their fast    
and celebrate the festival.    
    
It was me to whom god used to serve humanity.    
It was me to whom god used to save    
the poor and helpless moon.    
I am such a religious and upright person that    
next life I will be Prophet or Thirthankar or incarnation of Vishnu.    
    
You may be laughing at my friend’s state of mind    
In fact, I also laughed when he told me this.    
But soon after he left, I asked myself    
how many times we try to solve the problem    
which doesn’t exist or which we created?    
And then wait for appreciation, recognition    
and award for solving such problems.    
    
Our morality, uprightness, and efforts    
to save the world is nothing but our own madness.    
A problem exists because we exist and the way we think.    
A problem exist becayse we think others are    
the problem and I am the solution.    
    
A problem exists because we think    
people are asking my help    
so there must be serious real problem.    
    
People cry in their suffering    
Because they feel they have lost which was theirs.    
    
People laugh in their joy    
Because they feel they have got    
something which was not theirs.    
    
O Chaitanya, take a deep 3 deep breaths    
and think from where you started your journey    
and where you stand today?    
    
Think about the problem which you are trying to solve    
Is it really a problem or you are ballooning it unnecessarily?    
Is this problem created by others    
or you yourself created that out of your own desire    
to enjoy the world and avoid the suffering.

# Article5114 : The Nature Of Karma Fala    
tags: [ Dharma, Philosophy]    
    
Fruits may be sweet or bitter, rotten, ripe, or raw.     
These are the attributes attached to a fruit.     
You cannot take these attributes away from the fruit.     
Like heat cannot be taken away from the fire.    
    
Good or bad are not attributes of a fruit     
like the heat is an attribute of the fire.     
Every fruit has some essence     
and fruit cannot exist if you remove all those the essence.    
    
Essense of the sweetness of the fruit is inside the fruit     
but goodness is not inside the fruit.     
Because goodness is not the essence of the fruit.    
    
Good or bad is not an attribute of the fruit.     
This classification of good and bad     
of fruit resides in the human mind.    
    
If you get what you want     
at the time when you want     
then you label it good     
otherwise, you call that bad.    
    
When you were a child and like mango fruit     
then what sow is a mango seed.     
But by the time seed becomes a tree     
and gives the fruit of your karma     
you become sick and cannot eat mango     
Now you cannot say that     
the fruit of my karma (mango) is not good.    
    
Now if you need Neem leaf     
or neem fruit for the cure then     
it is not available because you have not sown that.    
    
Because Neem is going to cure you     
and someone gives you Neem     
It doesn’t neem is good now.     
You are labeling it good.    
    
In life, we cannot live without Karma     
At every moment of life, we do some     
mental or physical or vocal karma.     
Some of those Karma bear the fruits immediately,     
like feeling the heat when you go near to the fire.    
    
Some of the Karma bear fruit after one year,     
like studying for the annual exam.     
Some of the Karma bears fruit after 2 months,     
Like your prepare for a job interview.     
Some of the Karma bears fruit at an unknown time     
Like you think ill or good about somebody     
And you go through mental trouble at another time.    
    
The principle of Karma Fala is too intrigued.     
You don’t know in what format     
it will come back when.     
No matter how much consciously you work     
In life many times you have to chew     
that fruit which you don’t want at that time.     
If you like it you call it good     
If you don’t like it then you name it bad.    
    
But there is nothing absolute bad Fala or good Fala     
Good and bad depends on what you get     
in what situation and time.    
    
O Pratibimba, do you still think     
there is good Karam and bad Karma?     
Do you still think there is     
Good Karama Fala and Bad Karma Fala?     
Do you still think Good Karma leads to Swarga     
and Bad Karma Leads to Narka?    
    
Good, Bad, Swarga, Narga is your own state of mind     
Where is the duality for that     
who has transcended this Duality?     
But is it that easy to experience that non-duality?    
    
And because we cannot experience that non-duality     
which really exists it doesn’t mean that     
we create something out of our own imagination!

One who tells me the utility of those relations and objects,     
We call that person our Guru.    
    
But, when I open my eyes and see     
the people and objects around     
I know and experience the world around     
The way I live, The way I wish to live,     
The way I struggle,     
The way I exist in my own nature.    
    
What has been taught to me has     
some value from Guru’s perspective.     
What shapes my mind and experiences     
come from my desire to know,     
experience, and liberate from ignorance?     
That ignorance, which is the cause of my suffering     
And liberation comes from our own striving.    
    
With borrowed questions,     
I cannot become a good student     
With too many casual questions     
I cannot get that who can show me the path.    
    
The cosmic omniscient principle which knows everything     
can become our Guru but for that, an Intellect &amp; Shraddha     
which can communicate with a formless,     
all-pervading, eternal being is needed.    
    
In whatever tradition we live     
we have some guiding light,     
where we surrender and from where we seek guidance.     
That is the light of Guru which guides our life.    
    
It is most effective when we seek guidance     
in the moment of confusion, chaos, delusion, and suffering.     
But healing and cure happen when what is inside us     
and who is guiding us from outside become one.    
    
A flag is not a nation, it represents the nation     
Even without a flag nation exists.     
A body is not a guru, it represents the guru     
Even without a body Guru exists.    
    
How do we connect with our Guru?     
By doing prayer, puja, and worship?     
By begging, donating, and seeking favor?    
    
Guru doesn’t answer all small or     
big questions from his mouth always.     
But makes you capable of asking deeper questions     
and seeking the answer by your own striving.    
    
Assuming that Guru knows the answer to everything     
He has mystical powers to solve all our problems     
He can do anything if he desires.     
All these are ours believes what is the substance     
in that is left to an individual’s imagination.    
    
What magic our Guru can do for us is a demonstration.     
What we can do for our Guru is our loyalty towards him.     
How we internally transform with the Guru’s guidance     
and how wisely we live is the real test     
of the knowledge showered upon us.    
    
In the 21st century, we can say any living being is intelligent     
not because he knows everything     
But because he can ask some relevant and deeper questions.     
So, seek the answer and live a conscious, wakeful, and wise life.    
    
May your Guru teach you enough to ask questions     
A question which makes your waking in early morning worth     
A question that is not easy to solve.     
A question not with a wordy answer     
but a question which gives you a new experience of life,     
provided you explore them.    
    
O Chaitanya, I pray to my Guru that may     
you find your Guru on the occasion of this Guru Purnima     
May your path be guided by your Guru’s light     
and you sail your life with that     
profound and great experience     
which takes birth on the bed of the ocean of your awareness.    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat

Until Next Time Remain Blessed

## What is the darkness?    
    
A yearly festival of Deepavali has come     
People are wishing each other,     
Doing the shopping, giving gifts, and receiving gifts.     
People are lighting lamps so that     
the darkness around can be removed.     
This lamp will light for a few hours and days     
and remove the darkness around.    
    
The lamp is radiating a physical light     
and dispatching away physical darkness.     
Physical is that which we can sense with our five senses.    
    
Giving light to some dark room,     
dark street, dark home is a great gift on this occasion.     
This giving we do in the various forms like     
giving business, reviving the economy,     
showing compassion and care, etc.    
    
But there are other kinds of darkness in our life.     
Hopelessness, Helplessness, negativity, jealousy,     
Fear of exploitation, injustice, oppression, slavery,     
Fear of physical, financial, and emotional insecurity     
Fear of loss of health, relation, reputation, and wealth     
Madness to show off, living a flamboyant lifestyle     
All are non-physical darkness of the human mind.    
    
This Deepavali, May we light such lamp     
which can remove this darkness     
from ours and others’ life.    
    
May we distribute such sweet     
which can dissolve the bitterness of relations around.    
    
May we open our arms     
and hug those who are feeling dejected and alone.    
    
May we light a lamp in our thinking     
which makes our home a happy place to live     
and not a godown to store lots of material and gifts     
where we don’t have a place to sit on the ground.    
    
May we do all this not because     
we want to show off to others and selfie.     
Let us do it because we are serious     
for celebrating the festival of Deepavali     
Removing darkness and distributing sweetness.    
    
O Chaitnya! may you get that wisdom in your awareness     
with which you can celebrate your true Deepavali.    
    
Happy Deevapali

# Article5117 : Greetings For New Year 2021    
tags: [ 'Annual Wishes']    
    
## Happy New Year 2021    
    
**How do you wish someone a happy new year?**     
This depends upon with whom we are talking.    
    
There are people who mindlessly speak, walk, eat, and work.     
And there are people who are even     
aware of their every breath at every moment.    
    
**What is meant by Happy New Year?**     
This also depends upon the person     
For some, it has great significant     
and for others, it is just another day of life.    
    
Let me share **my happy new year wishes for friends.**     
As a Meditator, thinker, philosopher     
This is what I encourage you to think.    
    
Earth moves on its axis and     
human observe this movement as     
Day and night, this is a cycle.    
    
The moon rotates around earth and     
human observe full-moon day and no-moon day     
Human count the cycle and name it month     
This is also a cycle.    
    
Earth rotates around the sun and human observe     
change of seasons this is another kind of cycle     
Human counts the cycles and name it as a year.    
    
A women’s body has inbuilt cycles     
These cycles are aligned with the moon’s cycle.     
Our body is an extension of our mother’s body     
Hence our body is also cyclical.    
    
Our sleeping, eating, working all are cyclical.     
Till the time these cycles are aligned     
To nature’s cycle, we are in good health     
The day we are out of sync,     
We have a physical or mental illness.    
    
So human counts the cycle around     
and name it a day, month, year.    
    
When something is cyclical then     
Can we say the cycle start at this time?     
Obviously not! For our convenience     
we say it starts at 12 am, or Monday or January    
    
First January is important for humanity     
Because of interconnected economies and businesses     
Countries which has Economic power celebrates     
Their new year on the first of January, so others follow them.    
    
Ideally speaking, if you consider yourself part of a free nation     
then your Independence day is your new year.     
if you believe in individual evolution     
then your birthday is the new year of your life.     
If you follow some religious or spiritual leader     
then his birthday is the new year of your life.    
    
Whatever is the case     
This is the time to reset the cycle.     
To introspect, what I have done?, what I should do?     
What I was expecting and     
what environment around has given me?     
what have I learned?    
    
When should we do this?     
Some people do it daily, some do it weekly,     
some monthly, some quarterly, some yearly     
and others when they get booted by life.     
There are many people who never do this     
nor understand the importance of this in life.    
    
What we get from nature, government, friends,     
relatives is a matter of time.     
We only can ask or pray and nothing more than that.     
What we can do for these is 100% our choice.     
Let’s do our part in the new year.     
Let’s pray for friends.     
That they get the best physical and mental health.     
They have a compassionate mind and do the right things.     
They achieve their highest potential in the new year.    
    
Until Next Time Remain

# Article5118 : Do I Have Free Will?    
tags: [ Vedanta]    
    
Since the time first life came in the existence,     
It is struggling to establish itself separate     
from the existence, it came from!    
    
Like drop comes out of the ocean     
And it is struggling to establish its Independence from the ocean.     
We all know where the drop has come from     
and what happens to the drop at the end.    
    
Do I have free will?     
The answer for that is Yes and No simultaneously.     
Without being diplomatic or a skilled speaker     
I say this from a state, where I experience, I am not writing this!    
    
Before answering that eternal question of freedom and free will.     
We need to ask ourselves, which I?     
You as a body has a boundary     
You have certain freedom with respect to your body.     
Where to keep it, what to do with it,     
what to eat, where to go, what to talk about.     
But you are not completely free because     
surrounding also control your actions.     
Therefore from the point of the body, you have very limited freedom.    
    
You as a mind, intellect are an emotional being, thinker, etc.     
What you think, feel, and rationalize     
Is all up to you, you have more degree of freedom at this plane of existence.     
But again surrounding also influences our thinking, feeling, etc     
And we experience we don’t have absolute free will.     
But at the mental and intellectual level     
you are better than at the physical level.    
    
Experimentally most of humanity     
knows and realizes its existence at these two levels.     
If you are one of those then sorry for you     
You don’t have free will.     
You are controlled by your spouse, children, government,     
friends, colleagues, clients, bosses, nature, desires, ghosts, etc.     
If something remains to be controlled in you then     
that is controlled by your God, Devi, Devata, Allah, Jesus whatever you prefer.     
Because your belief systems have conditioned you that     
Even leave cannot fall from the tree without the wish of God.     
With that strong conviction, how can you have free will?     
Hence, no question of experiencing “the free will”.    
    
But there is one hope.     
One hope for those, who wish to work hard and think deeper.     
Work hard doesn’t mean physical or emotional or intellectual work.     
But all together in a direction to know “I”ness in your experience.    
    
Till the time you identify yourself with your body,     
objects and relations around this is called     
identification of the self with gross existence around.     
But the moment you wish you know more     
fundamental Tattva, Guna, Characteristic of those objects     
you will start transcending that physicality that is binding you.    
    
To understand the self let’s ponder on this.     
Sun and moon are physical, what is the light?     
Fire is physical, what is the heat?     
Water, milk, oil, is physical, what is the liquidity?     
A flower is physical, what is the smell?     
Cloth, wool is physical, what is the smoothness?    
    
All that we call qualities of the objects are not the objects themselves.     
They are non-physical in nature, not completely non-physical.     
Why? Because they still can be measured using physical types of equipment.    
    
If you know, experience, and identify yourself,     
That is completely non-physical     
That cannot be measured     
That is “Guna” or fundamental substance of the objects     
like the heat is the substance of fire     
Then only there is hope for you to know that you have free will.    
    
And if you always remain in this identification     
Then you will realize you don’t have “a free” will.     
But you are the Will that is supporting existence and cosmos around.    
    
This concept is simple, but difficult to understand for most people.     
But when it comes to realization most fail to experience.     
Rarest in the human breed can experience this     
But rare of the rarest is able to retain this realization     
for a longer period of time or for always.    
    
The question is not how many people realize this free will.     
Neither the question is whether I have free will or not.     
A real question is different.     
Who is “I” of that question which says “Do I have free will”?

# Article5119 : The Way Of Happiness    
tags: [ 'Bhagwat Gita', Education, 'Philosophy for Business', Vedanta]    
    
The Sanskrit term Sukham has multiple     
English translations like happiness, pleasure, joy, etc.    
    
Sukham is the experience of an individual.     
It is your own internal feeling.     
It is not an objective reality outside,     
like any physical thing.     
The objective reality outside has an influence on this feeling     
but for a wise person, it is in his own control that how he wants to feel.    
    
Another Sanskrit term Shanti has English meaning peace.     
Shanti is both, external as well as internal reality.    
    
So, Sukham and Shanti can be experienced     
in your day to day life     
but it depends upon the way you live your life,     
think, transact, and respond.    
    
**Can you imagine Shukham (Joy) without Shanti?**     
Irrespective of what holy books say     
My experience says no.     
And, I hope your experience will not be much different.     
But how to achieve Shanti?     
Or how to live in that constant flood of mental     
stability irrespective of what is thrown upon us or on our people?    
    
To get the answer to the question     
You have to be a professional, expert, and dedicated soul like Arjuna.     
Otherwise answer will go over your head.     
Or you can interpret that differently.    
    
Krishna says in **Bhagwat Gita 12.12**     
mere practicing daily what you already know is good     
But, clarity and knowledge of that are more important.    
    
Not only that, contemplation, meditation, internalization     
of that is more important than     
what you have clarity and knowledge about.    
    
He further says internalization of the knowledge is not enough.     
You have to work with the intention     
that Karmafala of this work is good for society,     
nature, human, or animal lives around.     
He refers to this state of mind as Karmafala Tyaga,     
renunciation of results of Karma.     
Krishna says this Renunciation will lead to Shanti.    
    
Oh Great Warrior, Oh Pratibimba     
Did you get the answer to how to be happy?     
As per Yogeshwar Krishna this the way of Happiness.    
    
Not just working, practicing,     
knowing, praying, running away from problems.     
So face the world and live in Shanti.

# Article5120 : I Don't Know    
tags: [ 'My Views', Philosophy]    
    
When physics is saying 95% of the cosmos is dark matter and dark energy, and what we are analyzing is only 5% of the whole matter and energy. This 5% is made of the atom, which is 99.9999% empty. This empty space is again unknown.    
    
So when we do not know anything about 99.999995% of the existence. In this situation saying the hardware is the basis of intelligence is too early for a science. I think it is safe to say that as a human we don’t know enough. It makes me mad when religious people or believers say that their God and their book have the answer to everything many centuries ago. But if you ask them please help me they refer to some person who they don’t know personally or who is equally illiterate or to a book which they themselves have not read at all or not understood properly.    
    
"I don’t know anything" is the safest point from where one can start one’s journey. Read, ask people, debate but more than that contemplate on the meaning and comprehend. A real seeker should not behave like a full and closed container. Shraddha does not mean believe. Shraddha should help the seeker in asking meaningful and deeper questions, not the surrender of intellect and dulling the mind.

# Article5121 : Meaning Of Understanding    
tags: [ Concepts, Life, 'My Views', Philosophy]    
    
Understanding and knowing are not a binary concept that either your understand or not. This is a spectrum or scale, say moving from zero to hundred. No one has zero understanding about anything, and no matter how many Ph.D. you have on any subject you cannot say I understand this 100%.    
    
How can you tell you have understood it fully? I think there is no way to know that I know X thing or concept 100%.    
    
By knowing all body parts of a human I cannot know human fully.     
By knowing all proteins which makes cell I cannot know human fully.     
By knowing all molecular structures I cannot know humans fully.     
By knowing all biochemistry of humans I cannot understand humans fully.     
By knowing all atomic structures I cannot know humans fully.     
By knowing all subatomic participles and their interactions,     
I cannot know humans fully.     
By knowing all the emotional and mental drama of humans     
I cannot understand humans fully.     
By doing meditation, my mind becomes composed and I am     
ready to know and comprehend but still, I cannot know fully.     
By doing all good activities, I cannot understand fully.     
By doing all moral activities, I cannot understand fully.    
    
Human is a very complicated being.     
You keep a drop of water on your palm and ask yourself     
do you understand it fully?     
If your answer is yes then it only means     
you have not learned how to ask deeper questions.    
    
We pickup any thing or concept around,     
even after so many years on this planet,     
we do not know anything thing fully.    
    
Science helps in understanding things around us to a large extend     
but this too does not go beyond how to make use of something     
and make our life comfortable.    
    
Even after that, humans use these terms frequently.     
I fully understand. I absolutely understand.     
I know it completely.     
They don’t hesitate that there may be     
a possibility of ignorance in this fully understanding.    
    
But still, we have to accept some people     
understand things better than us.     
Why? Because they think more, dwell more     
and are not busy in entertainment,     
and doing some work for livelihood or survival.    
    
Oh Pratibimba, What do you know about understanding?

# Article5122 : Don't Be Afraid Of Covid    
tags: [ Education, Life, Mind, 'My Views', Nature, Philosophy]    
    
We are a body of 15 trillion cells.     
The human body is a colony of billions of viruses and bacterias.     
Every day with food, water, and the air we consume those.     
And they sustain our bodies.     
That is why a newborn baby’s body becomes     
5 feet or 6 feet in a span of 15 or 20 years.    
    
We have a system that knows what to keep inside and how long.     
What to throw out and when.     
But this system doesn’t work on our whims or fancies.     
Neither it works on how many chemicals medicines we consume.     
Nor it works on how much you have in the bank account.     
Neither it works on how many likes or dislikes we get on social media or society.     
Nor it works on how many hours you do pooja, namaz, or prayer.     
Neither it works on how many temple or churches you visit.     
Nor it works on how many awards or properties you have.    
    
It works as nature has designed our body.     
We are not here to live for always.     
Everyone shall pass without fail.     
But we shouldn’t fail because of our own foolishness.     
At least now pay attention and learn,     
how we survive with so many viruses and bacterias.    
    
Even if so-called good thing remains in the system for long term     
it is not good for the body.     
Learn to recycle this with nature.     
Thank god our breathing system, blood circulation system,     
the digestive system works properly to cooperate with nature.     
If it is out of sync because of any reason then     
the body falls sick and collapse within no time.    
    
Welcome corona in your body as any other virus.     
Do enough cleaning of your body so that your body     
learns how to throw this out every day.    
    
If you wish corona shouldn’t happen to you that is not possible.     
If you wish you get repair automatically that may not happen.     
The only right thing at this time is daily Tapasya and wakeful living.     
Keep your body, cloth, surroundings internally and externally cleaning.    
    
We are a society that always aspired to run towards America and Europe     
And today we are asking where are oxygen cylinders and hospitals?     
When we don’t care about our nation     
and our people then what else we deserve     
than today’s health infrastructure.    
    
We are a society that always aspired to go west for higher education.     
Today all the world-class universities are available online.     
You can study from anywhere.     
Most of them offer free courses and     
charging only for degrees and certificates.     
Don’t run away, work hard and build the nation and society now.    
    
We are a nation that aspired for foreign tours     
without knowing the wealth of our own culture.     
Today we are realizing even after so many differences,     
lack of resources, diversity India is the best place to live.    
    
We are such a society that after 70 years of independence     
Our prime minister need to drive     
a massive Swacchata Abhiyan for cleanly awareness.    
    
Even those who were clean at body     
they do not bother about their dustbin.     
Those, whose dustbin is clean throw garbage on road.     
Sometimes the body is clean     
but the mind is filled with so many negative thoughts     
then people need to watch joker’s channels     
to keep them in a joyful state!    
    
What is happening?     
We don’t know how to clean and healthy on our own!     
For the body we need chemicals and for the mind we need jockers!    
    
This is the time to learn about making     
our body system, mental systems, psychological systems,     
social, political, and economic systems strong.    
    
I am sure by the time Corona comes under our control     
we will be a much better and stronger society.     
The only question is who will survive to see that society!     
No one knows that answer.     
But don’t worry too much about that which you don’t know.    
    
O Pratibimba, Keep your system clean at every level of existence     
every day, every moment.     
Don’t run away from the news.     
Avoid propaganda and exaggerations.     
News is not negative, our mind has become negative for certain things.     
Or our mind has become weak to handle     
the emotional trauma happening around us.     
See everything, have empathy and compassion.     
If you can work, donate and help please do so.     
But never be negative.     
There are very good days ahead for     
our future generation and our nation.

# Article5123 : Boring Maths and Science    
tags: [ 'My Views']    
    
Generally people like music, art, dance but not maths or physics. Why? Because people live art, music, and dance so it flows from their life, and people around them receive it like water flowing from a fountain.    
    
But the lovers of maths and physics have not learned to live maths and physics. So, these people look serious and dry. Nothing enough flows from their life that others can receive. But is maths and physics really like that? The answer is a big no! Both are extremely beautiful in fact they can engross your mind much more than any music or dance can. It is a matter of a good teacher around or a deep zeal to learn yourself.    
    
## Mathematics is more than Number    
    
Mathematics is not just about numbers, it starts with numbers. It is a human’s language to understand the working of nature. Like all humans can understand emoticons, all who are interested in deepening their understanding about nature and want to model it understand mathematics. Books of physics are written using the letters borrowed from mathematics.    
    
Without maths there is no physics. Without physics, there is no engineering. Without tools and engineering, there is no medical. Then whatever left is art. But that also you cannot do good without basic Maths!

# Article5124 : Cause Of Pain And Suffering    
tags: [ Life, Mind, 'My Views', Philosophy]    
    
I am a body.     
Therefore I must have pain and comfort.     
And I can cause pain and comfort for others.    
    
I am a mind.     
Therefore I feel love and hate for others.     
Hence I feel enjoyment and suffering.     
And as a mind, I can cause enjoyment and suffering for others.    
    
I am an intellect.     
Therefore I can win and lose in arguments.     
I can help other in learning and confuse others.     
And an a intellect, clarity and confusion are to me.    
    
If I know myself truly without body, mind and intellect     
then what pain, comfort, suffering, enjoyment, win, and lose     
I can have and cause to others?    
    
But people saying I am Atman is foolish and bookish.     
If people know they are Atman then     
where is the place for these bodily and mental experiences?    
    
This is what Arjuna’s Friend saying Mithyachari.     
Aachaar (behavior) of Mithya (that which seems but not there).     
In plain English Hypocrisy.

# Article5125 : Do We Have A Free Will    
tags: [ Mind, 'My Views', Philosophy, Vedanta]    
    
Religion says there is no free will. Without God’s will, nothing happens. So if there is any free will that is of God. Man is a slave.    
    
Science says everything can be predicted based on the parameters and a good quality model. If a model is good quality and all parameters are given as an input then what you will eat, where you will go, when will you sleep, what you will buy, when you will drink, etc everything can be predicted precisely. AI and ML is proving this. So, ultimately, science is also saying human is a slave and doesn’t have any free will.    
    
A spiritual person says I don’t know for sure, whether God exists or not but I am sure that I am not just a heap of food, ideas, and emotions that science is telling me. But I am much more than that physical nature of my existence. I am responsible for my actions. Rewards and punishment both are for me. What I do using my body and mind I must bear the consequences. It is about responsibility.    
    
When someone is irresponsible either they throw everything on God like religious people do or they throw everything on their compulsiveness like scientists say that you are a complex wave function of billions of parameters what you will do next already decided by your parameters and wave function.    
    
In Corona times or otherwise what you think about yourself at least that is your free. will.

# Article5126 : Human Compulsiveness    
tags: [ Education, 'Ethics and Morality', Mindfulness, 'My Views', Philosophy]    
    
Compulsiveness is slavery. Generally people people confuse this with their freedom.    
    
Let’s say one has a desire to eat or walk or talk or, watch TV, or for that matter do any so-called good or bad activity. If one can do that activity successfully as per one’s satisfaction then one thinks he exercised his freedom to ‘think’ and to ‘do’.    
    
Most of the time this so-called freedom is compulsiveness. It is coming from our deep-rooted behavior and condition mind. In nutshell called Svabhava.    
    
How do you know it is freedom or compulsiveness? After performing an activity or after not able to perform an activity if you experience out of balance in your mind. Itchiness of mind is ‘oh yes, I have done it’ or ‘oh sad, I could not do that. If one is feeling too happy or too sad then it is was definitely one’s compulsiveness.    
    
In the name of freedom, we are slaves of our senses, conditioned mind, and society/environment around us.    
    
A human mind can develop a feature called Samatvam. Remain in the physical world and not get dragged by the activities of it.    
    
We are not free even when we think we are remembering God that is another kind of compulsiveness. Just see around how people do Puja or Bhajan, without emotions without involvement! And how they live with children and family, completely sucked.    
    
O Chaitnya, how to develop that mind of Samatvam which is driven by Dharma (fundamental responsibilities of relationships with people and objects around)? How, not to take our job, life, relationships, god, money, possessions, etc. so seriously that when they are with us we want distance, and when they leave us we are too sad?

# Article5127 : Knocking Your Own Door    
tags: [ Mind, 'My Views', Philosophy]    
    
When you live alone in a house and due to some reason go out then after coming back to your door you should not ring the doorbell as you do when we go to other’s hours. We open the door. Nobody will open your door from inside because the insider has gone out and there is no one inside. We all understand this simple logic but when we need to apply this to our spiritual dimension of living we fail.    
    
We have gone too much outside in the world and are not able to enter into our kingdom of happiness and waiting for somebody will open the door from inside. This is not going to happen.    
    
Either you don’t go out or go out with a key, and when coming back use the key to enter the house. Hoping others will open this door for us is an illusion. They can create another house for you outside of your door but cannot open your house from inside. Guru or your God doesn’t open your door but helps you find you open your keys so that you can enter inside. But there are enough who are not interested in knowing about the key or opening the door.    
    
Are you still waiting for someone else to open the door for your freedom and happiness?

# Article5128 : Thinking In Human Vs Computers    
tags: [ 'My Views']    
    
If a computer says I am thinking then what does it mean? It is speaking out the word which has been programmed in it by humans? Or, the processor is too busy because of some calculation or searching and hence this is status? Or is it really contemplating the meaning of words like humans do?    
    
The beauty is many times solution comes from humans when they wake up after a deep sound sleep. Can a computer give us a solution after a long rest? Answer is no.    
    
Computers think and processes. But we humans have a tendency to relate every concept to our life. The way we look, think, behave, interact, buy, throw, value, abuse, praise, love etc the same way machines or even our so called God should do!!! That is childish.    
    
Finally, if something is difficult for humans that doesn’t mean it is difficult for computers as well. Neither something simple for humans menas simple for machines as well.    
    
# Article5129 : What Test To Know The Self?    
tags: [ Life, Philosophy]    
    
Every object around us including our body has two kinds of properties physical properties like color, mass, density, shape, size, etc., and chemical properties like object are poison, acid, base, the reaction of an object when mixed with other objects, etc.    
    
Whatever we experience around in the physical world is because of these two types of properties. So we have physical tests and chemical tests. What we experience mentally is also an extension of these two tests, either we recall tests from the past or we project them in the future.    
    
You cannot understand anything fully just by physical test, nor you can know fully just by chemical test. For example, you have a special shape leaf before you. You never saw this kind of leaf before. Now, you want to know, this is a leaf of what kind of plant? What kind of flower or fruit that plant has? Whether this leaf eatable or not? What medicinal value this leaf has etc.? For that full Knowledge, you have to perform a range of physical and chemical tests.    
    
O Chaitanya! what test need to be performed to know the self?

# Article5130 : Shraddha On Guru    
tags: [ Guru, Poetry]    
    
## Guru Purnima 2021    
    
Darkness was prevalent all over     
Because it was dark everywhere outside     
There was no light physical.    
    
Darkness was prevalent all over     
Because it was dark in society.     
People were deluded,     
They were not able to identify     
what is right or wrong for them.     
They are not able to choose     
between right and wrong for others.    
    
Darkness was there     
But what kind of darkness was that?     
Was it because there was no light?     
Or we refused to open our eyes and see in the light?     
Or we are too scared to open our eyes and see the world around us?     
Or we are too scared to see ourselves in the mirror?    
    
The darkness of all kinds created fear in me.     
Fear of doing something, fear of not doing.     
Fear of losing somethings and     
Fear and of not getting something that I wish.     
Fear of death and fear of defeat.    
    
From our childhood till our death these fears     
of different types are prevalent in human life.     
Grade and quality of the fear may change     
at different stages of life but they remain.    
    
Nature of fear may change     
An object from which we fear may change     
But the fear of losing, suffering, pain,     
and death always keeps traveling with humans.    
    
Ignorance is the bliss is well known saying     
Less you know less is the fear.     
See your pets and trees around     
They also have life     
but they live with little knowledge.     
For them, survival is the only challenge     
With that limited knowledge they live.    
    
Their ignorance may be bliss for them     
Because they don’t have the capability to know,     
Ability to explore and research     
Ability to create philosophy, art, music, and science.     
Ability to reason, write and defend.     
Ability to create societies and economy.     
Ability to create friends and foes     
Ability to create weapons, and construct a dam.     
Ability to give life for a cause     
A cause of religion, family, society, nation, and humanity.    
    
For human ignorance is sin     
For humans fear is death     
For human inaction and indecisiveness are action and decision.     
For humans not able to reason properly     
creates chaos, confusion, and mental sickness.    
    
The light which sucks all my fear in a moment     
The light that gives me the confidence to stand and walk     
That light is the light of Guru.    
    
Initially this light dawn upon us as Mother and Father.     
This is the light of the **First Guru**.     
But our desire to roam and see the world around     
Cannot be fulfilled by that one light.    
    
We want to know more, explore more     
Then the light of our Teachers guides us     
through various subjects in schools and colleges.     
Because of this **Second light**, we make relations and     
expands the world around us     
We make our living because of this light.    
    
To grow in social, political, or professional life     
we need a coach or mentor to guide us.     
That light of the **third Guru** helps us to sail smoothly     
in the dense forest of social, political, and corporate life.     
Unfortunately, most of us do not get his Third light.     
and hence most of us struggle alone     
in corporate, social, or political life.    
    
But the world starts becoming more complex.     
We start realizing money is not solving problem.     
On the contrary, money is creating problems.    
    
More the crowd more lonely we feel.     
When our own people start looking strange to us.     
Endless traveling is causing tiredness     
and not giving us freshness.    
    
We start feeling even after traveling all around the world     
I am still not a peaceful being.     
Neither contented and happy human being.    
    
Even after knowing so much and earning so much     
I cannot sit in one place for ten minutes.     
My body has become like a donkey     
it needs the burden of some work all the time.    
    
My mind has become a monkey     
who needs some idea to dance upon all the time.     
Or people around to entertain me.    
    
Having a healthy body is good but     
Having a peaceful mind is great.     
And the greatest is having an intellect     
that can reason properly all the time.    
    
During the journey of life when we gain we lose also.     
What is that light which can make me aware of this loss and gain?     
What is that light which makes me aware of right and wrong,     
ethical and unethical, moral or immoral?    
    
This Fourth light is the light of the **Fourth Guru**.     
A spiritual being.     
Who never bothered about his possession and kingdom.     
Who never bothered about his haves and have nots.     
Who never bothers about his gains and losses.     
But always cares for the direction of my travel.     
Cares for the path of Dharma in my life.     
     
But why someone will care for me so much?     
That too without expecting anything physical in return.     
Nothing is free in this world.     
This happens because I have unflinching Shraddha on my Guru.    
    
A Shraddha that he is wise and experienced.     
A Shraddha that he will never misguide me.     
A Shraddha that he will never cheat me and put me in unnecessary trouble.     
A Shraddha that he is my ultimate well-wisher.     
A Shraddha that he is my companion of life and beyond.     
A Shraddha that he is doing all for my upliftment    
    
O Chaitnya, could you find your **fourth Guru** in your life?     
Some feel it is not required.     
Some feel it is not easy.     
Some feel they don’t exist.     
Some feel in Kalyug your Bhagwan is your Guru.     
Some feel in Kalyug your Guru is your Bhagwan.     
There are experiences of different individuals.    
    
But blessed are those who could get     
one such companion in their life.     
Before that Guru people do not cry for money, wife,     
husband, children, job, power, win, lose     
But Guru’s silent presence is enough.    
    
These are the words of my Shraddha at the feet of those Gurus     
whose guidance protected my mind and my Dharma.     
Whose presence never let me feel alone.     
Whose work motivated me to live a sensible life.     
Who inspires me to work tirelessly for Moksha,     
hence to get that knowledge     
with which I am losing my shackles     
which were binding me to ignorance and     
eternal cycles birth and death, pain and pleasure.

# Article5131 : What Is Balance Food Diet?    
tags: [ Concepts, 'Ethics and Morality', 'My Views']    
    
Food, sex, religion, and politics are four topics where everyone has his own experience, a perspective of looking into, and a view about.    
    
Here I am putting My view about food. If you disagree with my views, then I would love to listen and learn more from every thinking man and woman.    
    
Human is a thinking animal, a human can think, and it helps human to understand the environment better and adapt to the environment. Other than if we think a human is God created special life on this planet etc. that is all our personal belief. No one knows the truth, it is an internal debate, so better move to the topic of food.    
    
Go into an open environment like a forest or park and watch insects, birds, reptiles, and animals. Look what they eat and how they survive. Do they struggle to choose between what to eat and what not? They know their food very well. How? Because of their design! The design of their intestine, mouth, teeth, tongue, etc. tells them what will help in surviving and what not. So they eat what is fit for them. You can this any technical name like nature, Swabhav, etc., but ultimately it is their design.    
    
You will rarely see a non-vegetarian cow, goat, deer, etc. Likewise, you will rarely see a vegetarian lion, bear, leopard, etc. I am saying rarely because exceptions are there in nature and people can dig the hole even in sound logic. For that, what they need is an exception!    
    
To survive, every life needs a balanced diet of vitamins, carbohydrates, fat, protein, etc. It is not that only humans need it. Ask yourself from where a pure vegetarian animal gets all these components for living a healthy life? Did you find a protein or vitamin deficit in cows, goats, or lions? If yes, then did you recommend them to keep on a different diet so that their deficiency problem can be addressed. Even before we have these high-tech English words, life on this planet is existing for many millennia.    
    
Now the question is what is good for humans? The answer is in another question. Why human is struggling so much to determine this? Especially when every creature on the planet knows what to eat when to eat, how to eat. How come only human is confused?    
    
I think the answer is we don’t observe enough and don’t think deeper. We are rational beings, so we use intellect to justify whatever we like or hate. Animals never had that luxury.    
    
Look yourself in the mirror, ask yourself are your teeth, tongue, and mouth design anything like lion or cow. Is your intestine like a cow or lion? Herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores have different body designs.    
    
Because of cultural reasons, we attach food to religion, but for a thinking person, food shouldn’t be a religious issue. You have taste buds for something, and you want to eat something. For that, we take the help of religion or science. People put the arguments of protein, vitamins, carbohydrates from science books without realizing that other creatures are also living a healthy life without reading diet charts. How come, only humans need to eat something which is not his or her design. When they put a daily diet chart of protein, carbohydrates, vitamins before me, I always laugh at that. I say you eat whatever you’re convinced of, don’t try to justify that with this western science’s balance dietary chart, after all, human has the intellect to justify everything.    
    
Based on the food available around, humans had adapted themselves accordingly. There are still humans who eat raw animals and insects to survive because agriculture is possible only when there is civilization and culture. When agriculture evolved, the human design also changed over the period.    
    
But humans still give that logic of balancing their diet by eating something which is coming from animals. Some are limited to milk and dairy items and some go to the extent of killing and eating animals. Some do this in the name of religion, some in the name of science.    
    
Oh Pratibimba! Will human being ever obverse, think, and do?    
    
Or always do and reason his or her desire, actions?    
    
# Article5132 : Choose Your Attitude    
tags: [ 'My Views', Philosophy]    
    
The world around us is either a warfield or playground.     
If it is warfield then we keep fighting.     
If it is a playground, then we keep playing.     
If we are interested in doing karma then     
these are two kinds of Karma options before us.     
In one karma one gets exhausted and wants to quit,     
in another one enjoys and wants to continue the game.    
    
Apart from that if we assume we have some     
God given goal, responsibility, purpose, etc.     
that is our self owned extra material     
it can help us fight or play better and with a different attitude.    
    
Life is a struggle, fighting, and survival issue for those     
who see the forest around and find themselves in the forest.     
Life is play for those who find all are my friends around     
there is no competition, there is no rival, there is no enemy.     
There is a game, winning or losing is not important.     
Play is important.     
There is no enemy or rival,     
but we have an opponent on the ground.     
We need to play to keep the game interesting     
and not for defeating or winning others.    
    
In our playfulness, we harm lesser to the environment and ourselves.     
While in a fight, we get injured and cause more injury,     
irrespective of our fighting skills.     
In Hinduism, we say Devas does Leela (play) and     
Asura do yuddha (fight).     
That is why we say Bhagwan ki Leela.     
We never say Asuron ki Leela.     
What attitude we choose for the world around us     
and for life is 100% our choice.     
     
Oh Chaitanya, just go and play     
all are children of the same mother earth.     
Some are crocked, some are nice.     
But don’t spoil your game because of some bad player.

# Article5133 : Equation Of Arjunas Arrows    
tags: [ 'Indian Culture', 'Indian Sciences']    
    
## Arjuna’s Arrows and Algebra (Beejganit)!    
    
Bhāskarāchārya (1114 -1185 CE), has been called the greatest mathematician of medieval India. And is considered the progenitor of Differential Calculus. He was 500 years before Newton and Leibniz!    
    
Bhāskarāchārya wrote at least four mathematical treatises in Sanskrit. One of them, titled [Leelavati](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13dHKOYI3sofLWdUbTQt3SLv7cFCdeOqa/view?usp=sharing), contains many algebra-related teasers, which have become the subject of significant research by scholars. These teasers are in the form of shlokas which pose the problems. The shlokas need to be interpreted correctly to decipher the meaning in order to find the solution.    
    
In the 70th Shloka of Leelavati, we see equations related to Arjuna’s Arrow.    
    
पार्थ: कर्णवधाय मार्गणगणं क्रुद्धो रणे संदधे     
तस्यार्धेन निवार्य तच्छरगणं मूलैश्चतुभिर्हयान् |     
शल्यं षड्भिरथेषुभिस्त्रिभिरपि च्छत्रं ध्वजं कार्मुकम्     
चिच्छेदास्य शिरः शरेण कति ते यानर्जुनः संदधे || 70 ||    
    
The direct meaning of this shloka is a question formulated as follows:    
    
During the battle between Arjuna and Karna in the Mahabharata, Arjuna released some arrows, out of the released arrows:    
    
- Half were consumed in stopping the arrows coming from Karna.    
- 4 times the square root of the arrows were consumed to control the horses of Karna’s chariot    
- Six were for gaining control over Shalya, the charioteer of Karna. (Shalya was the maternal uncle of Nakula and Sahadeva)    
- Three were used to take on the umbrella and flag of the chariot and the bow of Karna.    
- Finally, Karna was killed by a single arrow. So how many arrows were released by Arjuna in the battle?    
    
If we formulate this equation correctly, then the basic algebra easily yields the answer to this question,    
    
X = X/2 + 4√X + 6 + 3 + 1    
    
Solving the above, we get the value of X=100 for the total number of arrows shot by Arjuna.    
    
# Article5134 : Universal Culture    
tags: [ Concepts, Education, 'Indian Culture']    
    
All humans have the same body structure eyes, ears, hands, feet, etc., except very few gender level differences. We make this little difference of the body so much that it becomes a gender issue. It looks like a huge issue as if men and women are coming from different planets, or they are made of different materials. On this little difference, we have issues of feminism, patriarchy, etc. But leaving that little difference aside, **there are many differences at the non-physical level which are non-trivial**, and they are much more important differences than the physical difference of males and females.    
    
Just think **why do people, societies, and nations argue, fight and go to war?** Not because of physical level differences. They enter there because of some reasons, and these reasons come from emotion. When you feel strongly about something, you want others to follow that. When someone attacks you, then you defend yourself. Not only defends, sometimes you crazily attack someone who does not have similar emotions as you. Sometimes these attacks are physical, sometimes emotional, and other times verbal.    
    
But, **what is at the root of emotion and feelings**? Value system, principle, ideology are the seat of emotions. Humans are the construct of these. Our education system and upbringing alter this and have a huge influence on these. That is why when one civilization wants to win over another the hard method is war, but the soft method is to change the education system.    
    
Culture is that concept which shapes individual human and human societies. But, **what is culture**? It has nothing to do with your physical differences or skin color. It is deeper. The language which you use to communicate, the agriculture, fruits you cultivate, the food you eat or serve are part of your culture. Your attitude towards your own relatives, friends, society is part of the culture. Your attitude towards other food and society etc. are components of your culture.    
    
One of the key components of the culture, which I noticed prominently, is **how you greet people**. How do you greet your known and unknown? How do you greet elders, youngers, same age people and children? How do you greet known and unknown people of the opposite gender? If you are a little serious **student of humanity, culture, and civilizational studies** then you would notice how Japanese, Chinese, Arabs, Europeans, and Indians greet. All are complete differently and with different emotions.    
    
Another extension of the greeting is the way you address other people. How do you address known people, unknown people, known/unknown people of the opposite gender, elders, parents, teachers, brothers, and sisters?    
    
Broadly if you observe cultures around you will notice **Western, Chinese, Japanese, Arab, and Indians have their own unique way of addressing.** In Indian society, although we have many languages yet huge importance has been given to establish a relationship with a person before you address him. There are many unique names for each relation like Mata, Pita, Bhrata/Bhai, Bahin/Bhagini, Didi, Mitra, Sakha/Sakhi, Chacha, Chachi, Bua, Mama, Mami, Fufa, Fufi, Sasur, Sasu Maa, Dada, Dadi, Nana, Nani, Guru, Guru Maa, Bhabhi, Jija, etc. this list goes very long. Thus, when you address someone, we primarily address with these unique words assigned to relations. With this also, we give so much respect that we put the suffix “Ji” with every relation.    
    
**Another extension to the greeting is the emotions** that you have in your heart while addressing another person. These emotions are governed by our culture. Ram, Sita, and Laxman are gods for many people, but for many of the people, they are ideal of human life. **There is not even one week difference between Ram’s and Laxman’s age**, but still, Laxman refers to Sita Ji as his mother. Because in our culture it told that friend’s wife or elder brother’s wife should be treated as mother. Younger’s brother’s wife should be treated as a sister. Establish a relationship with the opposite gender so that you don’t become unknown and inaccessible to her/him. Maintain a relationship of mutual trust and respect.    
    
**Recent excessive Westernization of Indian culture has finished all the relationships** and all the emotions behind these relations. Now you have only 9 relations mom, dad, uncle, aunt, bro, sis, friend, grandpa, grandmom. We have killed all other relations and people even do not know those names. As westerners, we started calling all people around by their first name, without realizing their age, our relationship with them, their seniority, their gender, etc.    
    
Now in Indian urban families, there are only 5 greetings methods namely hi, hello, good morning good afternoon, and good night. And without paying attention, people think it means the same as Namaste, Namaskar, Jai Siya Ram, Pranam, Pailagu, Dandvat Pranaam etc. Nowadays, people are so much confused that they don’t know what needs to be done when. So the easiest way is to say hi.    
    
[The meaning of Namaste](/wiaposts/the-meaning-of-namaste/)    
    
There are only two titles now, sir and madam. People don’t know how we were giving respect in our culture. Perhaps old people remember that if someone asks you your father, mother, or guru’s name you must put Shri, Shriman, or Shrimati before uttering their actual name. How people were addressing unknown people in the assembly of king or panchayat? Perhaps you forgot. Mahodaya, Shriman Ji, Shrimati Ji, Bandhu, Bhagini, Brata, Maharaj are just a few ways. People think sir and madam are easiest, and it is the same as our own culture.    
    
If you understood my point, then what will you call this? Annihilation of culture? You couldn’t value your culture, so you couldn’t export it. You valued other’s cultures, and you imported that heavily. Now in the name of an educated family, cultured family what we see is the Homogenization of culture!    
    
If you think that if our world has only one religion, one language, one culture, one currency, same wealth for all, same cloth for all, same food for all, same god for all then you are talking about the animal kingdom. All lions or cows or buffalo or deer or mouse looks the same in the forest.    
    
I think culture is very important for humans without that he or she is an animal. But which culture? Can there be one universal culture? I think if someone has a dream of one culture, one rule for the whole of humanity, then that idea is most dangerous. It means cultural genocide of others.    
    
So what is the solution? Know your culture, follow that, greet others as per their culture, and mutual respect for each other’s culture.

## When Sir MV blackmailed DVG    
    
Sir M Visvesvaraiah was the Dewan of the Mysore State from 1912 to 1918. Sir MV, as he was popularly known, had a fairly large circle of friends and among them was eminent Kannada writer and thinker D V Gundappa (DVG).    
    
DVG was not merely a writer but was also a journalist, eminent thinker, and a visionary. In 1945, he set up the Gokhale Institute of Public Affairs in NR Colony, Bangalore, and he was instrumental in beginning the Popular Education League and the Social Service League.    
    
DVG was a close friend and associate of Sir MV. There were many times when Sir MV would either invite DVG over for discussions on State policies and other affairs of the Mysore State.    
    
The discussions were helpful to Sir MV in taking decisions or coming up with a policy. Over time, the discussions became longer, took on a more serious note and the result led to the adoption of several radical changes in the State administration.    
    
Ever the gentleman, Sir MV had no qualms about acknowledging the credit to DVG. This was in the mid 1920s and DVG was not in a very sound financial position. Yet, he neither sought favors nor accepted any from any person or organization.    
    
It was then that Sir MV decided to do something to his friend. He first broached the idea of an allowance for DVG for “picking” his brains and helping the State come to a decision. A proud DVG outrightly refused.    
    
DVG pointed out that the discussions were between friends, and they could not be measured in monetary terms. Moreover, he was a journalist, and he could not afford to take money from the Government, however benevolent it may be.    
    
Sir MV then suggested that DVG could accept the appointment as a Consultant to the Mysore Government and in return, he would be paid a certain amount. DVG trashed the idea and steadfastly refused to reconsider his decision of not taking any amount from the Government.    
    
DVG pointedly told Sir MV that he disliked the idea of taking money for discussing issues with his friend. Try as much as he could, Sir MV failed to budge DVG.    
    
Sir MV then told DVG that, henceforth, their conversation would be limited only to family and personal matters and no other topic would be discussed. A reluctant DVG agreed, but soon he found himself starved of the intellectual companionship of Sir MV. It was now the turn of DVG to cajole Sir MV to get back to the scholarly interactions that had become so important part of their daily routine.    
    
Sir MV then realized that he had DVG where he wanted. He promised to continue the serious and scholarly debates and discussions provided DVG became a consultant to the State. DVG agreed, and soon both were back to their scholarly best.    
    
The regular discussions helped Sir MV formulate State policy and also in governance. He ensured that DVG would be paid for the discussions, and the then Mysore State Treasury (it was then called Huzur Treasury) issued cheques to DVG.    
    
Sir MV passed away in 1962 and DVG in 1975. When a trunk belonging to DVG was opened shortly after his passing, there were several cheques issued from the Treasury that had been kept uncashed.    
    
These were the cheques issued on the insistence of Sir MV but DVG had no intention of encashing them, he accepted them and kept them locked away in a trunk. The total amount in the cheques ran to lakhs.    
    
Neither of these men was after money or fame. Yet, today, they are remembered by one and all. One is remembered for his engineering skills, the other is known for his “Mankutimmana-Kagga”, a rare piece of art in the otherwise dry world of literature.    
    
Both the engineering skills of Sir MV and the Kagga of DVG have survived.    
    
This is a great example of value-based true friendship. Even if one is serious about this kind of friendship, it is not easy to get this kind of partner friend. One needs grace to happen in one’s life.

# Article5138 : Who Is The Creator?    
tags: [ Philosophy, Vedanta]    
    
Namaste,     
    
Faith can move mountains, but faith should be well-founded,     
and you should be able to wait for enough.     
If the faith in something moves mountains someday then     
it doesn’t mean the object on which have faith has done that miracle.     
It also means that you have the power to move mountains.     
Act may be physical or mental.     
Your emotions have the power     
to synchronize with the vibration of the mountain     
and when you both are in sync     
you can create constructive or destructive patterns of waves     
and either smash the mountain, move it or invert it.     
It looks impossible in classical physics,     
but from quantum physics, all this is possible.     
The only thing is, we don’t know enough about     
how to control and be in sync with the cosmos.     
     
Yogi tries to do that and find results that are very encouraging.     
That is why, in the yogic systems,     
the concept of Tantra and Siddhi is so famous.     
It is different that because of poor understanding     
or fainted will power people cannot take that kind of     
life long task in their hand     
and believe all is a mental concoction.     
On top of that in this fast-moving technology world     
Who has time and lifelong commitment     
for experimenting with these ideas?    
    
Whatever you know that you know from     
your senses, mind, and intellect.     
You shut them down, there is no way to know.     
This is true for every life, insect, or animal, or human.     
What is the reality around? No one knows.     
A rose is red or white, we know because of eyes and mind.     
Food is sweet or sour, we know from tongue and mind.     
Music is good or rough, we know from ear and mind.     
Cloth is soft or hard, we know from skin and mind.     
A person is a friend or enemy we know from memory and analysis.    
    
So our nervous system is designed in such a way that     
all our sensory inputs are carried to the brain.     
It refers to certain local memories,     
processes, comprehend, and know the world around.     
This is the physical way of knowing.     
This is good for physical survival.    
    
You believe in the energy system or God or the devil.     
It is your belief.     
What you see is your creation or creator’s creation?     
It is not easy to know this.     
Why? Because the nature of the mind is like that!    
    
You go before a mirror and ask who is that.     
The answer you get is, it is me.     
But the reality is, that is your reflection, not you.     
You see through the eyes, but you cannot see eyes.     
Even before the mirror, you get an idea about eyes,     
but you cannot see your real eyes. Why?     
The nature of existence is like that.     
Seer can never ever see himself or herself.     
You can extend that logic a little further,     
and you will know the knower knows everything but himself,     
Experiencer experience everything but himself.    
    
Who is that knower?     
Even intellectual people, yoga practitioners, and philosophers puzzle over it.     
They think it is energy.     
So they say I am energy, I am light, I am love etc.     
So they know themselves with these attributes.     
But if you apply previous logic, then you will understand     
this is the knower’s perception about the reality around,     
It is neither a reality nor it is that experiencer     
who is experiencing light or energy or love!    
    
In physics, there is no difference between mass and energy.     
They both are one and the same thing.     
They keep interchanging and keep creating     
the world around and within our body.     
Food becomes energy and life survives for one more day.     
Wood burns and it becomes heat and light.     
Wood mass transforms into light and energy.    
    
The question is that who does all these transformations?     
That transformer is not a subjective reality but an objective one.     
That is not energy.     
That is beyond your comprehension and experience.     
But it is there.     
     
Religious people say it is God.     
Spiritual people say it is spirit or soul.     
Modern-day scientists say it is energy or force.     
Fanatic says it is my God.     
Yogi says I don’t know, but I experience that something is there.     
Advaita Vedantin says I am that transformer.     
But don’t get me wrong     
I am not that who is speaker,     
nor that who is listening,     
I am not the body, nor energy, nor mind,     
nor intellect, nor emotions, not god, not devil,     
not earth nor water nor fire nor air nor space.     
But the creator of space in which all the phenomena happens.     
     
Oh Chaitanya, you are that creator, transformer     
Know yourself as non-physical.

# Article5139 : What Is Love?    
tags: [ 'My Views', Philosophy, 'Pleasure & Joy']    
    
Namaste,    
    
Normally people think love is between opposite genders.     
Some people think love is about sex.     
There are enough minds who don’t perceive     
any difference between this four-letter word     
and another four-letter English word.     
You know what I mean.     
Other people say I love shopping.     
There are some who say I love eating, sleeping, dancing.    
    
People say they fall in love.     
Some others say they are crushed by love.     
There are some who feel cheated and robbed in love.    
    
People say love is blind.     
There are people who feel love happens between equals.     
Some people say love can spoil you, so be cautious.    
    
Some say love is Bhakti.     
Others say in love, we surrender completely.     
Some say love is unconditional.     
Business people say love is a transaction.    
    
Life exists at multiple levels.     
Like onion has many layers     
And each layer is made of different color, size, smell, geometry     
All layers make that onion     
Remove all layers, there is no physical entity called onion.    
    
Life exists at multiple levels.     
Physical, Emotional, Intellectual, and Energy     
Each layer is complex enough.     
Each layer has its own function and contribution to our existence.     
Which layer you experience more     
that depends on how deeper you could dive into     
the existential ocean called cosmos or life.    
    
Love is a force of attraction.     
Love is a force of nature.     
When you see clouds dancing on the chest of a mountain they are in love.     
When you see Chataka bird does not drink water     
and wait for a drop of water from rain. She is in love.     
When a sunflower aligns herself toward the sun that is love.    
    
When farmer sow some seed in the earth     
and nurture the earth with his love     
Then earth returns a plant     
That is the exchange of love.     
That is why the earth is called mother     
and Farmer is called father.    
    
When you throw something above     
And it falls back to earth     
It is because of the attraction of earth called love.    
    
When you behave appropriately with animals     
They become harmless for you     
That is the power of your love.    
    
When you think you are giving more and other is giving less     
Your love is moving towards a transaction.     
When you say “I love you” then peep inside     
there are chances you are not feeling it.     
When you feel the loss of words     
but overflowing energy from within     
there is high chance you are in Love.    
    
To love you don’t need love from others     
Love is your capacity and capability     
It doesn’t become less or more within you     
because of other person’s behavior     
When you are empty or have less feeling of love     
then, a miser is your guide, you want to give little by little     
only at those places from where you get it equal or more.    
    
When you say I cannot live without you     
That is the crutch of dependence, not love.     
Some love this kind of crutch.    
    
When some say I love only you     
And you both believe in that statement     
There are chances you both have not     
understood the meaning of     
that word as existential reality.    
    
When you see a beautiful flower in someone’s garden     
Then given an opportunity what do you of that flower?     
You fall in love!     
After some time you pluck it from the branch.     
Keep in your pocket,     
Or offer at the feet of your God     
Or offer it to your sweetheart.     
Or keep it on your table.     
That is the way generally humans handle love.    
    
Cut it, hold it, possesses it.     
Have sex, make it a slave of your desires.     
Either be mine or perish.     
This they call love,     
it is another name of cruelty and not love.    
    
Let that flower be on the branch.     
Appreciate it there.     
Touch it and let it dry and fall it there.     
If you really love that flower     
then what is your business to pluck it?     
As if the flower is saying     
I want to give my life for your love.     
Cut me from the branch and finish me.    
    
Matter, Energy, and Consciousness     
are three truths of our existence.     
You are a consciousness.     
In that consciousness you love.     
All feelings are energy     
And you feel that     
because you have matter called body.    
    
Energy can remain subtle, constructive, or violent.     
Love is the energy of construction.     
Love is energy that empowers us to surrender and give.     
Love is energy emitting from silence     
Love is energy with which you feel liberation     
Love is energy in which you are not physical     
but a weightless balloon.     
Love is that emotion where you are emotions botched up     
You don’t know you are smiling     
or crying or numb without words.    
    
You Pratibimba, this is what I experience about     
this overly used multi-loaded word, called love.     
What is your experience of love?     
Not what you think about love!

# Article5140 : Hinduism And Celibacy

Namaste,    
    
In Christianity, what is the biggest sin of Adam and Eve?     
They ate the fruit of knowledge.     
The Forbidden fruit.     
Because of this knowledge, they became aware of their human nature     
Following that, they knew their limitation, their emotion, and feeling     
They became shy and covered their bodies.     
This led to their sex life,     
And because of sex, progeny happened.     
And we humans are the creation of that.    
    
Different people have different interpretations of this event.     
But for any normal thinking human being,     
It looks like an absurd idea.     
Why having knowledge is sin?     
Why are humans knowing their limitations is a sin?     
If sex is a sin then entire humanity is the outcome of sin.     
This way, Christianity gives very high importance to celibacy.    
    
In Islam what is the biggest reward of following the Path of Allah?     
You get eternal heaven     
But why is heaven so interesting in Islam?     
Because in heaven, each Momin gets 72 virgins!     
But what will you do of 72 virgins?     
Have sex for eternal life!     
So sex is good in Islam     
For this people do as many marriages as they can afford     
People live for it and die for sex.    
    
In Santana Dharma tradition like Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism     
Celibacy or Brahmacharya is considered one of the highest Virtue     
Patanjali yoga sutra says one of the five Yama is Brahamcharya     
Without proper Yama and Niyama in place,     
you cannot proceed on the Path of Yoga.     
Eight sequential steps of Patanjali Ashtanga Yoga are     
Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayam, Pratayahara,     
Dharana, Dhyana, and finally Samadhi.    
    
If you interpret it properly, then Patanjali is saying     
Without Celibacy, you cannot move on the path of Yoga     
Why? Because Yama means ethical life     
The absence of ethical life Will cause you restlessness     
Following that, you cannot do Asana     
Pranayam without Asana is not effective     
Dharana without Pranayam is not possible.     
Dhyana without Dharana is impossible     
Samadhi and self-realization without Dhyana are unthinkable.    
    
But, if people are interested in both     
self-realization and family life, then what to do?     
Hindu Philosophical systems say     
the purpose of marriage are many     
One, to fulfill sexual desire     
Two, to compliment two opposite energy channels of the     
two bodies so that each individual becomes balance.     
Three, have progeny so that society can survive     
and the knowledge system continues     
Four, build a healthy society with reliable relationships     
where children’s physical and mental health is taken care of     
Fifth, think beyond life, do good Karma, Yagnya together     
so that you both reach heaven together     
Sixth and final inspire each other for Moksha and Mukti.    
    
Unfortunately, most people do not understand this properly     
and they give so much importance to one or two aspects     
of their married life that they don’t realize that     
there is married life beyond sex and children.    
    
But keeping that aside,     
How a person who is interested in family life can have celibacy?     
Which is one of the key components of Yoga and self-realization?    
    
Have you seen the caves of Khajuraho?     
That is the part of Sanatana Dharama.     
Not only that, there are many temples around India     
where you see these kinds of erotic postures     
between a male and a female around the outside wall of the temple.     
What is the message?     
Sanatana Dharma is advocating do all     
whatever sensual you feel is necessary for life.     
After you are fully satisfied     
When you feel there is nothing else to be done     
then only go inside the temple with a calm mind.    
    
You cannot mediate if you are thinking about sex.     
Without meditation, Samadhi is impossible     
and hence self-realization is unattainable.    
    
People develop their own purpose of life and married life     
And to fulfill that, they do whatever is required for them.     
Sometimes they do it mutually and other times as alone.    
    
In Hindu systems, we hear many stories of     
Brahmacharya of Bhisma, Vishwamitra     
Sri Ramachandra of Ayodhya, Lakshman,     
Hanuman, Ramkrishna Paramhamsa, Vivekananda etc.     
Some were married, some not.     
Chose your ideal of life rightly,     
and try to live up to them, you may have ups and downs in your life     
but you will not feel succumbed to life.    
    
In Hinduism unlike Christianity     
Brahmacharya is not a binary concept that either you or not.     
Here it is a gradual control of life forces.     
There are people who chose lifetime Celibacy.     
There are others who chose for one year or one month.     
Ramchandra chose celibacy for fourteen years.     
Whatever degree of celibacy you can practice in your life     
that much control you can exercise on your physical and mental body.    
    
The highest degree of Brahmacharya can lead to the highest virtuous life     
It can protect one from physical aging and physical diseases,     
It can protect one from disgrace and confusion.     
It gives you intellectual, mental, and physical strength to live like a Jeevan Mukta.    
    
It protects one from mental sickness, craziness,     
It helps in culminating Bhakti and meditative mind.     
It helps in developing strong resolute.     
It frees one from the dual mind     
It gives clarity in thinking.    
    
In Sanatana Dharma Sex is neither virtue nor sin.     
Celibacy doesn’t mean lifelong celibacy     
Everything has some purpose in life.     
Try to understand the purpose and move.     
Don’t become crazy about anything     
As you see in everyday newspapers or health magazines.    
    
Oh Pratibimba, Am I making sense to you?     
What do you think about Brahmacharya ?

# Article5141 : Limitations Of Logic    
tags: [ 'My Views', Philosophy, Science]    
    
Namaste,    
    
Logic is a lately developed human phenomenon.     
But in reality, there is no logic anywhere in the existence.     
Humans give meaning to life.     
Humans give names to happening.     
Humans try to understand happening through a logic system.    
    
Human is mad for logic.     
Events in the surroundings and nature are happening     
because of unknown reasons.     
Humans get frustrated by this unknown     
so they seek logic for everything.     
Some people, out of these logics, come up with physics or chemistry.     
Some who fail to understand the phenomenon handover the happening     
to God and say God created, God knows, God is great.     
Humans have created many useful things     
from logic and science.     
That is why we are so much     
advanced culture in the 21st century.    
    
But neither science understand the     
existential phenomenon fully through logic     
nor believer’s god knows.     
Life doesn’t work that way.     
You seek logic in creation,     
but creation is beyond logic, alogical not illogical.     
But, people seek logic for everything.    
    
Ask yourself, what is the logic?     
Why do people fall in love?     
Why do people die?     
Why do people succeed or fail?     
Why does someone eat rice first from the plate and not roti?     
Why do people fail in exams or in business?     
Why crooked people look like enjoying life     
and so-called good people suffering?     
Why someone abused abuses someone else?     
Why did someone slap someone else? etc.    
    
You try to know the logic.     
You may get an answer.     
But Validate that answer.     
You will know, people do all kinds of things     
with the same condition and logic.     
So logic doesn’t define everything.    
    
Logic helps to govern society, having laws,     
making life comfortable, but still not enough to understand life.    
    
Ask yourself why there are Jails and     
Mental asylum in this world?     
How many are living there?     
Those who inside feel     
outside people are bereft of logic     
I did something because of ABC logic     
and they put me here.    
    
Cannibals are normal people.     
They also have hunger and thrust.     
When they are hungry they feel lazy     
to go farming or animal killing.     
It is easy to kill who is sleeping next     
to eat and drink his/her blood.     
And we know cannibals also do their business with some logic.    
    
Cannibals have their own set of logic,     
which is incompatible with others.     
Like our Afghanistan or TTK Taliban gentlemen.     
Ask them why are they creating havoc on the planet     
or for their own fellow citizens?     
And you will get logical answers from them.     
It is different, it does not fit into your logic system.     
     
Is there any absolute logic system like law of physics? No.     
Is it necessary that everything happening around has logic? No.     
Is it necessary to seek the logic of whatever is happening around?     
Yes, it helps us in generalization. It helps in creating rules.     
It helps in managing society better.     
But can everything be explained through logic? No.     
     
Oh Pratibimba, did you follow     
how the events happen around us independently     
but humans associate every event to logic?     
Some event happens first and     
then human follow it with logic.     
People proud of their logic say     
every happening must be followed by a logic!

# Article5142 : Dussehra 2021    
tags: [ 'Annual Wishes', 'Indian Culture', 'My Views', Philosophy, Prayers]    
    
## Dussehra – Vijay Dashami    
    
Namaste,    
    
Any Festival is an occasion to celebrate.     
If the day is Vijaya Dashami     
Then the day is to     
Celebrate your success (Vijay)     
Celebrate your journey     
Celebrate your learning through a tough time     
Otherwise, many people quit on the way.    
    
Celebrate the success of your parents, Acharyas     
Celebrate the success of your King and state     
Celebrate the success of your Ideology, party, and people.    
    
In India, people celebrate Vijay Dashami     
Because this was the day when Ram killed Ravana,     
The epitome of the Adharma of Rama’s time.    
    
Some people celebrate this event as a symbol     
Because they feel past win just reminds us     
that we can still win over current adverse circumstances.     
Some people celebrate as an annual affair     
of some historic event which happened only once     
and that win was the ultimate.    
    
Whatever you think depends upon what you value.     
But, before you go to win something,     
Please make sure that you know yourself clearly.     
Winning is not that important     
Who is going to win whom is also important.     
In an eternal fight between Daivik and Asuri shakti     
sometimes Devta wins and sometimes Asura wins.    
    
Your Asura may be someone’s Devta     
Your Devata may be someone’s Asura     
You may be Asura for someone and Devata for someone.     
Many times we remain busy defining others and explaining ourselves.    
    
Vijay Dashami is not only time to celebrate success     
But also reflects who we are     
What we really want to win over     
Is it worth winning that     
Maybe we are standing at the wrong side     
like Vibhishan, then losing is more beneficial.    
    
May be we are standing for a wrong cause     
like Duryodhana so accepting and surrendering     
before the war is also winning.     
Winning always doesn’t need     
the destruction of Kurushetra scale.     
Sometimes it is just switching to Dharma.     
But don’t be like politicians to switch     
when you know Dharma is at your side     
but in the current circumstances, you may lose.    
    
Standing for Dharma is not easy     
Neither it is easy to stand for Adharma     
Generally, people get scared of circumstances and change the party.     
But the beauty with Dharma is some universal force     
will keep supporting you     
and even if you are alone you will not feel so.    
    
We recently have seen Taliban also won and they celebrated     
Probably they will celebrate for some more years.     
But, at what price?     
What are they celebrating, win of Adharma?     
Are they celebrating unjust to poor, weak, common citizens,     
women, children, the crippling education system,     
and friendship with the real enemy?    
    
Rama’s win is celebrated even after thousands of years,     
because it was not a personal fight only.     
It was for Dharma, justice, pride of women.     
It was a struggle to keep the words given at personal loss     
It was not personal ego but     
Demolishing hyped ego which was on the path of continuous destruction.    
    
You think Rama is your own self     
Sita is your own self.     
Ram Rajya is your inner state and immediate surrounding.     
Winning does not mean eating too much, shopping, party, and alcohol.     
Winning simply means being     
At absolute ease with your own people,     
your surroundings, enjoying without indulgence.     
Otherwise, it may be possible Ravana is celebrating Rama’s win.    
    
O Praribimba, may you get the wisdom     
to know the right path and wrong path     
of your life journey with clarity.     
May you decide your parties, partner, and friends with that clarity.     
Some will join you and you will join some.     
You will drop someone and someone will drop you.     
May you fight a decisive fight of Dharma     
May you win your fight, so that you can celebrate your own     
Vijaya Dashami today and in the time to come.

# Article5143 : About Food And Nourishment    
tags: [ Life, 'My Views', 'Pleasure &amp; Joy', Yoga]    
    
Namaste,    
    
We have three living bodies embedded together     
But superficially it looks one.     
When it comes to nourishing, it is our responsibility to nourish all three.     
Consuming food that nourishes the     
Only one body and ignoring others is not wise.     
If you do it willingly, then it is a type of slow suicide.    
    
Since childhood, if you are focused on     
The food of only one body then     
You cannot experience     
your own existence in the other two bodies.     
Because it is almost dead or ignored so much     
that no voice of nourishment need     
reaches your current level of living.    
    
The food of all three bodies is different.     
Different foods are rich in different content and different nutrition,     
so they nourish different bodies     
with different degrees and different ways.    
    
Those bodies are gross or physical or matter-body.     
Emotional, intellectual, energy body.     
And your causal body, which is supporting your two bodies,     
cause of your beyond body existence,     
beyond time and space body,     
in quality, it is one with the universe.     
Sanskrit text refers to it as JivaAtman.     
In fact, it is not a body in a physical sense     
Because it is beyond matter and energy.    
    
Food can be grain, vegetables, milk, meat,     
egg, fish, flesh from other life, or fruits.     
It depends upon your culture and geography of living.    
    
Food can be ideas which you get from others     
while interacting or observing others.    
    
Food can be internally generated emotions     
when you feel for somebody or some cause or some event.     
These emotions feed our energy body.    
    
Food can be sweet, bitter, salt, sour, pungent in taste.     
And even these six tastes can be in     
the different degrees in the different food.     
The sweetness of apple and sweetness of sugar     
are different in quality and grade.     
The sweetness of the emotions of hugging your child     
and hugging your best friend is different in quality and grade.     
The sweetness of feeling one with your God     
and one with your life partner is different in quality and grade.    
    
Some foods are more juicy     
And some are more solid     
Some are good for your muscles     
Some are good for emotional development     
Some are good for spiritual development.    
    
When I see the madness of people around the food     
I have nothing other than to smile     
at the so much focused thinking in one direction     
that in other dimensions they become bankrupt.    
    
Two see this, ask yourself,     
why some people are very solid in their physical health     
But they are bitter in their emotions?    
    
Why are some people, who are highly emotional     
for their loved one or God or guru,     
but intellectually bank corrupt.     
Lost the ability to think independently?     
They cannot hear even     
a single unpleasant word about their loved one.     
Not only that they can disturb themselves     
or the speaker, even if a speaker is saying the truth.    
    
Why, spiritually advance looking people,     
suffer loneliness and need a crowd around them     
to serve them to make them happy.     
Where is the feeling and experience of oneness?     
Is that only for books or just one-time phenomenon of life?    
    
Why people who are intellectually sharp     
cannot stand and run for one mile on a road?     
And other times they fail to connect     
the miseries and joy of others?    
    
Why do people eat animals but love their pets     
so as if they are biological children?    
    
Why do people love their own biological children     
but don’t feel the same for other children?     
If all this is not intellectual and emotional disability     
then what is this called?     
If this all is not because of improper nourishment     
then what is the cause of all this?    
    
Some much has been written,     
will be written on the food that it is an industry itself.     
Even well know experts who are recommending     
all sorts of healthy food to others     
but doing slow suicide of their own in their other bodies.    
    
Don’t we see that super successful people feel alone?     
Super rich people living on pills?     
Super intelligent people are dry and emotionally dead?     
Super wealthy people behave like beggars?     
And a muscular person is lacking the ability     
to comprehend philosophical ideas?    
    
You think eating two times or three times is a must     
otherwise, your overall development will not happen!     
People work hard, make money for eating and     
see around how many people are really happy!     
I mean really happy without any     
support of other people, object, entertainment.     
They cannot. What we see is not called happiness     
but the addiction to food.     
They need something and someone     
all the time otherwise they will crash.     
The presence of other people around them     
is food for them to live happily.    
    
You take this modern medical diet system     
of fat, protein, vitamins, carbohydrates,     
and their sources so seriously     
that you don’t even ask questions about     
how Yogis or Forest dwellers or beggars are much happier     
than you, who work so much just to eat healthy food?    
    
Human is the only animal on this planet     
who doesn’t know what to eat, when to eat     
and how much to eat even     
after living 20, 30, 50, or 80 years on this planet.     
We have religion on the food.     
We have universities on the food.     
We have industries on the food.     
We have experts, doctors, nutrition, religious gurus talking about food.    
    
But animals without all this grand system     
Who lives a much shorter life than humans     
never get confused about what to eat and what not?    
    
It is we who make animals our pets     
and dictate their diet and food     
as we dictate for our children.     
We are confused, we confuse our children     
and we confuse animals, birds     
and reptiles whoever we take as our pet.    
    
Food is for nourishment.     
Nourishment is not only about eating.     
Many times, not eating is also nourishment.     
Go only juice diet for few days, experience that.     
Go only water for few days, experience that.     
Go without food for one day and experience that.     
Go only with a particular taste     
for a couple of weeks and experience that.     
Leave one taste for a few weeks and experience that.     
Drop one-time food for a few weeks and experience that.    
    
Go on silence for a day and two and experience that.     
This is one kind of food.     
Sit at someplace for sometime     
without doing anything physically and mentally     
this is another kind of food needed for your body.    
    
Live alone in a forest or secluded place     
without any friend and family     
This is another food needed to know your own existence.    
    
O Pratibimba, Spiritual means spirit, it means not matter.     
To know and experience yourself as a spirit or Atman     
one needs to design many experiments.     
Spirituality is not only mental and intellectual gymnasium.     
It is also about knowing the self as     
beyond physical, mental, and intellectual food.    
    
It is about experientially knowing yourself     
as unborn external Atman.

tags: [ 'Annual Wishes']    
    
## Prayers and Wishes on the Occasion of Deepawali    
    
Namaste,    
    
Earth has completed one more rotation around the Sun     
Time has turned again and once more     
Diwali of this year has come at my door     
I am ready to go out     
To Light the lamp on the outside of walls of my house.     
To search those whom I lost in 365 days.     
To invite those who went away from me     
To share the sweets prepared by sweet keeper     
To share the gift and to give the warmth.    
    
The festival of light has come again     
At the dawn of my life     
Rama and Sita has gone out from home     
They are wandering and     
it looks they have lost the path to home     
Who can show them the light to return back to home?     
     
There is a lot of light in the street and On the balcony     
but Rama and Sita are still not able     
to find the way back to home.     
Maybe our light is not enough     
In which they can see     
Maybe Ram and Sita has become blind     
in too much light of consumerism and glamour.     
Maybe they are not interested in coming home.     
Maybe they have adjusted themselves     
in the forest of confusion     
and on the roads of madness.    
    
Ram and Sita of our personality     
Has lost the way     
They look tired     
Perhaps they want to return the home     
But in our ignorance     
We have locked the door from outside     
And want to enter inside by knocking on the door.     
     
There is no one inside     
No one will open the door from inside     
If you want to celebrate Diwali at your home     
Then open the door of your home     
Which you closed long back.     
     
You closed the door when you went to     
See and enjoy the world     
To do the shopping     
To make money and earn name and fame     
If you have earned enough     
then let Sita and Ram enter the house     
This time let them celebrate Diwali at their home.    
    
Sita and Ram are the symbols of love in the relationship     
Sita is an example of a wife and friend in a tough time of life.     
Ram is an example of Maryada, Dharma, bravery.     
Maybe if you search you will find     
more attributes of your Sita and Rama.     
More than what new dimensions you find     
It is important that Ram and Sita return in your heart.    
    
In the last year of Covid, so many lost their lives.     
Many of the lost were our closed ones.     
Bodies don’t turn back.     
Memories never leave     
till our mind is working normal, and we are living.     
May the memories of those,     
who are far from you, lighten your heart.     
Bring a big smile on your face.     
May you share that smile with others.     
May you share that smile with your mirror.    
    
May this year Diwali we turn inside     
to search our lost Ram and Sita.     
May this year Diwali Ram and Sita in you     
resolve to dissolve all the bitterness of the relationship.     
May they be better guided by love,     
compassion, commitment, and chastity.    
    
May a relationship have some deeper meaning for you.     
May this Diwali be beyond the transaction of giving and taking gifts.     
May it be much more than a business season.     
May it be a season of the inside journey.     
May it be a season of Ram and Sita’s homecoming.     
May it be a season of self-realization for you.    
    
O Chaitanya, may you become more poise, peaceful mind     
May you have an intellect full of wisdom     
May you have a healthy body     
May you earn and get all the success you want     
May you return home, at least for one day.     
Home, your real home in the waking state of your mind.     
May you live in that home with full awakening     
and without the substance of alcohol, drug, smoke, or any addiction.     
Without any fear, sadness, worry.     
May you live like fearless Dharma.

tags: [ Concepts, Life, Mind, 'My Views', Maya]    
    
Namaste,    
    
There is the world that exists outside,     
That is the objective world.     
There is the world that exists inside our body boundary,     
this is the subjective world.    
    
An apple or flower or politician exists outside     
in the objective world as per their own attributes.     
In our day-to-day life, this objective world     
has no influence from what you think and feel     
about it in your own individual subjective world.    
    
There are two kinds of worlds within our body boundary.     
The first is an experiential or existential world.     
The second is a mental or fictional world.     
You can also refer to it as the Maya world.     
It exists, but not the way reality exists in the world.    
    
The first, existential world is that     
which you experience     
with your in breath and out breath.     
The world in which you experience     
pain and comfort in your body.    
    
This world is momentary     
Created and destroyed every moment.     
This experiential world is not created in the time of past or future.     
Therefore, it does not exist in the past or future.     
The experiential world is coming out from     
the present moment and exists only at that moment.    
    
The second, “mental world” is that     
which we create with our     
mental, emotional, intellectual ability.     
This world is our own creation     
The beauty and ugliness of this     
depends upon the sharpness of our senses,     
Our ability to focus, ability to think     
Ability to imagine, ability to reason,     
Ability to associate emotionally     
with objects and people around.    
    
This world is more permanent and remains     
with us as long as our brain is working properly,     
as long as we are living.     
This is the world of the past of the future.     
It depends 100% on us     
how we create this fictional     
but more permanent looking world.    
    
This is fictional because it exists in our minds.     
Is this fictional world true at this moment? No.     
Can it become true in the next moment?     
Maybe yes or Maybe not.     
Most of the time we have     
fantasies and fear in this world,     
and unfortunately, we don’t know,     
neither have any way to know till the event actually happens.     
So we keep it, nurture it and value it.     
We think it is real and it has value.    
    
There is nothing called     
Permanent evil or pious thought     
Permanent good or bad thought     
Permanent bad or good karma     
Action may be physical, mental, or verbal.     
The quality of output of an action is the parameter     
to make the decision of good or bad.     
If we like the output of certain action     
then we label that as good action for that moment.     
if we don’t like the output of the action     
then action is labeled as bad.     
The action itself is not good or bad.     
Like or dislike of the output     
of action by the receiver labels actions.    
    
You can do action only in the present     
Nobody can work in the future or in the past     
The action happens at the moment     
or at the cursor where time is blinking for you.    
    
You can suffer or enjoy at the present     
or at the cursor where time is blinking for you.     
You cannot suffer in the past or future.     
You can suffer in present because of past and future.     
You have immense ability to suffer at present     
because of the memories of the past     
and fear of the future.    
    
Our ability to think, memorize and imagine     
has the power to paralyze our life if not used properly.     
But this is possible only when     
we live too much in the fictional or mental world.    
    
If you take a decision to live     
in a real, existential, experiential, present world     
Then there is no suffering, there is no joy.     
It is just living with awareness.     
Awareness that you are life     
and everything around is life.     
Awareness that actions are happening on the surface     
of an infinite size plate called space.     
Fall and rise of objects, people, relationships, and     
even of planets, stars, and galaxies are happening on this plate.    
    
If you live in your own created,     
past, or future mental and permanent world     
Then there is joy and suffering both.     
There is no choice there. Both are yours.     
Cyclically or accidentally or by fate     
you will keep experiencing swings of life.     
Good good, bad bad whatever you love or hate     
is part of your own mental world.    
    
In one second there are 1000 milliseconds     
In those 1000 milliseconds, you can breathe once.     
In those 1000 milliseconds of one breath,     
you can create a mental world and live there     
in the fear of the future, guilt, and losses of the past.     
Or you can live in that breath without future and past.    
    
O Chaitanya, everyone takes one breath at a time.     
And life is made of these breaths.     
Therefore, if you live with those breaths of yours,     
then there are no worries of the future and no guilt of the past.     
That is why it is said if you learn to live in the present     
then there is no worry exists for you.

# Article5146 : A Price For The Wrong Identification    
tags: [ 'My Views', Philosophy, Vedanta]    
    
Namaste,    
    
If someone asks us, who are you?     
Or we ask ourselves, who am I?     
Or we ask someone, who are you?     
What answer do we expect from others?     
Or what answer do we give them?    
    
Depending upon the context and situation     
the answer can vary but if you analyze the answer     
then you will find the answer is referring     
to objects and concepts around the answerer.    
    
For example, people can say     
I am Indian, I am German.     
I work for Toshiba, I work for Infosys.     
I am 40 years old, I live in Bangalore.     
I am married, I have two children     
I have a penthouse, I have a BMW car     
I am male, I love playing football.     
I am peace loving person,     
I donate for the poor children’s education     
I am an atheist but believe in universal power.     
And it keeps going on.    
    
If you analyze these sentences     
then you will find sentences     
containing ‘am’ ‘do’ ‘did’ ‘have’ ‘believe’.    
    
How it is different from     
I have two hands, two lungs,     
I believe I have a soul     
I love reading books etc.    
    
Some objects are obvious and visible     
so it looks odd to tell about those objects.     
So people tell about that     
which is not obvious or not visible to others.    
    
Either you refer to obvious objects     
or non-obvious things as yourself,     
You are referring to your surroundings as you.     
You are referring to your actions and beliefs as you.    
    
But in truth, if someone is doing an act of     
believing, loving, or having then that is one’s identity.     
Is that the ultimate identity of that person?    
    
When people get fed up with business, relationships,     
or objects like a car, computer, etc     
they leave them and move     
to another place and another relationship.     
It may be painful but easier to leave physical things.    
    
Because of your time, money, and emotional investment     
in those things, mentally you still hold those.     
Can you leave those mentally?    
    
Whatever hard method you try to leave mentally     
that makes things more sticky and dirty.     
It is like grease.    
    
People try different entertainment     
or mind engagement activities and believe it will go     
But when you see a similar face     
or listen to similar sounds, or smells, etc     
it resurfaces and the same problem starts.     
Why? because as long as you have a healthy brain,     
the mind doesn’t drop things.     
     
It is not that simple to drop things mentally     
as you can drop your computer     
and replace it with a new computer.    
    
But why this problem happens to almost every human being     
and we don’t use the correct remedy for this?    
    
All Human pay the price of referring to objects,     
and the environment around them as themselves.     
And when a problem happens you drop the physical objects     
and environment but your whole life     
the practice of referring to objects as self     
is still held in your memory system.    
    
People take the help of psychologists, music,     
live with different people and in different environments     
it helps a little bit and this is not the solution.    
    
You live in some house and     
your close person dies in that house     
some people change their house for better living.     
But other people resolve not to leave the house till their last breath     
because they enjoy the memories of their loved ones in the house.     
Either you leave or live in the house     
both are happening because of object referral     
or referring to objects and environment as the self.    
    
From books or sermons or spiritual discourses,     
we have heard we are Atma or soul or Rooh or Chetan Tattva etc.     
But this whole is the bookish idea     
It is like you are living in a desert and you learned     
how to swim by reading a book.     
You ask any person whether he believes in god or not     
Irrespective of their answer,     
almost all believe they have Atma or soul or spirit.    
    
The tragedy is that they believe.     
They don’t experience themselves as Atman.     
The tragedy is they say ‘I have Soul’ not ‘I am Soul’     
“I have a car” and “I am a car” both are not the same ideas.     
“I have Atma” and “I am Atma” both are not the same ideas.     
But people say I have Atma like I have a car.    
    
O Chaitanya, “you are not a body” but “you have a body”.     
“You are Atman” and “you don’t have atman”.     
Referring to nonself as self and     
self as nonself throughout your whole life     
is the price that humanity pays for suffering,     
Dukha and unrest in the mind.    
    
No God, Guru, or Doctor can cure this disease.     
The disease causes us bondage.     
No Jeeva likes bondage even cattle want to be free.     
But because of the wrong Identification,     
we become like cattle, slaves of body needs,     
environment, and people around us.

# Article5147 : The Art Of Dying 2    
tags: [ Death, Life, 'My Views', Yoga]    
    
Namaste,    
    
Inhaling is different from exhaling and     
Exhaling is different from inhaling     
Both never happens to us at the same time     
But both happen continuously, one after another.    
    
If you breathe fully, in awareness, and with satisfaction then     
There is no pain in exhaling.     
It happens automatically, and it is as satisfying as inhaling.     
Without inhaling, there is hope for exhaling     
Without exhaling, there is no hope for inhaling.    
    
Inhaling is life, exhaling is death.     
We know after inhaling is exhaling is a must     
In fact, when we breathe in with peace,     
we can breathe out with peace.     
But when we don’t know we are breathing     
Then inhaling or exhaling doesn’t matter.     
In fact, we foolishly think inhaling is the only way to live.     
And don’t appreciate the power of exhaling.    
    
Living is between life and death.     
Living is in between breath-in and breath-out.     
Living is a coin with two sides, called inhale and exhale.     
Living is a coin with two sides, we can call them life and death.    
    
When we don’t know how to live     
Then we are afraid of dying     
When we live every moment in consciousness,     
then where is the fear of dying?     
Millions of exhaling we do in life, so millions of times we die.     
There is one exhale in life     
After which we don’t inhale, that is the final dying.    
    
If you get an opportunity to live in a village or forest     
You will notice there are thousands of reptiles,     
Insects, birds, and other animals.     
They also live and die but when they die     
they are not cremated or buried like humans.    
    
But we don’t find their bodies lying     
here or there in the village or forest.     
Except when some animal has eaten another animal,     
you will notice some bone lying around.     
So where do they go?     
Where do they drop their body?     
Does it happen that during some work animal has     
all of a sudden, heart attack happens, and it dies?     
Or it has overeaten and died because of excessive food?     
Or because of inappropriate lifestyle,     
they develop diabetes, and they die because of insulin or obesity?    
    
When they live, they live fully.     
When the time of death come     
perhaps they know it much in advance.     
So they prepare for it and withdraw from     
day to activities and isolate from remaining     
birds, reptiles, and animals and     
drop the body in some awareness.    
    
Human is a social and economic animal     
It has learned several things from different animals     
For most of us, enjoyment means     
when we have eat enough, wandered enough, slept enough,     
had sex, fed others, or overpowered others.     
But these same activities give satisfaction to animals.     
The only thing is we do these things in different ways.    
    
Thus, we learned to live from animals.     
Or we are a kind of animal, so we know how to live.     
But we are the only animals who don’t know how to die.     
Most people think learning how to die means how to suicide!     
Have you seen animals are doing suicide?     
But they still die!    
    
By constant putting food,     
different kinds of food and medicine inside the body, we keep it up.     
In fact, we are so much engrossed in nurturing the body     
that when it starts saying time is over     
we don’t listen and keep living with other people     
and keep taking medicines or food or remain in hospital.     
When life is really over,     
Then what food or medicine can bring more life?    
    
But this all happens because     
we have not learned to live a life.     
The day human learns how to live     
They will not feel hopeless     
when they have to think about dying     
They will not feel too much about insurance,     
taxes and hospital expenses.     
He will not feel crazy about loosing     
all the relations and wealth accumulated here.    
    
O Pratibimba, if humans have learned living without     
knowing the art of living, then s/he missed the art of dying     
and if s/he missed this lesson during her/his lifetime, then     
that will cause huge suffering to him/her.

# Article5148 : AI And Free Soul    
tags: [ Science, Vedanta]    
    
Namaste,    
    
Human likes certainty but enjoys good surprises     
and learns from bad surprises.     
To make the future certain and predictable,     
he wants to plan future actions, have future strategies.     
That is why he loves prediction.     
     
But prediction is possible when statistics and     
past data roam together in the analytical human mind.     
Individual Human has limited capability and capacity     
to access and process past data.     
Hence, we needed a machine.     
Independent of humans, these machines     
can use statistics and data together.     
But the analytical human mind gives them algorithms.     
This is how AI takes birth to tell you the future.    
    
Now, machines can tell you how much inventory     
you need to hold to make an optimal profit,     
When you need to advertise to have maximum sales.     
How much to produce to maximize profit.     
What is there in the given image.     
Which next music you can enjoy.     
What is the meaning of textual feedback on your website.     
What is the sentiment of long paragraph feedback.     
What is the answer to your question.     
What are the possible question and their answer     
by reading a product manual.    
    
We can create AI apps that help you predict the future,     
getting gems from the mine of endless data.     
You need AI to answer your personal, social,     
business, political, and scientific questions.     
Now AI started entering into all the aspects of life     
like software started entering into every business in 90s     
and the phone started entering into     
every home in the first and second decade of the 21st century.    
    
Earlier time someone who can tell future we call him god.     
Then we called him future teller or Jyotish.     
Now we call that AI.    
    
But who knows the future of an unconditioned and free soul?     
No god, Jyotish, or AI can tell anything about a free soul.     
The free soul has a free will unaffected from the past karma.     
Unaffected from Affection (Raga) or Aversion (Dvesa) or Desire (Iccha).     
So past data does not drive their decision.     
What will they do? No one knows.     
Whether they will do anything or not? No one knows.     
So all gods, Jyotish and AI are helpless before a liberated soul.    
    
The concept of an unconditioned soul is good.     
But is there any completely free soul?     
How does he live when he is in the body?    
    
In today’s time when AI can predict     
What you will eat, when you will sleep,     
what health problem you can have,     
when you will buy and what you will buy,     
when you will date and with whom,     
whether you will have a successful marriage with X person or not.     
Whether you will lose money or make money in the stock market.     
Who can be your friend and who cannot.     
How much ice will melt and how many cities can emerge in water.     
Who will win an election and who will lose.     
In this situation, human has not become a slave to AI.     
But the human was a slave of his own desires.     
Which bounds him to action.     
Action bounds him to results.     
Result bounds him to like and dislike.     
Like, dislike bound him to reaction.     
And all this data makes prediction possible.     
Statistics, AI, and Machine Learning is     
just looking at your patterns and telling you about you,     
which you completely have forgotten.    
    
But they do not remind you of your real nature     
Like ancient Gurus reminded you, “Tat Tvam Asi”     
Jyotish, AI, and Future Tells are reminding you     
that you are salve of circumstances,     
situations, environment, and your own desire.    
    
You want to choose freedom or slavery is your choice.     
You choose Jyotish/AI to tell you the future is your choice.     
You choose Guru who tells you are an absolute unbound soul.     
That is your choice.     
You work for your own liberation is your choice.     
O Chaitanya, what you desire only you know.

# Article5150 : Challenges In The Meditation Process    
tags: [ Meditation, Mind, Mindfulness]    
    
Namaste,    
    
You can meditate with open eyes     
and you can meditate with closed eyes.    
    
When you want to meditate with open eyes     
then the objective is to handle the worldly affair properly.     
Doing work with Dhyana.     
Knowing the world properly and working properly.    
    
When you want to mediate with close eyes     
then the objective is to know.     
Know your own system, your existence,     
your mind, your nature, your desires, restlessness,     
flickering and fluctuations of the mind,     
ego, jealousy, like, dislike of your mind.     
Raga and Dvesa of your mind.    
    
The design of our sense organs is such that     
it is outward-going and     
it helps navigate the external world very efficiently.    
    
As strong your sense organs     
with that much force, you will be navigating     
the color, sound, smell, sensation, and taste     
around you or in your memory.    
    
Due to some reason     
if by birth some sense is weak     
then the neural system reorganizes itself     
and the neural resources of that organ     
are shared between other normal senses.    
    
Our sense organs ensure our survival.     
In case, if a particular sense organ is weak     
then an external attack from the environment     
can kill or damage the body.     
For example, if someone has lost his taste sense     
then he may die at any time     
because of eating poison or improper food     
which his tongue could have detected easily,     
if it were working properly.    
    
When you sit at someplace that is lightened,     
having music around, some fragrance or bad smell around     
and you want to take your awareness     
inside the body then it becomes a difficult task.    
    
Why? Because eyes go and look at the objects,     
color, shape, and intensity of light falling on the objects     
and making us aware of our surroundings.     
Mind and stored memories may like some of these things around     
or may not like other things around.    
    
Similarly, when you are sitting in a room,     
and some music is going on or sound is present,     
because of memories mind may like     
some music or sounds and may not like it.    
    
Similarly, it happens for smell and fragrance.     
Your mind may like some smells and may not like others.    
    
When the temperature in the room is making     
you uneasy or the seat on which you are sitting is too soft     
or too hard then your mind may like or may not like it.    
    
You may not be hungry but if some food is before you,     
then your mind may have the temptation to eat that     
or may feel disgusted depending upon what food is kept before you.    
    
This like and dislike of the mind due to different reasons     
has roots in the outward nature of the senses.     
It will never allow you to meditate inside.     
The body wants to take action to make the environment     
more friendly for living or survival.    
    
Your sense of imagination, visualizing different colors,     
shapes, forms, smells, etc help you in Bhakti and external meditation.     
This object may be your worldly object,     
your sweet relationships with someone, or Ishwara or Ishta Devta.    
    
But when you want to know your nature     
and meditate inside then these sense organs are a big problem     
because they are designed to navigate the outside world.    
    
So in my experience when a room is completely empty and dark,     
no noise, no fragrance, no extreme temperature     
so that you can sit with a single lightest cloth,     
and without hurting your body,     
you are not feeling hungry     
nor you have eaten food immediately before,     
your stomach is empty or you have eaten 2 or 3 hours before.     
This is the proper setup to navigate inside.    
    
In this situation mentally travel between     
the environment around you and within your body     
with your rhythm inhaling and exhaling.    
    
If you are able to do this even for 5 minutes     
and improve this slowly you will be able to know yourself.     
And probably one day you will be able     
to learn to live in the present     
and renounce your fear of the future and guilt of the past.     
At least for the duration of meditation.     
     
If you keep doing it regularly     
one day will come when even the most adverse situations     
can not throw you out of balance,     
but because of certain circumstances, if it happens     
then you will be able to come to the center quickly.    
    
O Chaitanya, did you ever try to meditate     
when the situations in your life are adverse?     
Did you try to be meditative to know your own mind?     
Did you try to know who you really are     
apart from the heap of food     
which you have accumulated within you in the form     
of mental ideas (like I am Atma, I am soul, I am jiva, heaven, hell, god)?     
This mental food comes from your books and teachers.     
The food can be physical food,     
which you accumulated and makes your body mass,     
which you get by eating tasty food.

# Article5151 : Earnings Of Life    
tags: [ 'Mad Thinking', 'My Views', Philosophy]    
    
Namaste,    
    
You are living comfortably at your home.     
You have inquisitiveness to know the world around     
So you go out and travel as far places as you want to know.    
    
While on the journey you feel you have to eat to survive     
But you need money to eat and pay for     
your temporary stay at different hotels.     
For that, you need to earn money.     
You learn some useful arts and skills.    
    
The currency of the market is the onion.     
So after acquiring skills,     
you earn lots of onions to make your journey happy.     
You are not happy due to the smell of the onion     
because at home you didn’t like onion,     
you have different kinds of fragrances there.     
So you are accustomed to the great smells.    
    
Now you are in hell due to the onion’s smell     
Onion currency is the need of journey     
so you have to earn it and keep it.    
    
You want to travel more and see more.     
For that, you earn lots of onion and keep it in an onion bank     
so that you can withdraw at any time at any place.    
    
One day you thought enough.     
I want to go back home.     
But your onion is the problem.     
You want to show your earnings     
and experiences of your journey to your family members.    
    
Now, you withdraw all onion from your bank.     
Put that in cargo and start traveling towards home.     
It took you 2 months reaching back to your home.     
In between due rain and humidity     
Some of the onions start smelling more than others.    
    
Anyhow, you reach home.     
Your family members welcome you.     
You unload lots of onions from your cargo and fill your house.     
Other family members ask you not to do so     
but you say it is my earnings     
I earned it through hard work.    
    
After some time, you also started feeling uncomfortable     
with this onion smell.     
You are at your home now, but again you are in hell.    
    
Humans need to ask himself     
Due to his desire, what is he creating?     
Humans need to ask himself     
After his hard work, what is he earning?    
    
O Chaitanya, everyone has to go back home.     
During travel feeling hell that is still ok     
But after reaching home you shouldn’t feel hell.     
So don’t indulge in any so-called good or bad of the need of the hours     
That can give you a hellish experience     
during your traveling back home or when you are back in your home.

# Article5152 : Learning Process    
tags: [ Education, 'My Views']    
    
Namaste,    
    
When you see some long physics or maths formula then don’t get scared of it. It is just a way to represent the reality. Is it an absolute reality? No, it just represents that reality, and the absolute reality is very close to this. Whether it is a formula of gravity or force or angular momentum or energy calculations or anything else.    
    
But how do these formulas come into existence? Inquisitiveness, a deep thinking mind, and a habit of learning are instrumental to this.    
    
What is learning? Generalization of observation is learning. If you are memorizing then very soon you will reach to confused state with lots of data in your mind. In learning, process memory is used to look back but till the time you don’t identify patterns in learning it is not learning.    
    
Once you are able to generalize then you can state that in the form of physics formulas or laws or moral rules or social rules of an unknown society.    
    
Will that formula or rule work for you in all situations? Well, it depends on how many people/samples are observed, how long it was observed, the quality of a dedicated focused mind observing, etc.    
    
For example, some people have a knowledge (generalization) that if you are walking alone and the lion sees you it will kill you. Reason? People can develop many reasons once they are convinced of their conclusion. But that is not the right way of reaching to a conclusion. By seeing movies, and listening to stories we generalize and then make a certain opinion about events, objects, people, environment, etc around them.    
    
A black cat crosses your way when you are going for auspicious work. It is not good. It is a conclusion. It is a simple formula without mathematical representation. But you can put that in mathematical terms as well. Because this is a social stigma so physicists don’t bother to put that in a math formula.    
    
If an object slip from a 10-meter height terrace it will go down. What speed it will travel? How hard it will hit the ground? How much force is required to stop it at 5-meter height etc are all human questions. For many centuries people were puzzled over this observation that why everything falls down and then somebody could give us a physics formula to calculate and know the answer to all the questions, we had. Using these formulas we could develop technology and fly in space.    
    
Suppose you have a formula or law or rule written on your paper, this applies to a rock piece but does not apply to other objects then will you really call that a rule? Yes, we will, but only for rocks and not for anything else.    
    
But if you observe deeply you will know that the particular law doesn’t apply to subatomic particles! Is that rule reliable? Is that rule useful? Yes, and it has its own usefulness and limitations!    
    
Generalization of certain concepts is learning. The more is a generalization, the more is learning.    
    
That is why the best scientists ask the question what is that one law, principle, or formula by which everything can be explained? They are struggling hard with a different name and trying to unify all the know laws of matter, force, and energy but still, nothing is explaining that one.    
    
Can they do it? I don’t know.     
Is there one thing from which everything has come? I think everything has come into existence from ‘no’ thing so the search is good to know more about our existence and the reality of the cosmos but looking for a ‘thing’ is not a good idea. But as scientists, we look only for things so we should keep our work on. Because this is about the objective reality around.

# Article5153 : What Is Success?    
tags: [ Devotion, 'My Views']    
    
Namaste,    
    
A mosquito or flee is roaming around and disturbing you     
You plan to kill it, and you killed it, it is a success.     
An employee is looking for rupees 10000     
for his child’s hospital expenses and     
HR could arrange that finally, it is a success for him.     
A child wants to pass her 5th class exam     
and if she passes it, it is a success.     
If you want to through a used napkin in a dustbin     
and it goes there inside, it is a success.    
    
So success means you want to do something     
and it happens the way you want.     
Either it happens through     
your own resources, time, money, efforts, etc     
or someone gives you or it happens by chance     
that is immaterial to the definition of success.    
    
Sometimes people associate the timing of success,     
resources used for success and     
location of success as success criteria.    
    
For example, I must pass my exam     
without external help (resources) this month (time)     
from my home town (location)    
    
Wise people plan for success and     
unwise don’t plan or don’t work the plan but want success.     
Luck may favor sometimes wise and sometimes unwise.    
    
That time if a wise person thinks     
my planning was not needed for this success     
then it is not correct thinking.     
And if an unwise or lazy person thinks that     
success is by chance,     
see I got for which other struggles whole life,     
it is also not correct thinking.    
    
Leaving actions to God and waiting for the results of fate     
without action is not a way of a devotee.     
After putting your best efforts, leaving results or fruits of action     
to fate and God is wiser thinking.    
    
O Pratibimba, what is success for you?     
Who decides success for you?     
What is the role of action and fate in success?     
Is it necessary to be successful in life?     
Is living life without any self-defined goal, not success itself?

# Article5154 : What Is Death?    
tags: [ Death, Life, 'Mad Thinking', Philosophy]    
    
Namaste,    
    
Death cannot be understood     
without dwelling on the term called life.    
    
When a pot comes in shape from mud     
do you call that pot a new life?     
When milk turned into curd     
do you call that curd a new life?     
When a seed breaks the cover and becomes a sprout     
do you call that sprout a new life?     
When burned skin is healed on the body     
do you call that new skin a new life?     
When air or water moves in space     
do you call that life is moving in space?     
When a train moves on the track,     
do you call that life is moving on the track?     
When something falls on the ground and bounces back     
do you call that football a life?    
    
In a sentence, we have a noun and verbs.     
Without a verb can you compose a meaningful sentence?     
Think about a sentence full of verbs without nouns!    
    
Without nouns about whom you are talking about?     
The names of the objects around are nouns.     
Their actions are verbs.    
    
But how do the actions happen?     
Who inspires the actions to become a move,     
or become something different?     
What is the inspiration behind transforming a seed into a sprout?     
What is the inspiration or force behind a moving train?     
What is the inspiration behind milk becoming curd?    
    
Where is that inspiration of becoming something else?     
Is that inspiration in the nouns?     
Is it coming from outside of the boundary of that object?    
    
Can life be ever dead?     
Can dead ever be life?     
Dead is always dead.     
Life is always life.    
    
Is an apple a life or not?     
Is a fish life or not?     
Is the statue of mud life or not?     
Are your hair, nail, tooth, or pee have life or not?     
Where is the life in your body or in any body?     
Can it be located?     
What is life made of?    
    
How do we perceive that life is dead?     
Because that is not physically     
available before us to play or interact?    
    
If technology digitizes your body and mind     
and after your death your great-grandchildren     
reconstruct you fully from the technology     
and communicate with you in that new avatar that is life or not?     
Is this avatar the same life who died many years ago or different?    
    
What takes birth, grows, deteriorates,     
becomes old, and die is a body.     
With life inside the body, all these verbs     
or processes or play happens in the noun, body.    
    
A noun is a noun. A verb is a verb.     
Both are important simultaneously.     
Death is like a noun, it is fixed and unchanging.     
Life is like verb gives an impression that objects are moving.    
    
The verb can be moved     
from one sentence to another     
wherever they go makes sentences meaningful.    
    
Life is like that it moves from one place to another.     
One body to another in whatever body it goes     
it makes that living.     
But it doesn’t mean mud has become life.     
It is an illusion.    
    
So “life dies” is a meaningless sentence.     
It is like saying dry water.     
“Dead becoming life” is also a meaningless sentence.    
    
Because of our sensory perceptions,     
we get deceived by the nature.     
Like we are every day getting an illusion     
that we are on a fixed plane called earth.     
Rise of the sun, blue sky, etc many illusions     
happening around and we think it is the reality.     
We think it is fact.     
Death is not a fact but a conclusion of the human mind     
because of an illusion of his own perception.    
    
So don’t ask the question, what happens after death?     
Where were we before birth?     
Both are wrong questions.    
    
If someone asks where were I before my birth.     
That is a more sensible question.     
But the answer to that is     
without your physical body, you lived like darkness     
which is everywhere and not a particular place.    
    
Light is a limited identity.     
It comes into existence and goes off.     
Darkness is natural in the cosmos, wide, and omnipresent.     
Wherever darkness fails to go dark is always there.    
    
(There is no answer here in this write-up but an inspiration to think madly)

But you can see a section of line straight on a piece of paper.     
You can see two sections of lines parallel on a paper.     
If you extend the line beyond the page in the space     
you will be surprised to know it is forming a circle.     
Unfortunately, we don't have that much life or     
that long paper to draw on the canvas and we conclude the line is straight.     
    
You apply this logic to other aspects of existence including your life.     
You will realize life looks like a straight line from birth to death.     
But if you learn to look at a larger canvas of time and space     
you will know it is a circle.     
Everything in the existence is cyclical     
and human life is not any different.     
    
Life is a circle of infinite birth and death.     
In a nutshell, Vedanta says, in human life,     
people should learn to experience this circle     
and find out a way to exit from this circle.     
That is what they call Moksha.     
The exit from the circular movement!     
    
When people have a short memory,     
or cannot see the larger canvas of life     
then even those who think life is a circle     
They feel life is great when all is going as they wished.     
And they think infinite circular rides are exciting.     
In that case, the lows or highs of life are accepted graciously     
without crying or prayers, and complaints.     
But, there are some who wish to put stop on this.     
    
May this Deepavali we experience     
the circle of festivals, Yuga, Yuga Dharma, and Rama of various Yugas.     
May we experience the circle of our life.     
More than Dhana Lakshmi, Vidhya Lakshmi guide us     
on the path of this Wisdom.     
Because most have enough to be comfortable     
but not enough understanding of this circle     
to be joyful under all the bouncers of life.     
    
Have a happy and safe Deepavali.

# Article5161 : Training of the mind    
tags: [ Mind, Education]    
    
Namaste,    
    
Since the first of our life     
All parts and systems of our body are designed,     
developed, trained, used, and maintained     
in such a way that survival of the life is kept     
at the helm of everything, we do or create.    
    
Mother nature teaches that to us.    
Our parents and friends teach us this.    
Our teachers and instructors teach     
that to us in the classroom and playground.    
    
Survival of life is possible only when our body survives.    
That is how our understanding of life is.    
    
If body survival is that supremely important for us     
then everyone around us should be used to survive our individual bodies.    
The mind has been trained in such a way     
that everything around is different and     
you need to protect yourself from it.    
    
Our education systems, exam, Society, government, and     
even religious practices are giving that training.     
Everyone from the first-day life is teaching     
survival of the body is extremely important.     
And we are learning mental, verbal, and action tricks for survival.    
    
The boundary of the body is important     
when the environment is hostile    
When you are living in the forest    
When you are living with an enemy    
When you are living with people who don't like you.    
But, why the survival of the body is on top priority     
when you are living with your loved one?    
Or when you are living alone in a safe environment?    
    
Our mind training is very deep,     
we are not able to drop this survival instinct     
even for a while when we are sleeping.    
    
When the whole system is teaching survival     
even in the comforts of the 21st century,     
even in your safe home then how to experience     
your existence, which is beyond the body?    
    
In life, when survival need is taken care of then     
people could have thought of self-realization.    
But by that time it is too late, in old age,     
the mind is trained so much differently     
and it has become so hard to unwire     
that a normal person cannot do it.     
This training of the mind for survival is very expensive.    
    
The price is suffering in a comfortable environment.    
The price is suffering when you don't have anything     
which is challenging your survival.    
Body identification is the price     
that humanity pays for suffering and missing Liberation.

# Article5162 : The Biggest Mistake    
tags: [Life, Education ]    
    
Namaste,    
    
When we are children we even see the rise and set of the sun with amazement.    
Flying birds, and the color of the clouds and sky spark curiosity in us.    
Even a sprouting plant from seed was an amazement for us.    
    
We asked questions and people around us answered all those questions.    
Because they memorized those answers.    
Either from the course books or lectures or preaching.    
All this is second-hand knowledge.    
Most of them answered all the questions from memory.    
    
We thought these people were wise, they know everything.    
Slowly when we become elder and the children around us     
asked questions then we depended upon those answers which we remembered.    
    
If we don't know the answer we search on the internet    
and answer our children.    
This is the way we learned about this world.    
This is the way we taught our children.    
Almost all people are speaking from second-hand knowledge     
without any first-hand experience of the world around us.    
    
Is it bad to speak from memory and help others find answers?    
No, it is not bad, provided we don't have access     
to the lab to experiment and know the answer firsthand.    
    
There are many things around we cannot know     
from our experiments because it is not easy     
to set up the experiments and know directly     
so it is ok to remember them like formulas.     
At least understand the concept.    
    
Fortunately, there are many answers which we could have known     
by our own experiments even if someone tells us.    
    
When a child gets puzzled over some complicated question about nature    
and you don't know the answer     
or you cannot explain then you can tell him God did this.    
    
When a child asks a question about God or challenges God    
then we shut him by saying don't question God.    
God is the supreme authority, knows everything, most powerful    
If you ask these stupid questions then     
He may get angry and punish you.    
This is how we kill curiosity.    
    
After some time when a child becomes a young man and a woman     
Then he pretends like he knows everything.    
He is not interested in knowing the answer to anything     
from his first-hand experience     
because he knows everything from his memory.    
Remaining whatever he doesn't know     
either he is not interested in those questions or he says God did it.    
    
The biggest problem with religious books or teachers is     
they killed this curiosity in humans.    
They help in making a good ethical human being     
but a person who is not interested in seeking anything.     
    
This grown-up man knows that his master can answer all the questions.     
That answer is God did it     
or God did it this way     
or It is the desire of God.    
Thus, the chapter on seeking is closed.    
This is the biggest mistake in our education system     
which creates a learned man but not a wise man.     
Those who know lots of facts but not the realized ones.

That mango is good for some purposes and bad for others.    
    
A ripe mango fell on the ground and mixed with cow dung.     
It remains there for some time and it gives birth to a new tree.    
    
Which mango is absolutely good and which mango is absolutely bad?    
    
You take any object around you    
It may have some utility in your life or     
you may think that it is useless for me.    
You may think it is not good for me or     
it is not good for may    
    
But this all depends upon your previous experience    
You think it is good for you or bad for you    
It is harmful or beneficial for me    
Same object in one situation of life or at one place     
or with one person may be bad     
but in different circumstances it looks useful and good.    
    
Where is the goodness or badness?    
Is it an integral part of objects?    
Our utilitarian mind judges things as good or bad.    
Based on our current state of mind,     
and experience we label objects as good and bad.    
    
There is a world around us    
We all label the objects of the world     
based on the utility we see in those.    
    
What utility is good or bad?    
It depends upon our mind,     
our exposure to different diverse situations of life,     
upon our mood at the time     
when that object comes in contact with our life.    
    
O Chaitanya, without labeling the things around,    
What kind of world exists around?    
With your and mine we pollute real things around us.    
With your and mine we decorate these things in our mind.    
    
Is it possible to see the world around     
the way it exists and without our labeling efforts?    
    
Have you ever experienced the world that way?    
Do you know your body is also one object of the world like your clothes?    
    
Do you know there is a way to experience the body?    
It helps you, knowing your vastness    
it helps you, breaking the boundary    
of your existence within the skin cover of your body.    
It helps you, dropping your fear.    
It helps you, knowing your immortality.    
    
Do you not want to experience that real existence of your Self,    
which is beyond your labels of good-bad, heaven - hell and Paap Punya?

# Article5165 : How to Evaluate IQ    
tags: [Education ]    
    
Namaste,    
    
After spending a decade in training, consulting, Coaching and mentoring activities I started believing that the IQ of a person should not be measured on the basis of facts, what a person knows. In fact in this information age when search engines know more facts than any single human it is an outdated way of measuring IQ.    
    
Corporations are spending a lot of money in selecting good candidates for the role in their projects and organization but they are also not going beyond question answers interviews or a standard exam. Most of the time MCQ are the criteria of evaluating. In a limited time how can we select a good candidate?    
    
If you throw some facts before a candidate, and ask him to propose some unique interesting questions. That can be a good assessment of a thinking mind. What kind of thought and mind he has. In the next step ask him to get the answer to those questions. This shows what he has done in the past.    
    
Does he feel excited in asking those questions or feeling that these are rhetorical questions? Does he feel excited in solving those or has he memorized some answers and repeating from memory.    
    
In the process of gaining experience and learning something new we need to use memory. For what purpose we use memory is an important thing. Most people use memory to remember facts; they use it to “retain” concepts. Why? Because they don't “learn” concepts and ideas. For most people, the purpose of reading books is getting more facts and information, they rarely focus on ideas.     
    
To evaluate the IQ, let's see one example, how to ask questions from the facts.    
Facts:     
1. Earth completes rotation around the sun in 365 days.     
2. Circle is 360 degree angle.     
3. Day has 24 hours.     
4. Moon completes one rotation around earth in 28 days.     
5. There are four seasons in Delhi.    
    
Using the above facts, ask as many questions and propose as many answers. Avoid rhetorical questions. If you ask a question which is asked by many other people then you get lesser points. Lessor times that question is asked more points you get.     
    
Possible Questions:    
How many degrees does the earth rotate in a day?    
How many latitude and longitude shifts happen on earth in one hour?    
How much does the moon rotate around the earth in one hour? What is the rotation on a full moon day on the equator?    
    
One of the biggest problems of our education is they are giving lots of facts, expecting learners to memorize the answer, learners remember the facts and information but they are ignoring information. They don’t know how to use that information. The main reason for that is they are not asking the right questions.    
    
I am not against the memorization of facts. If someone can remember facts that is great. But the greatest thing is assimilate information, stitch the facts together and know what is not obvious.

Namaste,    
    
When you see sun is rising and settings    
But you know it doesn't    
    
Approx 72 inch is human body height    
One inch in eye size    
One tenth is size of pupil in the eye    
A small dust particle is enough to stop us seeing the world around    
But we can big objects around and compare    
From eyes we know a cow is bigger than a goat    
Goat is bigger than cat    
Cat is bigger than mouse    
Mouse is bigger than ant    
Ant is bigger than sugar particle    
None of these objects or their sizes     
exists in our mind    
Still we can compare    
Retina of eye convert light signals to electric signals    
Brain processes electric signals    
Processing of these signals is chemical process    
Process is same for all human being    
But even after that     
we all understand the world in different way    
It is Maya.    
    
We see around thousands of broken heart    
Thousands of broken marriage    
Thousands of cheating and deceiving around.    
But we still want get married, still have friends, relations    
This is Maya.    
    
We have not seen our great grandparents    
We know we have come from those human    
We know they have disappeared    
We know we will also disappear at one moment    
But we still behave like we are permanent here.    
    
We know great Kings of earlier time had huge wealth,     
empire, power, Large families, buildings etc.    
Today we don't see those kings around    
Probably their great grandchildren are begging on the roads.    
But we still want to work and earn like     
Our earnings can make our children and great grandchildren safe.     
This is Maya.     
    
We buy insurance, pension, large houses    
Big cars, beautiful foreign destination     
to buy comfort and hope happiness will come,    
Security will come.     
We know many are suffering even after having all these    
But we still want to have more.     
This is maya.     
    
Couple see many parents are abundant by their children     
Many children have been suffering since childhood.     
Many accidents and tragedies bring pain for the whole family.     
Many mistreat their parents.     
Abuse their property and compromise values and positions.     
But we still see happiness in having children     
This is maya.     
    
We have taken birth.     
Grown up and matured enough.     
If we understand the maya clearly.     
Then there is nothing to do.     
There is no goal, no work, even basic earning for survival looks meaningless     
It looks like there is nothing else to do in the world.     
    
Now, when we are just sitting idle without any work,    
we feel let's go and play    
In the process of play we get entangled in the game.     
We got to the extent that we want to own the playground and other players.     
We want to determine the rules of the game in the playground.     
This is maya.     
    
One day when we are kicked out of the playground     
Then we realize, play was real our attitude towards     
the playing caused us all pain, suffering and miseries.     
    
O Chaitanya, play well    
Ready to drop whatever you acquired through your hard play.    
Your giving, taking, producing all are happening in Maya.

# Article5167 : About Friendship     
tags: [ Life, Friendship]    
    
Namaste,     
    
The definition of friendship in real life is not the same as in social media. In the age of social media Connecting relatives, colleagues, like minded people is considered friendship. It has its own utility. Having relationships like spouse, children, parents, uncle, aunt doesn't mean friendship. Friendship is a special relationship. In every life very few relations deserve to qualify for that special friendship. Otherwise all are transactions of give and take depending upon time, place, and situation. The role of people can change from squeezer to squeezed.     
    
It takes time to build relationships, some come from bloodline, but they can spoil because of a few abnormal transactions.     
    
A friend is that person, whose name fills your mind with peace, security. A name, which drops formality and brings a feeling of care. A name with which you feel, it is beyond logic and beyond your physical existence. A name that brings a smile to your face.    
    
With whom you need not to prove.    
With whom you don't feel high nor low.    
With whom you feel he or she is part of your emotional existence.    
    
One, whose physical existence around gives a feeling of light heartedness.    
Even if he/she is not physically available you can feel him or her in your mind.    
Whose body and mind you don't want to mess with but he/she energizes you.    
    
If you ask something from your friend and it is not given then you understand there must be a valid and good reason and it must be good for either me or for our friendship.    
    
Friendship of the following is very dangerous and can break you unexpectedly.     
    
Highly emotional people, a person who fluctuates too much.     
Who don't know/remember what they said, and just busy in saying anything for the heck of saying. Many times out of habit people say “I love you”, they don’t feel it. This word doesn’t shake them.    
Who doesn't keep his words.     
Don't have the ear to listen to others.     
Dull in mind but try to be clever    
Cannot reason properly    
Are too much unsecured    
Don't have time to know, discuss, share but always jump to conclusion    
Those who depend upon others to have friendship with you.    
So low in their self esteem that they need others to remind them of their value.     
Looks reason to torture themselves or others or relationships.    
People who show themselves too busy or too important before you.     
    
Every life has its own experiences of friendship. Every life deserves a good friend. They get this kind of friend or not, it is all fate.     
Chemistry in friendship is much more important than physics of have and have not. Depending upon an individual's emotional and intellectual material they find they can find their own good friend.     
    
In friendship keep in mind.    
Don't judge people unless you are a paid judge in a court.     
Don't test people; they are not your test agent.

Bondage is of two types, physical and mental. Either you put yourself in this bondage or system around you puts you in that bondage. In the bondage either you are happy or not. Either you have any hope of coming out of that bondage or not. You may have a desire to come out of that bondage or not. The treatment may be in your hand or not.     
    
Physical bondage has names like Jail, Hostage, confinement, tapasya etc depending upon what you think.     
    
Mental bondage has names like boredom, monotony, madness, loneliness, feeling cheated, feeling used and thrown etc.     
    
Whatever is the situation to know you are free or bondage you need understanding of events, things, relations around in the present time.

You go before a mirror for various reasons. When you have doubt, when there is a curiosity, when someone compliments or points something out or just for the time-pass.    
    
When you are before the mirror and the mirror is clean then you can never miss your image while looking there. Here are three entities: you, mirror and your image in the mirror.     
    
While seeing an image if you find some spot in the image then either you clean the mirror or you clean your face. But you cannot do anything directly with the image.    
    
Your mind is like a mirror, your karma is like a real object and your experience is like an image in the mirror.     
    
If the mind is settled, peaceful, calm, clean then you can never miss seeing your true image there. Now if you find some defects in that image then either you clean the mirror i.e. mind or clean your face i.e. Karma.    
    
What is the use of saying and repeating I am sinful, dirty etc. Nobody can give you a better experience, if your Karma gives you bad experience then clean the Karma. But there are people who keep cleaning a mirror and hoping for a better image.

Who is that unseen which is the cause of this perfection?    
    
Do not point your finger towards the sky, and objectify that absolute subject and creator.     
    
Do not deny that you have no contribution in this perfection.

When you are sleeping you are conscious but not aware. Body parts which make life, like tissues, cells and protein have awareness. Do molecules, atoms, electrons, protons, and neutrons have awareness? Does the earth, moon, sun and other stars have awareness? Ancient eastern wisdom says the cosmos is not dead therefore even the sky has awareness.    
    
Even after death, for sometime some body parts are conscious locally but body level awareness is lost.    
    
We know awareness is the result of consciousness but at what level of existence do objects become self aware or surrounding aware?     
    
Answers are extremely hard even after so much advancement of science. It looks that because everything is conscious so everything is self aware and environment aware as well. It means even a stone and a piece of furniture is self aware. Question is only of degree. Because it is extremely low self aware therefore it cannot be measured. Like advanced MRI machines can help you measure the kind and degree of human emotions and awareness.

# Article5172 : Play on your Strength    
tags: [Life ]    
    
Namaste,    
    
Mentally or physically everybody has a unique design. Either you or someone else can identify that uniqueness of yours. If you know this then you can live a more meaningful life. Otherwise, you have a feeling of living in a pressure cooker called world and competing with others.     
    
A boy who has an extraordinary length of hands and small legs is generally ugly looking man. Fortunately nobody told him nor he told himself that I need to become a pilot or serve in the army or become a hollywood star. He knew his limitations but somebody discovered his strength.     
    
This kind of body is not designed to run on earth or fly in the air. This is designed to rule the water. And lo! He became 28 times olympics medal winners in swimming. He is Michael Fred Phelps II.     
    
The purpose of sharing this is neither to inspire you to become a swimmer or olympic winner or nobel prize winner. Nor the purpose is to let you feel bad that I have spent my whole life and I couldn't become x or y and I couldn’t earn z amount of money. The purpose is to inspire you to know about your physical and mental strength and work only on that. Whether you earn name, fame and money or not, you will be able to get away from the rat race and do something unique. Unfortunately most people do the reverse, they decide how much money and land I need to live a happy and secure life and they spend the whole life grudgingly in earning that.

# Article5173 : Helpless Krishna and Missing Arjuna     
tags: [Bhagwat Gita, Life ]    
    
Namaste,     
    
The truth is Bhagwat Gita was told by a friend Krishna to his best friend Arjuna. That too when he asked.     
    
Normal chit chat is fine but serious advice should not be given to your friend, if it is not asked. Today's situation is such, we give suggestions to everyone, even to the unknown. Shaking someone for the reality so that one can search one's truth is one thing but telling one the absolute truth, without asking, is not good practice.     
    
Today there are people who are ready to teach Bhagwat Gita but Arjuna is missing from war field, sometimes Arjuna is there but he is so arrogant that he doesn't ask his friend who can teach, other times he casually ask and wisdom is given but Arjuna doesn't pay heed. Most of the time Arjuna in the war field thinks anything but Bhagwat Gita is the solution of today's kurukshetra. So he does everything but doesn't come to the point and suffers in the whole war.     
    
Most Hindus are not interested in teaching, memorizing any book of any sect or religion. If you teach them then most ignorant will ask you practical questions. What is in it for me, don't preach me heaven, hell and god. Please solve today's problem. And this is that idea which should be highly appreciated in any practical man.     
    
Even Vedas, Upnishads were not taught to all. Those who have strong desires to go through tough tests in gurukul entrance exam and then only admission. But even after that they all were Sanatani.     
    
Today's religion says if you do not believe in X or Y, A book or B book, C son of God or 'A' one and only ultimate God you will go to eternal hell on judgment day. What is the nonsense going on in this 21st century? Especially when we are saying we are an advanced civilization. Unfortunately in this competition Sanatani also joined because they think answers need to be given in the language other religions understand.     
    
Survival is fine, social work is a great cause, unity is wonderful but this is not the way to realize the Truth.

# Article5174 : Appreciate the Architecture of Mind     
tags: [ Mind, Meditation]    
    
Namaste,     
    
We blame the mind like a monkey, it keeps dancing and makes the body and the world around dance and create problems.     
    
See the beauty of mind, it can dance and without your notice, it can leap to a completely unrelated subject, location and time. Without this capability of mind no creativity is possible. No 'hope' is possible. No temporary relief from present problems is possible.     
    
Problem is not that the mind jumps or takes leaps. In fact this is a good design feature of mind. Problem is stickiness. Whether good or bad it gets hooked, stuck to the surface of that object, idea, relation, event etc. Now it behaves like an innocent child, the moment you give some new temptation, it will forget old, at least temporarily. This is a good part of the mind architecture but again it is possible because it has the ability to jump.     
    
If we don't know how to handle a product then we complain about the product even if that particular function may be a feature of the product and the manufacturer has put that feature with great effort.     
    
Rather than complaining about architecture or blaming the manufacturer, why don’t you learn to use the product.     
    
Mind is not created by any local unbranded manufacturer and it is created almost the same for all humans. Some use and maintain it badly and some become Buddha with their mind..

tags: [ Indian Culture, Education]    
    
Namaste,     
    
Joint Families, where each family, Kula, has a Guru and elders. Land belongs to those who can cultivate and feed others. Knowledge belongs to those who can enhance and benefit others with his knowledge. Power belongs to those who can protect others with their power. And money belongs to those who trade with other societies for the benefits of their society. Children belong to the whole village and whole family.     
    
Temple is a place where a Bhakta and his Aradhya live together. Other Bhakta come to meditate and offer praise and flowers. Nobody other than devotee sleep and live permanently in temple premises    
    
Gurukul, an infrastructure to impart knowledge of sciences and arts. Where Guru lives permanently. Students may also live but they live there to learn and serve.     
    
Dharamshala, an infrastructure created by rich man or village people's efforts or king's money. Any travelers can live there. It is not a permanent place for any but maintained by either village or king.     
    
Forest is a place where anyone can go alone for his meditation. Knowing all the suffering of the forest he put realization above all the suffering he felt in the world.     
    
Mission and Matha were first conceived by Mahatma Buddha. The purpose was Sadhana of Bhiksu and teaching Dhamma, teaching of Buddha. It is either maintained by a king or Bikshu by begging from the village.     
    
By the time we reached the 21st century it was all topsy-turvy. Today the whole society in the race of secularism has become like this.    
    
In place of family we have beautifully maintained buildings and houses. Maximum 2 or 4 people living. All are running to maintain the beauty of the house. Children     
either belong to the father or mother forget about society or village.     
    
In place of Dharamshala we have hotels.     
In place of gurukul we have secular school and college with a standard education.     
    
In place of temple we have a place for picnic or god service centers     
In place of Mission or Matha we have a mission for conversion, center of politics.

# Article5176 : Ideals in Hinduism     
tags: [ Hinduism, Ethics and Morality]    
    
Namaste,     
    
People Question Rama, why he left Sita because someone questioned Sita's character? Rama should have defended and continued as king.    
    
Do you remember once Uma took the form of Sita to test the divinity of Rama. But, just because Shiva had seen Sita in Uma for a short time, he denounced Uma as wife and said you are my Mother now because Rama is my Aradhya. Such are the ideals in Hinduism. Post this event she went to her father's house and in some incident jumped into fire. Shiva became disturbed and he destroyed Yagnya of Daksha. He carried Uma on her shoulders for many years and finally Vishnu cut the dead body into pieces. Post this Shiva goes to long Meditation.     
    
The dead body of Uma, which was on the shoulders of Shiva, was of mother of Shiva or wife of Shiva?     
    
Why do we question only Rama and not Shiva? Because Shiva was not King?     
    
Shiva is Gruhastha first or ascetic first? Definitely not regular Sanyasi!     
    
When Shiva is our ideal then what happened to our society where flirting with any woman is normal behavior of man, otherwise you are treated as abnormal? Can you even think of our Ideals doing so?

# Article5177 : Business of Quotations     
tags: [Concepts, Information ]    
    
Namaste,     
    
When you are convinced of something then to convey that experience you use words. Because you do not have credibility to be believed so you refer from the best seller books, holy books, from your guru's books etc. After this you think, your experience is transmitted to others.     
Fortunately the human mind doesn't work that way and the message is still not gone. See around how many holy books, Guru-Vaakya, best selling books, are existing. How many people “truly” believe in those books?     
    
If you have conviction on your truth then why to use others as a gun to fire your bullet? Can't we be honest and straight to speak even our own tapasya and realization? And for that, most of humanity is peddling and recycling the same old information and they don't have time to realize even iota of that, which they are referring to in the book.     
    
In Indian culture we never had that tradition of quotations. We have a culture of "sayings", "proverbs", "kim-danti", "lok-katha", "sloka" but we don't believe blindly on those. No matter who said whether Guru or Devta or Devi or God. No matter where it is written we still apply our mind and then navigate our life. We have a shraddha for all, for the initial period of time when you are entering into that school of thought or gurukula. But living your whole life on those written words and keeping your intellect in a locker is not part of Hindu culture.     
    
People from Abrahmic religion refer to books and treat their books sacrosanct. Every time saying it is written in that book, our messenger said this, it is said by big scientists or politicians or great guru etc. It means, I don't have the guts to say that truth or don't have necessary experience.     
    
In these situations does it make sense to say anything, which we want to say? Can't we remain silent and do Tapasya to experience that truth and then say it? Is it a fear of copyright violation or fear of not getting acceptance? We all are maintaining a timestamp about who said it, when it was said, in which book it is said.

# Article5178 : Why Do We Do Namaste?    
tags: [ Indian Culture, Concept, Namaste]    
    
Meaning of Namaste    
    
Namaste means, I bow down to you.    
    
Normally, you can bow down to some because that person is powerful. Or, out of her/his power, either she/he can give or punish you. So out of that fear you do Namaste. This is Vyapar Drushti. My business will lose if I don't pay my due.    
    
Second reason for Namaste may be wisdom. Because of someone's behavior you learn that he or she is wise and his presence makes your life experience rich. He can help you dive deeper in life so because of that greed you bow down to someone. This is Swakalyan Dristi. I will grow if there is grace of this person upon me.    
    
Third reason may be habits, which are given to us by our culture. Out of habit we do Namaste. It doesn't have much meaning or depth. It is like you are driving your car and out of habit whenever you see a traffic light or traffic police you slow down or stop, even without desire. Sometimes meaningless but yes this is how we are trained in training school or on the road by earlier drivers. This is Sanskar Drushti. People will call me bad if I don't follow the rules of the game.    
    
Final reason for doing namaste is I have seen something deeper in you. The same tattva which I am, Atma Tattva. As a body I bow down before that Tattva. Although that Tattva is in me and you and all life around. Yet whenever I see some life moving around, it may be a cow going by, or a flower in the garden, or tree standing around, or a lovely laughing/ joyful face going before me, I experience that Tattva in me. I see there is life, and hence there is that same tattva behind, which is moving me. Hence I do namaskar to that Tattva. This is Gyan Drushti.    
    
Your body and my body both have come from the same soil. Every day it is recycling. Body is always dead, Atmatattva keep it live. Therefore a body that came 20 years before or some came 20 years after doesn't make any difference from Atmatattva or Atmabodha perspective. Because Atma is never born and never dies. Which has not born is ageless and actually everyone is that ageless being. It is different that this truth never comes in our experience like the speed of earth never comes to our experience but truth is, the earth runs around the sun at 1.10 lakh kilometers/hours.     
    
What kind of namaste or namaskar, you do or expect from others? You can ask yourself.    
    
But good morning is completely meaningless. Somebody had fought with his or her spouse in the morning, you ignorantly saying morning is good, does he even have that experience at that moment? He will simply repeat the words out of etiquettes.

# Article5179 : Why is life complex?    
tags: [Life, My Views ]    
    
    
Instinct is something which every life has on this planet.     
And it helps them in their survival.     
If survival is the goal of life then instinct is good enough.    
    
But human has two other great capabilities     
which other animals don't have.     
These are the capabilities of reasoning and intuition.    
    
Most of the people are suffering from a disease called busyness.     
So, they don't get time to pause and think about the meaning of life.    
Therefore they use these two functions also for survival     
and the tragedy is that your whole life goes like this.     
    
Up until the last breath they wish something else     
could have been done or     
that could have been done in better way    
to make life more comfortable     
or better than their next neighbor or their challenger.     
    
But all these questions come from our desire to survive better.     
This is how we create unnecessary fuss and drama     
around the simple things of life     
and cry life has become complex.    
    
When you use powerful tools     
to solve the simple survival problem of life     
then it is like using a sword to sew your torn shirt.     
What will you get? tatters!    
    
But people don't get this simple point of using     
wrong tool throughout their entire might to make life comfortable     
Or make it more rich, so they keep suffering their whole life.    
    
If comfort was the goal then rich and comfortable people     
like Siddhartha, Nanak Sahib, Meera were fool     
to pause and seek something more meaningful?     
They went out of their physical comfort and     
struggled enough to get that     
which gives unshaken peace even to face the worst of life.

# Article5180 : There is no God!    
tags: [My Views, Theist ]    
    
    
If our Karma and Law or Karma is everything then what is the need of God?    
    
People say Karma is everything but they are afraid of this rule. They want to bypass this rule. Why? Due to ignorance or madness, if some Karma happened and results of that Karma is unbearable then what to do?    
    
They thought saying sorry should be a solution. But where to go and say sorry and who will forgive? Thus culture invented a big father concept, called God. Go and please Him, say sorry to Him and He will forgive you.    
    
Once God is there then people can become irresponsible they can do all nonsense and put a mercy petition before God. Or they can ask all kind of questions, like why I am suffering I am great devotee, I am good person, I have done so much donation, I have helped so many people, I am hard working person, I am honest, I have done three times prayer every day etc. So why am I suffering?    
    
They feel God is responsible for their misery in life. Even after so much donation at a temple or orphanage if I am suffering then what is the use of all this good Karma.    
    
Because they don't find any other responsible person around, with whom they talk or pull in the court for their misery, so they become atheist. As if God will become any less by this act or their misery will reduce. As long as human life is there whether you are rich or poor, married or single, have children or childless you all suffer. God has nothing to do with your businesses and worldly designations and positions. But, unfortunately humans need God only for these transactions because they don't know anything else other than this kind of business.    
    
If this is the state of affairs then even a so-called happy devotee is doing business with God but his business is going good. One day when he loses money, health, relationship, people, social or temple respect he will also become atheist.    
    
O Chaitanya, how to raise human consciousness so that they realize that even beyond the losses and profit of his life, life around in the cosmos is extremely complex and we don't know how all this is happening smoothly? There is someone, there is something, which we want to know through our efforts and not from the books or temples or preachers. But for that they need to pause for a moment from their daily race which is taking them from birth to death. Their race of endless Karma and rituals.

tags: [ Vedanta, My Views]    
    
    
Birds, Animals and Human all breath     
and exists as long as they breath    
But only humans are aware of his own existence.    
Other exists but with with limited awareness,     
which is good enough for survival.    
    
Because human is aware about his existence (I am)    
So asking the next question is natural for humans.    
That question is "Who Am I"    
Because of limited self awareness it is not possible     
for birds and animals to ask this question.    
    
Many human ask this questions,     
But they don't have rigor, grit, or patience to seek the answer.    
Due to this reason they ask their scripture, books, parents and teachers.    
And memorize the answer for the next generation.    
Because of this memorized answer nothing changes in life.    
    
If you try it on your own then even     
half answer will bring some peace in life.    
Otherwise the correct and perfect copied answer is of no use.    
    
This peace will not be a peace of animals or birds     
Who are happy after eating, drinking, sleeping and sex.    
This peace is that will take your own existence beyond     
day to day fight with family members, colleagues, government or god.    
    
This peace has power to give a realization     
that you are the center of an infinite vast existence.    
This peace has power to give a fearless life     
where you cannot do anything inappropriate.    
    
This peace does not bother about social morality,    
Neither bother about the fear and temptations of hell and heaven.    
This peace allow you feel your existence     
beyond five elements from which your body is made of.

Love, Respect, and Trust are     
the foundation of any relationship.    
You name any relation like your Ishta, mother, father,     
guru, wife, husband, son, daughter, daughter-in-law.    
Remove love, respect and trust from that relationship.    
That relation becomes like dry wood.    
    
You put these three things     
in any unknown relation.    
Even without name that     
relation becomes most valuable.    
So it is not important     
What is the name of the relationship?    
It is important whether Love, Respect, and Trust     
is there in the relationship or     
it has dried away over the age of that relation.    
    
Keep in mind that Love, Respect and Trust is mutual    
But it never means     
you respect me and I respect you.    
You trust me and I trust you.     
You love me and I love you.    
Love, Respect, and Trust mean as an     
individual's your ability     
to Love, Respect, and Trust     
under all circumstances of life.     
No matter what others do to you.    
After all it is your ability.    
    
Circumstances in life     
will take you on a roller coaster ride     
but never ever lose your ability     
to Love, Respect, and Trust.     
People may go away, die and turn into your enemy     
but you should never surrender     
your ability to Love, Respect and Trust.    
Remain full of life.    
Without these three, you cannot breathe freely.

tags: [Indian Culture, Yoga, Meditation, Tantra, Upanishad ]    
    
    
Three the biggest things which Bharat gave to the world     
but even our own people don't understand these fully.    
    
A. Tantra : A way to control your own life energy. Live your every breath. Live life in totality and without duality. Hundreds of Agama Tantra Shastra defines them but unfortunately this is the most misunderstood work of Bharat. Whoever tries to speak boldly on this is either sidelined or he does something nasty and people do not listen to him. Finally it remained in the hands of those who cannot communicate it to the world.    
    
B. Yoga : A way to control your own body. Make your body flexible. It has eight stages to reach to perfection. Purpose was to live a healthy physical life as long as you want. This became so bad that people started linking it to exercise, jogging, body twisting, music, stretching, religion and what not.    
    
C. Upanishad : They are also called Vedanta and Darshan Shastra. In western world they call it the Indian Philosophical system. A way to understand existence at intellectual level. For many it is too complex to decode the meaning. Many of those who could decode this feel hair splitting reasons and too much stress on reasoning is useless. Many cannot take it beyond philosophy and the system of logic. So it ended up in the hands of very few who don't care much about the world and the world doesn't care much about them. Because, today's time is about advertisement, marketing, presentation, demo, and visibility.    
    
Tragedy is those who take interest in science and technology don't soak themselves, to understand and connect well between modern science and these systems. They conveniently pick up random experiments of science or statements of scientists and justify their thinking. The vigor required to understand ancient Bhartiya work and modern science is either missing or insincere.

Darkness in the whole existence is natural.    
It need not be created.    
Darkness is universal.    
But by effort if you can bring light     
then darkness disappears!    
    
Where does it go?     
Does it get contracted or Displaced?    
If you light all the places then     
will there be lessor darkness     
in the world because it has been displaced?    
    
Like total energy and mass     
of the universe is conserved    
Total darkness and light     
of The Existence is conserved.    
You cannot eliminate darkness by light.    
    
Matter is another form of energy.    
They get transformed into each other.    
Energy replaces matter.    
You see a large iceberg,     
It can be turned into a huge power of steam.    
    
Darkness is another form of light.    
That another form is called absence of light.    
Darkness is light replaced by absence of light.    
    
Energy is more universal than matter.    
Darkness is more universal than light.    
    
Accepting the existence in totality mean     
accepting light and darkness together.     
Without disproportionately appreciating one over other    
Leads to accepting the existence in totality.

# Article5186 : Thinking and Feeling    
tags: [Mind, My Views ]    
    
    
Feeling and Thinking are two different process in human     
And both work from different parts of the human brain.     
Metaphorically people say     
thinking is from the head and feeling from heart.    
    
People say when in conflict between head and heart     
then listen to the heart and not head.    
    
Think deeper, ask yourself     
can you think without feeling anything?    
If that is possible then how it is possible that     
you think about some past event and you become emotional?    
    
Feel deeper, and ask yourself     
can you feel something without thinking about that?    
It that is the possible then     
why do you rationalize feeling of love and hate     
for something or someone?    
    
In reality sometimes you think and then you feel.    
and other times you feel and then think.    
So when in confusion then don't say     
listen to your heart to make a decision.    
    
In that situation, take a long pause,     
think clear, feel deeper and move on.     
Any decision of present can be proved     
wrong or right in the future.     
You don't know what time has in its womb for you.    
    
Sometimes you like those outcomes     
and other times you feel bad.    
It is not because of heart over head.    
There are many forces in life     
Which controls your experiences of good or bad.

# Article5187 : Effect of Maya     
tags: [Vedanta, Maya, My Views ]    
    
    
If there is no object then the presence of light cannot be sensed.     
If there is no environment on earth then the blueness of the sky cannot be sensed.     
    
Human eyes and brain cannot see light     
in the absence of objects and environment.     
    
But still humans out of habit say that we can see light.     
This is the effect of Maya.    
    
For some time, clouds covered the sun.     
After sometime when you see the sun,     
you feel the sun has moved.     
But in reality earth has moved,     
cloud has moved and you have moved     
and the sun is at the same place.     
This is the effect of Maya.    
    
We know money can buy comfort and not the peace,     
We listen so and so rich couldn't     
enjoy his wealth and he passed away,     
Another rich lost everything     
he earned in life before he died.     
Still human helplessly and madly     
runs physical accumulations, comfort.     
This is the effect of Maya.    
    
Our own close friends, relatives and     
colleagues have rejected us     
And still when we are alone     
then either due to compassion     
or due to jealousy we think too much     
about all those who rejected us.     
This is the effect of Maya.    
    
Everyday we see husbands and wives are fighting each other     
Their children are suffering,    
They are going through trauma, rejection     
Still when people see opposite sex and get attracted     
They say we have fallen in love.    
Expecting something different will happen to them    
They get married and the same suffering repeats in their life.    
This is the effect of Maya.    
    
We see there are many people     
who are suffering because of children,    
Either children are not in good health     
or they are not well behaved,    
or they don't listen to their parents,    
or they don't care for family and social values,    
or does something which is heart wrenching for parents     
Still couples wants to have children     
Expecting something different will happen for them.    
This is the effect of Maya.

# Article5188 : Biological Footprint of Human    
tags: [ My Views, Life]    
    
    
Birds fly in the sky without footprint,    
Animals cannot walk on the earth without a footprint.    
Those who want to fly don't create a nest to live but to rest.    
Those who want to walk create a den and die in those dens.    
    
Death happen to birds also    
But, their living noticed by everyone     
and death known to none.    
Death happens to animal also    
They leave a rotten body behind     
for other animals to eat.    
    
Humans create lots of fuss    
Before they leave the planet     
they leave thousands of footprints of different types    
cloths, shoes, pots, electronics,     
ideologies, dogmas, buildings.    
They want other people     
should notice their departure    
But for what?    
    
The biological footprint     
which they created have left havoc here.    
The spiritual footprints     
which they left here     
inspired others to live a sensible life.    
But this is questionable,     
because their followers fight here like animals.

# Article5189 : Bhaav-Vivek Balance    
tags: [Mind, Life ]    
    
    
Bhav (power of emotions) and Vivek (power of intellect)     
both are crucial for a healthy mind.     
If you are too emotional with Vivek you can be dangerous.     
Anyone can twist your mind with some sweet words.     
This can make you fanatic.     
You become ready to kill or get killed, sacrifice others or get sacrificed.     
Whether it is religion or nation or situation or loved one,    
when we are dealing with these, striking a balance is a must.     
    
If you become too intellectual without emotion then you become a robot.     
Logic, instructions, rules is everything for you     
and you ignore human aspects like compassion, love, generosity etc.     
It will disconnect you from your humanity.    
     
Politicians or diplomatic minds exploit these two things.     
And keep in mind even a child is diplomatic.     
Humans need to learn how not to get succumbed and     
then repent because of Bhaav Vivek disbalance.

# Article5190 : Greeting and Culture

What we know, that is because of our efforts     
and the support of family and friends.     
    
What we earn, that is because of our luck and work.    
    
How do we greet and treat others? It is because of culture.    
    
Namaste, Namaskar, Vanakam, Namaskara, Namaskaram, Om and Ram Ram Ji     
is many millennial Indian culture of greeting.     
"Hi", "Good Morning" is western culture.     
There is nothing called cosmic or universal culture.     
Choose when you greet, go slow and know what you mean.    
    
In-office when we have to greet a western person     
it makes sense to say Hi or Good Morning.     
While greeting, it is senseless to tell "good morning" or "Bonjour"    
to your Indian language speaking friend's child.     
It is like an Egyptian mother speaking to her child "Ram Ram Ji".     
Nothing wrong, but pay attention to your culture.    
    
We Indians don’t study the culture the way     
Japanese, Chinese, American, and European do     
but we say our culture is westernized.    
    
The tragedy is the biggest stalwart of leadership     
and communication training fails to notice this.    
They don't understand greeting is part of culture     
and there is nothing called global or universal culture.

# Article5191 : Young Generation and Vedanta    
tags: [Vedanta, Life ]    
    
    
Generally, people think philosophy is for old people.     
Read Bhagwat Gita or Upanishads when you are old.    
I am a youth, I have to live the life I don’t have time for all this useless.    
My child is too small to learn all about these complicated philosophies.    
    
If you face these kinds of questions then the following may help you.    
Ask yourself when Nachikesh of Katho-Upnishad meets Yamaraj    
That time, how old was he?    
    
Ask yourself when Shankaracharya finished all his work     
That time, how old was he? Below 30!    
    
Ask yourself what was the age of Dhruva     
when he had vairagya from Samsara? Below 10!    
    
Ask yourself what was the age of Prahalad     
When he could realize what his father is doing is not correct? Below 16!    
    
Our youth can hide behind giving big names     
and Upadhi to these people by saying they were Avatara of God etc.     
But that is our reasoning to say I will not do it     
because I am convinced that I am not Avatara.     
    
In trouble time, youth is ready to do Puja, Havan, Daanam etc     
in the name of these people,    
but not ready to live that kind of life.     
And this is called hypocrisy!     
This is not how humanity evolves.    
    
    
O Chaitanya, what is the right age     
to study the philosophy of life?     
And who can guide us?

# Article5192 : Are you not Nature?    
tags: [Life, Nature, Vedanta ]    
    
    
If a man thinks he has done something against Mother Nature     
that is why nature is punishing him or going to punish him then     
he forgets that he himself is part of the parcel of nature.     
There is no other separate nature away from your own bodily existence.    
     
Like a leaf is not different from a tree     
and a tree is not different from land     
and land is not different from air, water etc.     
All together is nature.     
    
But this arrogance or ignorance of separateness from     
the nature is seldom found in other creatures on the planet.     
If a leaf could think like you then,     
do you think a leaf falling from a tree branch thinks     
that I have done something wrong against nature that is why I am falling.     
     
Out of our ignorance or wisdom what best or worst a human can do to nature?     
He is part of Nature.     
     
Drinking that water and eating that food which is coming from nature     
then thinking nature is our victim or we need to help nature is not wise thinking.     
    
It is like a deers in the forest thinking a lion is hungry     
so, we need to help the lion, otherwise he may not be able to rule the forest.     
    
Humans better need to understand and fall in place.     
Keeping all religions and science aside     
we need to experientially know that     
we are nothing but a Leaf on a giant tree called earth.     
    
We have come from here. And we will go back to earth to support the tree.     
Body, mind, idea, culture all are recycled in and around us.

# Article5193 : How to Engage for Imparting Knowledge     
tags: [Education ]    
    
    
The biggest counterproductive assumption a teacher     
or a trainer can make about the class is     
"they all know what they want to learn and why they want to learn".     
If so, then the problem is already known.     
Hence, let’s start with a solution and give gyan to these people.     
But this assumption is wrong.    
    
Based on my training experience I can tell     
that most of the people in a class are sitting     
for a degree, certificate or pass to the next class.     
Learning is never the highest motivation.     
    
Throw some real life challenges before them.     
Bring them mentally out from their     
promotion, appreciation, recognition, salary related problems     
and ask them what they think about problem X or Y     
and how do they solve this problem?     
    
Let them give all possible solutions,    
probably the class collectively know     
much better solution than you are going to teach.     
In that situation offer your teaching as an     
alternative solution finder     
rather than giving new knowledge.    
    
But is this easy to bring people     
out from their own created cocoon in the mind and     
offer them the living of the real world?     
    
Sometimes they are surrounded by hundreds of people and     
hundreds of problems but they live in their mental cocoon.    
In that cocoon know they think they have solution     
but other people are not listening to them.    
The solution they have may be useful or useless.    
But till the time solution is discussed,     
debated, agreed it is of no use.

# Article5194 : What is the Miracle?    
tags: [ Life, God, Miracle]    
    
    
When some hot water falls on the body     
and it burns the body,     
burning didn’t happen because of a miracle.    
    
If something hanging at height is cut from the source     
and it falls to the ground.     
The falling didn’t happen because of a miracle.    
    
In the rainy season, if you put a seed in the ground     
and after some time a tree comes out of the seed,     
the new life has not come because of a miracle.    
    
If the earth is revolving around the sun     
then this revolution is not because of a miracle.    
    
If you pickup your cell phone and     
able to talk with somebody in different part of the world     
then talking is not because of a miracle.    
    
If it is still miracle for your in the 21st century     
it means you don’t understand the science behind it.     
Science helps us in understanding the working of nature.     
Nature works the way it exits.    
    
If some good person meets you in life and     
he becomes your partner or good friend,     
then it is a miracle.     
    
Because out of billions of people on this planet     
if you happen to meet someone at any time     
and you become close to him is a matter of probabilities.     
You can calculate the probabilities     
but you cannot tell whether it will happen or not.     
Why it happens to you only, it is unexplainable, so it is a miracle.    
    
A person go to some place and get caught in     
an encounter between security forces and terrorists,     
finally that innocent person is killed. It is a miracle.     
You can give all shallow reasons why that person was killed     
but you cannot truly explain why this incident happened to that particular person.     
It is a game of probability. It is unexplainable, so it is a miracle.    
    
Some so-called good person dies in some accident or     
because of some critical illness.     
It is a game of probabilities,     
you cannot truly explain why that incident happened to that particular person.     
It is unexplainable, so it is a miracle.    
    
Whatever cannot be explained why human,     
he assigns that to his past Karma.     
Some assign this to God.     
Some others assign it to the mysterious way of working of nature.    
Many people think assigning an act of miracle to God will serve the purpose.     
    
In future they will get favor     
or they get strength to go through the trauma of the bad happening     
or they get more chances of good events in their life.     
    
For many this serves their purpose and for others it doesn’t serve.     
The fact is even after so much science     
and so many years on the planet     
We don't know fully how this cosmos works.     
Spiritual people say this cosmos is infinitely intelligent.

# Article5195 : The Meaning of Nishkam Karma    
tags: [ Life, Karma]    
    
    
In the Sanskrit language, the word Kriya means that which happens. Karma means which is done.    
    
Whatever needs to be done for that you need to have your desire and intention. In Sanskrit it is called Sankalp. So without Sankalp, you cannot do any karma.    
    
Karmafala means the outcome of that karma. Karmafala has nothing to do with whether you like it or not, whether it is good for you or bad. For example, you do a karma of eating a brick of ice cream at 6 am in the morning then this karma has karmafala. How ice cream will respond to your body at a particular time depends upon many factors and not just the karma of eating.    
    
When Karmafala has unfolded before you then it is up to you, whether you like it or not. That is another karma and thus the cycle keeps going. Whether you like it or not depends upon you. And how you respond after that like or dislike is 100% your choice.    
    
So karma cannot be done without Sankalp. If this is the case then what is the meaning of selfless karma? Saklap has a deep connection with self. This self can be your body, your child, your parents, your village, your company, your nation, your religion, your community, your race etc.    
    
It looks like selfless karma means karma that is done for a larger self, which has a larger and far radius of impact. This 'far' can be in terms of time or in terms of space.    
    
Nishkam Karma means a Karma, which is done without self desire. But the desire still exists. The desire for a larger self around.    
    
Karma whether for yourself or for the larger self around you. You need a Sankalpa for Karma. Selfless means there is no individual. Where is the question of Karma in that state of mind?    
    
O Pratibimba! What is your experience of selfless Karma and Nishkam Karma?

# Article5196 : Solution of a Problem    
tags: [Life, Vedanta ]    
    
    
There are two worlds around us. One is the real world and another is the projected world. In both worlds objects are the same but their impact on us is different. In the real world, things exist the way they are, as per their Swabhav. In the projected world things exist as per our Swabhav plus the world's interaction (Vyavhar) with us.    
     
For example, a black cat standing before has its own existence whether you are aware of it or not. Whether you think good or bad about it. Whether you feel loving or hateful toward it. This is the real cat of the real world. But within our mind, we have a world and there is also a black cat in that world. This is our own projected world. It is 100% our own creation. How we create this projected world is our own mental karma and this karma will give you Karmafala accordingly. Real cat out can not cause us that much damage as our projected world and its objects.    
     
In the absolute (real, natural) world around us there is no problem. Everything is happening as per the karma of living bodies. Whatever happening is inevitable and the best possible could have happened is happening at the moment. So there is no problem and no solution required.    
     
In the projected world everything is happening as per our own mental karma and we are looking for a solution to fix the problem outside. We can work hard and try to fix it. But it is like putting first aid on the mirror when your cheek is wounded. After treatment, for some time it looks like there is no wound now or it will be healed but as soon as you move on to the mirror you see the wound again. This way you can plaster the whole mirror but the pain is still there on the cheek.    
    
So the projected world doesn't have any permanent or perfect solution. Keep working and moving. Expecting a permanent solution of our worries in the world is like a mirage, water perceived in the desert.

# Article5197 : Time and Present    
tags: [Time, Kaala ]    
    
    
One second is made of 1000 milliseconds.    
One millisecond is made of 1000 microseconds.    
One microsecond is made of 1000 nanoseconds.    
One nanosecond is made of 1000 picoseconds.    
     
So, one second is made of 10^12 picoseconds.    
Thus a picosecond is a very small unit of time.    
     
If you keep going down then you reach a limit of time where time cannot be divided further.    
What is that smallest unit of time of which all times are made?    
     
That time is 10^(-43) second. Scientifically this is the limit of the whole cosmos and existence. There is no less time than this.    
     
Do you know what is the name of this time from which all time of past and future takes birth?    
     
It is called "present". This is timeless and not made of any time. Time is made of this 'present'. "Present" is not time but the mother of all times of past and future.    
     
"Present" is a trillion - trillion - trillion - 10 millionth part of a second.    
     
The funny thing is we commonly say we live in the present. Living means awareness.    
     
Keeping aside all activities if you breathe for 1 second then while breathing you need to be aware trillion - trillion - trillion - 10 million times. Try it someday without counting.    
     
O Chaitanya, can any human do it? That is the reason most of the time either we live in the past or in the future. This past can be 1 microsecond past or 1 picosecond forward future but it is never present.    
     
But the sadhana of living in the present will bring you very close to your existence and reality. Otherwise, most of the time people keep thinking of the previous day, week, month, year, centuries. Thinking about the past using your present is a feature of the mind. But when the past is bothering you too much or making you too nostalgic then choose to live in the present and don't allow yourself to become the victim of time. You are a timeless Atman.

# Article5198 : Indian Technological Advancement with Zero connection to Past    
tags: [Indian Culture, Science ]    
    
    
    
We complain in our society that a Bollywood hero gets quick fame, money, and reputation compared to a great scientist. We need to realize this is where we have brought our great culture of philosophy, debates, metallurgy, astrology, ayurveda, physics, mathematics and all other sciences. In the last 1000 years we couldn't do much even whatever our ancestors have given to us. We worshiped and did pooja aarti of that, put that on our heads and in some puja rooms and temples. But never tried to understand and expand that body of knowledge.    
     
In today's culture people remember singers, composers, dancers, songs, filmy heroes, jokers and entertainers. There is a proper system to award them, celebrate their work, they have an audience for this, and for their work. But almost no recognition, award, audience for scientists (compared to artists). In terms of knowledge in ancient times we were better than today.     
     
Today we are copy paste culture, seeking shortcuts, no ear for listening to our scientists. In this society we expect science to flourish, it is impossible. We may have lots of complaints against western culture but we must appreciate their one point: they respect their scientists, award them, and compensate them properly. Not only that if you go there as a scientist or researcher they respect you.     
     
To verify this, ask people around the name of great Bhakta, Saint, Musician, God incarnation of the last 1000 years you will get many answers. I don't want to put that list here you all know. Ask yourself, are we only doing this work for the last 1000 years or have we done some great work in the field of science and technology. You cannot even remember 3 names. Why? We didn't have those or we don't care for science and technology as our ancestors cared for it.     
     
Today the fourth wave of technology revolution is going on where Indian scientists are. A population of 1.4 billion people doesn't have enough scientific representation. This is a sure short way of slavery to technology dominator of 21st century.

# Article5199 : Three ways of living conscious life    
tags: [Life, Meditation]    
    
There are three ways of living a conscious life, wakeful life. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. In each way you have to 'believe' that others exist equally or more profoundly the way you exist.     
    
**The way of knowing the God**    
You have to believe God exists more profoundly than me. Once your belief is settled strongly in your heart then all other things will be taken care of by God. Now whatever is happening or will happen, that is the wish of God. This is a religious way of living. All religions of the world have this feature. In this way of living, you accept everything as a wish of God.    
    
**The way of knowing the Self**     
Here you have to 'believe' that I exist in a more profound way than I know and experience myself. Therefore, 'who am I' is the primary query and the main focus of living life. This is a spiritual way of life. This is Darshana or crudely saying philosophical way of living. You want to know your true nature.     
    
**The way of knowing the World around**    
Here you have to 'believe' that the physical world, objects and relationships around are more real than any other thing. Now what is the reality of this physical world around? You have two paths. One is to become scientists and know nature and its laws. This way you will know the world objectively. Second way is to go and play in the world without wasting time in understanding the world. This way you will know the world subjectively, from your own perspective, and you reject other's way of thinking and believing. This is a way of becoming a typical political and social person.

In the process of evolution humans acquired the capability of imagination.     
This enables humans to think about the future.     
That is why vision and visionary are most respected by sensible humans.     
With this ability to think you can decide a goal, determine why that goal is important, and work on that goal.     
    
It is not easy to live in the present and forget the future. Human design is not like that.     
You can force or pretend to be present. But that is not possible for any normal mind. Especially for the humans of the 21st century.     
    
What is the bondage?     
Once you have some goal in life and you are not able to achieve that you start naming the bondages, which are holding you back. If you achieve the goal then the output of the goal itself becomes bondage. But, without a goal won't you have bondages? You will become insane if you live in that goalless state of mind for a longer time. Not having a goal and having a goal both can bind you.     
    
What is Moksha?     
Having a goal and not getting swayed away with a goal. Working sincerely and ability to let it go, if that does not yield the results the way you want. Respecting, acknowledging everything but remaining focussed on the task in hand. If the body drops right now during the work there is no worry. If it goes for another hundred years then also not getting lazy. Working like you are breathing, without any struggle or final goal.

# Article5201 : Four Kinds of Powers of a Society     
tags: [Indian Culture ]    
     
Whether you appreciate this or not, ancient Indian wisdom says the following.     
If you are constantly losing intellectual debate, narrative then Brahminhood of your society is in danger.     
If you are constantly losing physical fights with enemies then Kshatruyahood of the society is in danger.     
If you are constantly losing trade to other countries or societies then Vaisyahood of the society is in danger.     
If you are constantly producing substandard skills of your workforce to support your own three pillars and societies then your shoodrahood is in danger.     
     
Extremely unfortunate but true that Brahmin is considered highest and Shudra is considered lowest in today's Indian society. You can change the name but to thrive all four kinds of humans are required in any society.     
     
Think once more where India is losing or weak most of the time today? Skill and Services? Trade? Physical fight? Intellectual debate and Indian Grand Narrative?

# Article5202 : Efforts to Become Happy and Joyful     
tags: [Life ]    
    
We work hard to learn and earn.     
This learning and earning helps us buying comfort in life     
     
We think comfortable things makes us happy     
We forget there is very weak relationship between     
Having comfortable things around and being happy     
     
No matter how much we read and learn     
No matter how we have and earn     
Happiness come from understanding life     
And joy comes from happiness.     
     
Understanding of the world and relationships around.     
Knowledge of how to deal with the circumstances and people around.     
Helps us in becoming joyful.     
     
If you can know and understand your own mind     
Control that better rather than pleasing it all time and giving all what it need     
Then it is like, you stop spoiling an adamant child     
No matter how much we give them     
They always behave in a particular way.     
Mind is like that.     
     
Happiness is a habit of mind.     
You can never make it happy by you eternal efforts of learning and working     
Because all these efforts are in opposite direction of your existence

# Article5203 : About Eligibility     
tags: [ Education ]    
    
Paatra in Sanskrit means pot, but it also means an eligible person. Paatrata means eligibility, capacity, capability to hold what is given to you. You can ask for anything, knowledge, money power. This is part of your imagination. But fortunately if your wish is fulfilled and that knowledge, money or power is given to you then can you hold it gracefully, happily and for the benefits of all around? Asking for the river when you are holding a spoon in your hand is foolishness because the flood can destroy you. But mostly people do not know their own eligibility (Paatrata) and keep weeping for their destiny or giver or God.     
     
     
Perhaps after giving when cosmic intelligence sees people getting destroyed then She restrain Herself from giving. Humans need to increase the size of Paatra where he will hold what he is asking for.     
     
These things we see with children when they ask, please teach me how to make a nuclear reactor but they don't know P of physics. Even if you teach them will they be able to use that knowledge or will they listen properly? You know the answer. Similar things apply to power and money. People think it is the easiest thing to handle but in my experience it is very difficult. See around yourself, how wealthy people spoil relationships, health and peace of mind. And with power they end up in different kinds of trouble for themselves and others.

When a human is living in an uncertain or hostile environment     
he feels helpless about his future.     
In that situation dependency upon an unknown, unseen God is good.     
Sometimes it is better to surrender rather than struggle.    
    
But the tragedy is most of the time humans surrender     
their ability to reason, experiment, and know.    
He just believes in God's wish.    
    
Who created us? Our parents.    
Who are we? The living creature on the earth.    
Are we alone in the universe? We don't know.    
Are we the smartest in the cosmos? We don't know.    
How did the world come into existence? We don't know.    
How electrons, protons, and neutrons were created,     
when they came into existence for the first time? We don't know.    
What is the ultimate cause of our creation? We don't know.    
Is there any absolutely good or bad action in the world? We don't know.    
Do we exist beyond our physical bodily existence? We don't know.    
Gravity created mass or because of mass gravity exists? We don't know.    
Where were we before our birth? We don't know.    
What happens at death? We don't know.    
    
We don't know many things but we are not interested in knowing!    
Because people are busy earning for their survival.    
But what about those who have earned enough to survive?    
Most of them are fearful.     
So, they are busy worshiping or praying or praising God     
in their place of worship or prayer.    
    
Can't they seek the first-hand answer?    
No! Most of humanity has lost that ability     
to ask questions and pursue answers.    
They want a quick answer, the shortest answer.    
    
Humanity never had this kind of tragedy at a mass scale.    
The death of curiosity in most of us.    
We think knowing the answer from a search engine     
or downloading a pdf file on hard-disk means I know the answer.    
    
For our survival, we need certain technical and professional skills.    
Knowing the answer to the business and social world is the easiest.    
Without knowing that we will be begging     
for your two times meal, cloth, and shelter.    
    
But once our survival need is not a big problem    
Then, can we be curious and seek the answer?    
    
Even old people who have enough money to survive     
they are busy in entertainment and watching news channels     
so that I know what is happening around the world. Why?     
Because they don't know there is another     
better way of living life.    
    
Is it easy to learn in old age?    
No, it takes lots of practice and patience     
to tune the mind in different ways.    
    
Even those people who are fully settled and     
have enough money to take care of their needs     
for the next three generations also do not turn inside     
and be curious to ask questions.     
    
Some ask questions but they have learned answers     
from their religious books.     
God knows. God's wish. We are God's slaves etc.    
    
O Pratibimba! Can we make people understand that     
the greatest thing to say while living is saying,     
I don't know and I am searching, I am curious?     
I don't know is the truest statement     
when you don't know anything firsthand.    
    
But, even if you know the answer first hand,     
even then helping others in getting the answer     
from their first hand is a great help     
but giving them your answer is killing their desire to search.

# Article5205 : Brain, Mind, and Manas

The brain is in the head;     
The heart is in the chest;     
Some believe the mind is in the head.     
Some believe the mind is in the heart.     
But beyond your belief     
if you want to experience the mind,     
it is not in your head only     
neither it is in your heart only,     
It is neither within your skin boundary;     
Nor only out of your body;     
the Mind is not physical     
so it is non-local, non-locative.     
     
You can ask people where is your brain,     
But never ask where is your mind,     
No one knows the real     
location of the mind.     
Because it is not located.     
     
Some people think the Mind moves with awareness     
Wherever is your awareness     
that place is your mind.     
This awareness can be     
within the body or outside the body.     
It can be on the flower,     
on the loved one, or on an enemy.     
If you lose your awareness     
like in deep sleep     
then your mind is lost.     
     
Some people think the Indian word 
Manas (मन) is the same as the English word mind.     
A little aware person in the Yogic system     
will say they are different ideas.     
     
In India, we call Manas (मन) and Buddhi (बुद्धि)     
Buddhi is a faculty of reason, roughly as Intellect.     
Manas is faculty to feel,     
it is not in the heart, nor it is in the mind.   




# Article5206 : Mind and Manas
Tags: [Mind, Yoga]

## Two different concepts, Mind is not Manas.

The logical capability of each human brain is different.
Due to this reason when different people see the same event they reason it differently.
Some are able to see the same event mentally and intellectually from 100 directions, some from 10, some from 1 and some even cannot see the event happening before their eyes.

Reasoning is such a wonderful processing ability in humans that it has the ability to bring all the events on the same plane without emotional bias and it allows seeing things as is.

In fact, if the mind is calm, free from emotional swings, free from attachment of mine and yours it can help you become judge and do justice. Without logical ability, the human race cannot even think about justice.

Without reasoning, you cannot generalize concepts correctly and learning is nothing but the process of generalization based on observations. Without reasoning no learning is possible hence no science is possible. Because science is nothing but a generalization of rules based on the patterns which you see in nature.

The beauty of reason is such, if I enter into some different dimension of the event and tell you a unique reason that you normally couldn’t think of, you will accept my point, and ask yourself how did you miss that. Some people will say it is common sense.

So common sense is nothing but logic which is expected to be used by the masses all the time.

Technics like meditation, silent long walks or wandering, sitting long and seeing from the peak of a mountain, on the roof of a high-rise building improve your ability to reason. 

Without reasoning, one cannot live like a human, without proper reasoning which is lesser than common sense society will tag you dumb.

With emotion-free reasoning, you can see things properly.

Therefore cleaning and calming the mind is necessary so that you can see without illusion.

Reasoning has to do with your intellectual ability and not your emotional ability but both are the functions of the brain. In the Indian context, we have Manas and Buddhi, both have different purposes but there is no concept of “mind”. Indian people who have long traditions of Yoga know this very well but when an Indian uses the word “mind” he is confusing himself with this western concept. 

    
# Article5207 : Are You Feeling Stuck in Life?
Tags: [Life]

Life is not a railway track that goes straight. Every life has ups and downs, it has cycles of movement. But it is easy to say when you are at the peak or rising. From my experience, I can say the following will definitely help one in managing the low time of life, especially when you think nothing is moving in life.

1. **Identify what you truly want:** I am stuck, this can be a vague feeling because something in life is not being “right”. When you have these feelings, then you should clarify what you want. What difference do you want? Frame your desires as what you do want to happen. Create a vision board of what you value, and what is the goal.

2. **Change your perspective:** Feeling “stuck” can be because of your mindset. With some self-awareness and conscious effort, you can change your inner voice, and your perspective to be more flexible. Ask how else you can see a situation and how you'll feel about it in the future.

 3. **Move your body:** If you've ever finished the workday with a stiff neck and shoulders, you'll know that tension and stuckness can sit in the body. This is related to the physical body. Exercise, walking in nature, yoga, etc will do wonders for you.

4. **Set a date and park decisions until then:** Procrastination means delaying action and decision. Sometimes you need time to think and become clear in your head. Don’t feel bad that you are procrastinating. Ask yourself how much more time you want to get the clarity and make the decision. During this time keep reflecting and evaluating your options. This exercise will help you commit strongly to the decision you take.

5. **Avoid "analysis paralysis", take a decision:** Once you know what you want, ask yourself, "What's the next smallest step I could take?" It's so easy to get entangled with the stuckness that you forget there are small steps that you could take to make progress.

6. **Tap into your agency:** Stuckness can make you want to wallow in helplessness. Identify an aspect of your life where you do feel in control and then do something about it. Doing anything with choice reminds you of your ability to get unstuck.

7. **Rest, recharge, and focus on self-care:** During a challenging time, keep in mind that you're responsible for your well-being. Do what you need to look after yourself through a good diet, sleep, healthy movement, and connection.

 8. **Identifying yourself with a situation is a problem** Say, "I'm feeling stuck," rather than "I am stuck."  Never identify with the feeling. It's subtle but essential because it allows you to remember that feelings pass. No feelings or emotions are permanent.

9. **Don't beat yourself up:** Many people like to have clarity and control over their lives. 
So the feeling of being stuck can be frustrating. Rather than beat yourself up over feeling stuck, treat yourself with self-compassion.

 10. **Don’t blame others:** We don't live in a vacuum, and others' decisions and actions can impact our lives. But dwelling on them isn't productive. Remember that you're ultimately in charge of many aspects of your personal and professional life.


# Article5208 : The Way of Learning 
Tags: [Education, My Views]
   
If you want to teach your children the process of making tea    
then you don't force them to memorize s for sugar,    
g for ginger, t for tea, w for water, m for milk, b for boil, etc.    
And if they don't memorize you punish them?    
You don't offer them tea?    
You don't allow them to come into the kitchen till they remember the complete vocabulary?    
If this is your way of teaching then it is horrible,    
Children don't need any jail or hell    
You are Yamraj and they are living in hell.    
    
Similarly, how do you teach agriculture to your children?    
Memorize the name of all the seeds, agricultural types of equipment,    
and different types of sand?    
Till the time children do not know s for seed, t for tomato, p for potato, etc,    
you will not take them to a field?    
Then you are nothing but an agriculture teacher and not a farmer?    
    
How do you teach trading to your children?    
Force them to memorize books on trading, pass all the exams,    
Memorize s for sales, p for profit, d for discount, and c for customer?    
Force them to memorize the business concepts?    
If you are doing so then you are an MBA professor, not a Baniya or trader.    
    
How do you teach any foreign language to children?    
Memorize a for apple, b for banana, and c for cat?    
This way, neither you learned English nor your children will learn!    
If you are doing this then you are an English teacher    
who have memorized the dictionary and all the rules of grammar    
but when you have to express yourself or explain some idea then    
you are struggling to do a mental translation.    
    
Unfortunately, our education system where we want to standardize education,    
So that people can choose their careers and    
do whatever they wish to do in their life, is killing lives and creating machines.    
    
Children are asking by doing what I can make more money?    
What should I do so that I become famous?    
What should I do so that I have all the power in my hands,    
so that I can control everything and everybody?    
Not only children, but even so-called mature people are also asking these questions!    
    
All questions like these are nonsensical    
but still, there are people around us who try to give answers to these questions!    
Like you learn Data Science, AI, Acting, Music, Politics,    
Nanotechnology, Bio-Technology, Robotics etc because these are current trends.    
After listening to the advice, children go to universities and learn these things.    
And, how are our universities teaching?    
A for apple, b for bat, c for cat.    
Even after you complete your four or five years degree    
you have not put a single seed in the ground,    
you have not plowed the field    
but you are an agriculture engineer!    
You have not done a single good business deal but you are a Master in Business!    
You have not created a single software that solves your problem    
but you are a Software Engineer!    
You have not created a single machine to solve your problem    
 but you are a mechanical engineer!    
    
If we open our ancient Sanskrit knowledge sources,    
we know hundreds of tools, techniques,    
and processes are discussed in detail to do    
engineering, administration, and business work.    
But how did those people create that huge body of knowledge?    
Not from university research or filing white papers or patents?    
How did those people impart that knowledge, through theoretical lectures?    
    
In ancient times we had the Jaati System and Varna System.    
Because of this system, a child of a farmer will learn farming by going to a farm,    
without going to an agriculture university.    
A child of a goldsmith will learn his ancestor's work from his elders.    
A child of Vaidhya will learn his work from his elders.    
A child of Purohit will learn his work from his elders, etc.    
    
This way parents are the first teacher (Pratham Guru).    
They are respected.    
A family is united.    
Society is cooperative and not in competition with each other.    
Knowledge is practical and not theoretical.    
What people say, they mean it. They don't speak out of the hat.    
So, business commitments are serious and doable.    
There is a center of excellence around every technology.    
    
But today an IAS officer's child wants to become a doctor.    
A Doctor's child wants to become a Mechanical Engineer    
Mechanical Engineer's children want to start a trading business.    
Trader's children want to do agriculture and so on.    
Due to this, there is no knowledge transfer from parents!    
Children up to 14 years are learning a for apple, b for bat,    
memorizing all the history, math, geography, physics, etc.    
After that, they go to Engineering or Medical college to learn the subject    
from teachers and not from professionals!    
    
Now, you decide, what will be the outcome of this entire ecosystem?    
Job dissatisfaction, job instability, virtually no skill,    
Choosing the wrong career but you have to do that work    
because of family responsibilities.    
Stress, madness, restlessness.    
This all can be addressed by giving them all kinds of drugs, smoke, and alcohol.    
One day or two days or two and half days off from the seven days!    
To address that we need pubs, police, NGOs, and political rallies!    
    
This is a crazy ecosystem. Where everyone feels helpless.    
Even those people who have money and other resources feel succumbed to this.    
    
I think a wiser person is one who learns to look inside and work on that path.    
Following society, government, and the words of holy books    
is a sure-shot way of getting mad.    
They are teaching us everything,    
but that which really works.

# Article5211 : Logic of Entangled Mind  
Tags: [Education, My Views]

# Logic of Entangled Mind      
    
Saints, Mahatmas, Rishis of the East Developed a philosophy     
And they told that there are millions of life     
Human life is precious among those lives.    
The best time to come out of this     
unending cycle of birth and death is human life.    
    
They told us human life is especial     
Because human is rational, intellectual    
Human can think, observe, read, contemplate, meditate and     
transcend his physical nature and know himself as Bhraman.    
They can do Sat-Asat vivek,    
They can do Nitya-Anitya vivek.    
    
In fact these sages were telling us     
You have lived millions of life,    
The way you are suffering in this life     
You have suffered millions of time earlier,    
Are you not frustrated yet? Are you not ful yet?     
What other juice you are looking into this sand?    
Wake up, live a meaningful life,    
Think beyound your physical existence     
Know yourself as Chaitanya.    
    
But, the people of east become so lazy     
Forget about working for Moksha or doing Nitya Anitya Vivek,    
We don't have time sense,    
Because there are millions of life.    
We are so bad in time sense that Kabirdas Ji     
need to remind us "Kaal Kare So Aaj Kar"    
    
Western philosopies came later,    
Perhaps their philophers learned from the experience of the East.    
So they told their people     
There is only life,    
By the grace of the God you have become human therefore     
Live such a life that you remain near to that who gave you life.    
    
Those people thought life is only one,    
There are so many interesting things in the life to enjoy,    
Life is sort and we have to experience everything,     
Therefore do everything in this life,    
In this process they became so much materialisic that they don't care about the Soul, Atman, Brahman, God etc.    
    
Oh Pratibimba, the tragedy of the human mind is such     
That is impossible to save human,    
Even if God work hard for human,    
Because all the time human is praying for more material and more entangledment.

# Article5212 : You Can Never Speak The Truth 
Tags: [Philosophy, My Views]

# You Can Never Speak The Truth         
        
Human words, grammar, and speech are tools to hide the truth.    
What really exists, you know and experience    
But, if you say anything about that truth     
then you are hiding some truth.    
    
Truth exists in a certain way.    
It existed even before our languages were developed,     
our civilization has words and grammar to communicate that.    
It exists even today.    
    
When we are telling about this existential truth to some other person.    
We have some intention, we use words    
But in this process no matter how hard we try,    
No matter how efficient or fluent we are in a particular language    
No matter how honest and intelligent we are    
We are telling about the truth.    
We cannot say the complete truth.    
    
If you really want to communicate the truth    
then the best way is to use silence.    
But the problem is most of humanity doesn’t understand this language.    
We don't know any language, that exists without grammar, words, and sounds.    
Therefore when we speak, we speak to hide. we speak untruth.    
    
We can observe three kinds of truth around us,    
Social truths like; The sun rises in the east,     
helping a poor will get the blessing for you, and     
respecting elders will get prosperity and wealth to you, etc.    
    
Cultural truth like Shiva lives in mountains,     
Jesus is the only son of God,     
When you are speaking lie then Saitan is influencing you, etc.    
    
Scientific truth like a proton is heavier than an electron,     
nothing travels faster than light,     
gravity on the earth is 9.8 m/s^2    
    
Pay deep attention to the above all kinds of truth     
and ask yourself, is it really the truth or just a common believe     
that helps all of us, navigating the world around     
but this has nothing to do with existential truth.    
    
If, some nation or culture believes in something     
that doesn't become the truth because of their belief,    
If, entire humanity believes in something     
that doesn't become the truth because of your belief.    
Truth exists, whether you believe it or not     
Whether you say it or not.    
Whether you write or not.    
Truth always exists silently.    
In your words, it gets lost,     
Sometimes sugar-coated other times Neem coated.     
So, saying truth is bitter or saying truth is sweet,    
Saying truth is bright like the sun in the presence of which darkness wash away    
All are your untruth.    
    
O Chaitnya, the Truth is tasteless, it is wordless, colorless    
but part of your experience.     
In fact, your existence is truth without any poem or words.

# Yours Value System and Contradictions    
    
Sanatan Dharma Values and beliefs are     
Every human takes birth because in their previous Life,     
that soul was human but couldn't get Moksha    
Or from previous millions of life evolution you became human first time.    
Whatever you do, whatever you celebrate or enjoy,     
and whatever you achieve while you are living     
the ultimate goal of life is Moksha or Nirvana, or Kaivalya.    
    
If you ask any newly married couple, are you looking for Moksha?    
The answer is negative, they are busy arranging the family, and relationships around.    
If you ask do you want children who will be running for Moksha in Life,     
The answer is negative.    
Then ask yourself what happens to those souls     
who wants to take birth to a newly married couple but wants Moksha?    
    
They will not take birth because there is no support available here.    
In that situation, these souls will think after taking birth     
they can figure out how to manipulate their parents.    
So they come and very soon after some time,     
they become smart to manipulate their parents.    
But not for achieving their goal of Moksha    
But getting sucked more into Samsara    
Parents initially try to help them     
in leading the kind of life they living but     
very soon they realize, neither they got Moksha     
nor is there any hope for their children     
    
Every parent wants Buddha or Vivekananda should not     
take birth from their body but from the other person’s body.    
But your ideals are so high that you want to bow down     
at the feet of those whom you don’t want in your family!    
    
This whole system of Moksha, Rebirth, Karma,     
Respecting Buddhas or Realised ones is superficial.     
In reality, people are confused and in that confusion,     
they push every day of life to another day.    
    
O Chaitnya, what you think?Are parents of the 21st century    
 believe in all these values of the old centuries?     
Are they interested in their Moksha or 
at least in their children’s Moksha?    
Or because of social pressure, they want their children 
become copycats of so-called successful children of their relatives or neighbor

# Article5214 : Continuum of life
Tags: [Philosophy, My Views, Life]   

# Continuum of life    
    
Things around us are not full of life or lifeless.     
These are two opposites.     
This philosophy leads to duality or dichotomy.     
Everything which exists has life. How much life?     
Before that, we need to understand what life is?     
That which takes birth, decay, gets rusted or sick, becomes old, and dies is a life.     
Because it has a lifecycle from birth to death.     
Based on your interaction with things and the world around     
you can consider something less life     
and some as more life     
but that is your subjective understanding     
it has nothing to do with the objectivity of life or life as it exists in the cosmos.     
    
You try to rate the following things based on     
your understanding about the quantity of life in them.     
Put the highest amount of life items on top     
and lower life items below that,     
like you put numbers in decreasing order.     
    
You will be surprised if you meet 100 people 
they all will sort things differently.     
Do not argue or debate or try to prove.      
Do not bring your ethics or religious values in front to sort this list.     
For the time being, avoid adding new items     
or contesting why a particular item is on the list.     
Keeping some categories in mind this list is created.    
    
Space, air, fire, water, earth, medicine,     
plants, bonsai tree, banyan tree, fungi,     
algae, virus, bacteria, sand, mud, stone,     
sesame seed, mango seed, mango,     
cut hair or nails, snake, spider, ant, fly,     
maggots, flour, roti, old roti, rotten roti,    
 dry daal, cooked daal, old stinky daal,     
fish, dead fish, moving plants in ocean,     
insect eater plant, chuimui plant, dead goat,     
goat, goat's baby, cow, cow's baby, human,     
human's baby, spoon, window, floor of flat,     
electricity, magnet, dead body,     
working brain of a dead body, person in a comma,     
sick person, poor person, rich person,     
uneducated person, illiterate person, cultured person,     
scientist, king or politician, enemy, friend, pig flesh,     
cow flesh, goat flesh, fish flesh, human flesh, roasted flesh,     
paneer, milk, curd, ghee, cow dung,     
vegetable oil, petrol, cream, computer, rail,     
rocket, airplane, mobile phone,     
computer model and algorithms like GPT or BERT, robots.    
    
If you are interested in sorting these items     
then you are willing to think about life     
and mystery around.     
    
If not then you believe in a philosophy that do not think so much,     
life is already messy, therefore if we think more     
that will create some more confusion.     
Therefore, eat what you like, and behave the way it suits you     
or what is suitable as per the law, make money,     
enjoy life, thinking doesn't solve any problem,     
in fact when you consume some substance     
and your mind stops working,     
then that is the best thing you want to happen.     
    
This is another way of living,      
living like a bird or cow or tree of a forest.     
They exist and live with little thinking.    
    
O Pratibimba, life in existence is not binary,    
It is in the continuum. 
So you cannot say this is a living being and that is not.    
You can say this is more living and another is less.    
Thus, it does not matter how busy you are and how much you work,    
when you are working like a machine then you lesser life    
When you are fully conscious you are more life.

# The Art Of Missing Life     
    
You take a photograph of a bird,     
data is in your camera and the bird has flown.    
You take a photograph of a river,     
data is in your camera, and the water has gone away.    
You listen to a music performance, music is recorded.     
Data is on the storage device but the musician has gone.    
You smell a breeze coming from a flower,     
you experienced the smell but the flower is far away.    
    
Photographs and recorded music are data,     
it is stored on external devices.    
Photographs, listened words, smell of a flower,     
touch of your loved one is your experience, etc.,     
all is all data, and data is stored in your brain.    
    
People and things exist around you in a certain way. This is the first.    
Your eyes, ears, nose, etc catch the information     
about those and store that data. This is always the second.    
Whatever data is stored in your brain, that data is old data.     
Data is always old, data is always about the past.    
In microseconds, milliseconds things change.     
What is existing before you and     
what you are seeing inside your brain are two different things.     
But the miracle of your existence is such that you think both are the same.    
    
Existence comes first,     
recording devices and data stored in them come later.    
What you have in your mind is nothing     
but data about the world around you.    
It is nothing more than the data stored on a hard disk.    
    
You know the photograph of your loved one,     
which is stored on your computer is not your Loved one.    
You know the photograph of a river     
on your computer is not a real river.    
You know the group photograph of an event     
on your computer is not the event.    
You know the photograph of food items     
on your computer is not real food.    
Whatever you have on your computer or phone is data. It is not reality.    
Reality is that, which is flowing around,     
sometimes around you, sometimes far away from you.    
Sometimes in physical form and sometimes     
it has become vibration and floating around.    
    
With respect to electronics you know     
the difference between data and reality.    
How come with respect to human life     
we are not able to understand     
the difference between data and reality?    
    
Flowers, food, children, rivers, etc are not sitting in our brains.     
We have their data in our brains.    
**The data is never a reality. It is about reality.**    
    
Reality can never be untrue.     
Data even about reality is never true.    
Data about reality can be very close to reality,     
we consider this as true.    
Data about reality can be manipulated or falsely understood,     
so it is far from reality. We consider that as false data.    
But data is never ever a reality of existence around.    
    
Human is so engrossed with electronic data,     
computer data, and phone data that     
they forgot their brain is also having data.    
Humans started giving so much importance to this data     
that they started taking multiple backups of this data.     
They don't want to lose the data.     
They started thinking losing the data means losing reality.    
In business transactions, it may be true.    
    
But the tragedy of life is we started taking our brain data     
so seriously that we don't pay attention to reality.    
This is the reason no one can see reality the way it exists.    
We see reality from the prism of data stored in our hard disk.    
**And this is the art of Missing Life.**    
Human has learned this art over generations.    
Alas! this is the major cause of human suffering.    
    
Except for a few exceptions,     
human of the 21st century is not suffering     
because of food, or war, unlike in earlier centuries.    
Humans are suffering from the data stored     
in their hard-disk. Which they think is the reality.    
**Human is not ready to forget and forgive**     
because they have taken 20 different backups of that data.    
    
O Chaitanya, the only way to come out of your hard-disk (brain) is    
For sometimes come in the present, meditate and experience without thinking.    
Without assigning labels to the people, situations, and things around you.

# Article5216 : The superiority complex of human
Tags: 
**REFINE IT**  
The superiority complex of human

From the human head if you remove the grey cells or neurons then whatever is left to complete body is the animal body.

We give too much importance to this body without realising that it is not any different from any other animal body.

This sense of superiority among all living being and not only that since your sense of security among all human being I am the best or I should be the best that I should be the winner or I should be the first or I should be on the top is the human madness. This sense of superiority come to human just because of one part called brain.

This sense of security is so much that human think god created this world for human. We are here to enjoy and rul other species. Not only that we are here to enjoy over other suffering and others labour and hard work. God has meet me intelligent God has made me king God has made me human being there for I should be special and I must use this opportunity to enjoy the life and be better than other species and other human being.

Unfortunately if this sense of security is taken away from human being or he feel I am worthless or I am being exploited then human can't live. 

Architectural design of the software in human brain its such that extremely few people can live by knowing the reality that we are nothing here in this existence. Our body is nothing more than the animal body. Creation is not human centric. The creator is not like human being. The creator does not have emotions like human. The creator does not understand the 8000 languages which human created in last 20 or 30000 years. But, there is a creation. How it happened. We don't know. Who did it we don't know. Because of our stupidity complex we can't handle this ignorance there for we try to give the answer the answer which are coming from books or fairy tale stories.

Human think that he thinks but unfortunately he is repeating the same thoughts which culture or society has given him. Society and culture was built over thousands of year. Therefore it has its own wisdom. But inheriting everything from the society and culture,  politicians and religious leaders, artist and scientist, elders and experts and not using your own brain means we are not more than an animal body.

# Article5217 : Smartness is foolishness
Tags:   
**REFINE IT**
Smartness is foolishness

Ability to think and imagine is an incredible ability of human race

We are able to think and evasion about the abstract concepts non existing objects

Imagining with the help of existing data extrapolating and predicting is great ability. But ability to imagine and think in the absence of data is much greater ability.

This is why human is intelligent race smart race among all the lives exist on this planet.

But unfortunate thing is when we imagine about something about which data source is already before you. We don't talk to the people and we imagine about them. And then think our imagination our prediction or forecast about them was correct.

This act mein Vishva table for intelligence agencies security agencies because they need to protect the society nation therefore they need to think about enemy of the country enemy of the society.

Unfortunately we use disability even with our close friends relatives independence. Without asking about them we imagine. After asking if our designation is not fitting to the fact we argue with them. This is how relationship get spoiled. We think we are smart we could prempt and think in advance but most of the time in relationship it turns a foolish idea.

Now you decide in your life you want to be proved as smart and then loose relation and finally look foolish.

Or look innocent keep relation and remain wise. This all depends relationship with whom. Relationship with wise will never go away no matter what you do relationship with fool is worth going no matter how could you do for them the remain unhappy.


# Article5218 : The Real Hell of False Ego
Tags: [My Views, Life, Society]

# The Real Hell of False Ego

As a life, you can have the following feelings about yourself 
and each of these serves some purpose 
for yourself and the society around you 
and causes some harm to you.

1- In this infinite cosmos, among billions of galaxies, 
trillions of stars and planets, 
my planet and my life is too insignificant.

2- In this cosmos my planet is special, 
Because it inhabits life in the whole known cosmos, 
but I am insignificant among trillions of life on this planet.

3- On this planet, there are several kinds of lives 
but human is a special kind of life 
because of our ability to think, reason, imagine, and empathize.
I am human therefore I am special.

4- On this planet my culture is great 
because mine is the older, grandest, wisest. 
But I am insignificant, 
because I have not learned anything 
from my ancestors and the wisdom of my culture.

5- My culture is great and I am the torch wearer of this culture, 
I am a special person from this culture, 
I am a guru, a leader, and elder people of my culture 
my people should respect and worship me for 
my knowledge and my sacrifices.

6- My culture is great and other cultures lesser great 
therefore their people should also respect 
my culture and leaders of my culture.

7- My culture is greatest and I am the leader therefore 
all the people of this planet should respect me 
and pay taxes as long as they are living on my land. 

When we say our ancestor then 
we are willing to go back two or three thousand years back. 
But, if we go back to the origin of life 
we will find our ancestors are Algae and fungi 
and their ancestor is oxygen and the sun.

As individual human beings, we are nothing here. 
As a group of humans, we have tremendous power 
which other animals do not have. 
As a group, we are a very creative species. 
As an individual, we cannot even create simple alpin. 

So culture, religions, societies, villages, nations, etc 
are natural and useful creations of humans. 
These are not creations of God.
Their diversity of thoughts, cultures, beliefs, 
and the way of thinking 
that is why we could create so much that we have today. 

In ancient times whether Indian or Greek or Mayan civilizations 
could do wonder because of allowing this diversity within their culture. 

In today's time whatever advancement 
in science and technology has happened 
it is because those nations 
who were having wealth 
and allowed different thoughts to melt on 
their land to create something unique.

In the process of evolution, every race 
developed some unique mental and physical capabilities. 
It makes sense to come together to create 
something more meaningful for all humans. 
As far as other lives are concerned, 
humans need not do anything 
except don't disturb them or at least disturb them. 

Animals and trees in the forest are smart enough 
to take care of themselves 
they don't need human help. 
But if humans need their help then 
we need to reciprocate that help to them.

Thinking my race is the greatest, 
my language is the greatest is good for an individual 
because it gives him or her the purpose to fight and live. 
This helps you refine and improve yourself and your culture. 

But entering in the war and killing people, 
entering into social media space, and abusing and hurting people 
to ensure that only my race and my culture should survive on this planet. 
That would be dangerous for this planet and humanity.
Because without diversity there is 
no growth, refinement, or evolution possible. 

Our belief systems whether we consider this history or not, are great. 
They have brought us where are today. 
It helps us in experiencing something unique and evolving. 
But when we want to have only one belief system, 
This monotony is dangerous for the human race.
Because we get quickly bored.

In public meetings, public platform 
before becoming aggressive and attacking others 
we should ask ourselves,
Are we looking for monotony or diversity?
A little bit of bad, a little bit of cancer, 
and a little of rough weather make the human body and mind strong.
Because the body keeps fighting and the immune system remains active.
Too much makes us sick and we fall ill.
But how much is too much you need to decide.
