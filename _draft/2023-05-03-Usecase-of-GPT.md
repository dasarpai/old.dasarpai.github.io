# Application of GPT 

## Morgan Stanley
- A leader in wealth management, Morgan Stanley maintains a content library with hundreds of thousands of pages of knowledge and insights spanning investment strategies, market research and commentary, and analyst insights. This vast amount of information is housed across many internal sites, largely in PDF form, requiring advisors to scan through a great deal of information to find answers to specific questions. Such searches can be time-consuming and cumbersome. 
- harness its intellectual capital with GPT’s embeddings and retrieval capabilities
- The company was founded almost 100 years ago and publishes thousands of papers annually covering insights on capital markets, asset classes, industry analysis, and economic regions around the globe. 
-  trained GPT-4 to make the internal chatbot
 
## Be-my-eyes 
- image-to-text object recognition tool 
- blind and low vision community will utilize these tools not only for a host of visual interpretation needs, but also to have a greater degree of independence in their lives
- GPT-4 technology not only recognizes and names what’s in there in refrigirater, but extrapolates and analyzes what you can make with those ingredients.
- a user was able to navigate the railway system—arguably an impossible task for the sighted as well—not only getting details about where they were located on a map, but point-by-point instructions on how to safely reach where they wanted to go.
- Yet traversing the complicated physical world is only half the story. Understanding what’s on a screen can be twice as arduous for a person who isn’t sighted. Screen readers, embedded in most modern operating systems, read through the pieces of a web page or desktop application line by line, section by section, speaking each word

## Stripe 
- asked 100 employees to do something highly unusual: stop their day jobs and instead, dream up features and functionality for the payment platform using the newest generation of OpenAI’s language learning model, GPT-4
-  Engineers from teams spanning support, onboarding, risk, and docs considered where Stripe could use artificial intelligence that understands free-form text and images and builds human-like responses
- Stripe tries to understand exactly how each business uses the platform and customizes support accordingly.
- Many businesses, such as nightclubs, keep their websites sparse and mysterious so it can take a great deal of searching and clicking to understand what’s going on. Now, Stripe uses GPT-4 to scan these sites and deliver a summary, which outperforms those written by people.

## Khanacademy
 - AI-powered assistant that functions as both a virtual tutor for students and a classroom assistant for teachers.
 - To think about questions like, ‘Why did you answer that way? Why do you think that's true? What would happen if—?
 
 ## Duolingo - Teaching Different language
 - Yabble equips its users with vital customer insights to inform their business strategy.
 - actionable insights—whether they help identify a new product to launch, upgrade existing services, or understand what customers are loving (or not loving) about a product.
 - difficult culling and analyzing vast amounts of customer feedback can be in order to gain the insights needed to inform business strategy.
 
 ## Inworld AI
 - Inworld is making this next generation of characters more engaging.
 - Inworld was able to build out differentiated aspects of characters’ personalities including emotions, memory, and behaviors.
 
 - the rich characters who players befriend or battle are only as complex as the scripts created for them.
 - Using Inworld, creators can bring a non-playable character to life in minutes, commonly known as a NPC, using natural language to describe the character’s personality. They can also tailor elements of cognition and behavior, including the character’s goals, motivations, manners of speech, memories, and even voice.
 
 
 ## Government of Iceland
 - Icelanders cherish their language for its rich cultural heritage and connection to the nation’s identity.
 - The country’s government maintains a Language Planning Department that coins Icelandic terms for new ideas, rather than adopting so-called “loanwords” from other languages. A computer, for instance, is a tölva (“number prophetess”). Through these efforts, the language preserves its distinctive character and remains closely connected to its Old Norse roots.
 
 - In a process called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback, or RLHF, human testers give GPT-4 a prompt, and four possible completions are generated. 
 - Testers then select the best answer from the four responses and edit it to create an ideal completion. The data from this process is then used to further train GPT-4 to produce better responses in the future.
 - Prior to RLHF, the process of fine-tuning a model was labor and data-intensive. Þorsteinsson’s team attempted to fine-tune a GPT-3 model with 300,000 Icelandic language examples, but the results were disappointing.
 
 ## Waymark 
 - Waymark was perfecting their easy-to-use video creation platform. GPT-3 helped them consistently produce stronger, more relevant scripts.
 - Waymark has established itself as the leading platform to create TV commercials and digital video ads—one of the most powerful ways for businesses to introduce their products, services, and events. 
 - With an extensive library of professionally-produced templates that anyone can edit, regardless of technical background, Waymark reduces the barriers that prevent so many would-be advertisers from launching successful video campaigns.
 - Waymark made video creation accessible and easy for anyone, their product research showed that two out of three people still struggled with what to say in those videos. 
 - Their copywriters had created industry-based video scripts for top industries, but they often proved too vague and required a lot of customer input. Waymark started to solve this problem with a proprietary script-writing feature, but the results were still too generic for many businesses. As Waymark’s business grew and their customer base diversified, the challenge only grew more complex.
 - Our power users were spending too much time editing scripts, and other users would simply give up altogether.
