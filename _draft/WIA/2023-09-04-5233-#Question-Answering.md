We get incomplete answer or in correct answer because we do not ask correct question our questions are not complete therefore answers are also not complete and correct.

Our questions are not complete or correct or appropriate because we do not know the full context or we are unable to comprehend the problem for which we are asking question

We do not know full context or unable to comprehend the problem because we are in hurry to solve the problem or there is another problem and we want to solve that problem in our mind is there or we are not interested in solving the problem but we want to do something else that is more enjoyable than this problem solving
