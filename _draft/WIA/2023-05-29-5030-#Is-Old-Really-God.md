# Is old really Gold?



An important function of the human brain is called Memory. 
Humans should use this for lesson learning. But unfortunately it is used to create nostalgic moments in the present life. People love it. Why? Because they don't want to face the present and fearful about the future so the only place to draw pleasure is to live in the past.

As per my experience this is disease of the human mind. Music, recording, movies, albums etc inflame this disease. But people don't want a solution, they love exaggerating their pain/pleasure and their past.

If we ask millennium child his/her nostalgia is different. People of every age have different degrees, different types and different severities of this disease. 

Living on the breath, watching the present and remaining mindful is the only solution. ðŸ˜€
