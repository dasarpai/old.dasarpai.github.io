What is the Truth

Your son fails in 12th class exam or you get promoted in your job. One brings suffering and another brings happiness.

Some believe happiness are because of my karma, suffering is because of God. Because God is testing me. On top of that some believe God tests only few strong, reliable.

Some believe happiness is because of God's grace, suffering is because of my Karma.

Some believe happiness and suffering both are because of my karma.

Some believe happiness and suffering both because of God's wish. He wants us to bring closer to Him and for that he wants we should get results of our Karma, get exhausted and reach to him.

Some believe happiness and suffering is neither because of God nor because of Karma. Because they don't exist. It is your own mental imagination you can impose happy happiness or suffering on any event. It has nothing to do with reality but pure mental phenomenon.

Religious books say all kinds of things. People say all kind of things. What is reality?

Knower is silent and speaker is speaking his or her believe all over the city, he/she doesn't know the reality.

Perhaps calm, silent, introvert, meditative mind knows the truth but she/he will not speak till you don't have ability to experience what is being said. But the moment you have that ability you don't feel to listen and speak with world. You are full in yourself. You know the truth.
