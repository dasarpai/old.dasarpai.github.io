Statistics

A table or data set has many columns

A table or data set can contain the data about sample or population

Is column of a table has some distribution of the data. The distribution depends upon the type of data like numerical categorical, and what can kind of column is that like gender city is etc

Statistics defines the summary of table in terms of mean, mode, median standard deviation range min max etc. But all this summary is for sample data

Parameters means we are talking about statistics or mean mode median standard deviation minimum maximum etc of the population data set

When census data set is not available before us we do not know anything about the population so there is no parameter

But using the sample data if we can know about the population and this subject is called infrential statistics

Non parametric means where parameter is not known. It means we do not know about the population in another word we can say we do not know about the mean mode median etc of the column or variable

We do not know means we don't have data to calculate. Does not mean we have not done calculation of the data before us.

Statistical tests are done to check
 1. whether this data i.e. column it's same as another data. it means we have 2 samples and we want to know whether they are part of the same population or not. You can achieve this bhai comparing the variance of to columns or data full stop the second way of knowing this is to compare the statistics of the sample with the population


Data is a very very confusing term used by statisticians. It is used for various things for example of column is data, summary of the column is data, a cell value in a column is data, when you are referring all these things about the sample it is data and when you are referring all these things in the context of population that is data.
