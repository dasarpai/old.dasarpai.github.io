# The Meaning of Success  

Every parent wants his children to be successful.   
Every citizen wants his state or country to be prosperous.   
Every teacher wants his students to become successful.   
There is industry around the success,   
Leaders from this industry teach newcomers to become successful.   
Authors are writing books to make people successful.   
People read these books to become successful.   
Many of them don't want to take any pain to become successful.   
And others want to walk any length to become successful.   
   
   
Inspiring success in children's mind or adolescent mind is easy   
Because they want to enjoy the life, have adventure in the life   
Have lots of money to buy anything on this planet.   
Because that is the meaning of success for them.   
But when matured people define the success this way   
Then it is sign of immaturity,   
It means you have not grown enough   
or seen enough from a crushing process called life.   
   
   
No matter how much wealth, fame, money, status, happiness,   
pleasure, buying power you attach to yourself, you will never feel enough.   
You will not find a single person of past and present   
who fit your definition of success.   
This takes you into further ignorance,   
That I am unique, nobody in past happened like me,   
I will live my life in unique way   
All this is fine, till you start feeling   
You will do that and achieve that in your life which nobody did in the past.   
   
   
You want to work hard, or sleep on a stone in the forest. That is your choice.   
You want to make lots of money, or give away all your wealth. That is your choice.   
You want to have a healthy body, or have enough money    
to buy any kind of health treatment. That is your choice.   
   
   
But you want to become successful    
without knowing what is the meaning of success   
Or keep changing that definition of success    
on the dawn of every new year's goal setting.   
That is the path of anything but success.   
   
   
For refreshing your memory I am giving list of a few people and organization   
Some of these are no more, some still exist around us.   
Read it and ask yourself what is the meaning of success in life?   
Until we die, anything can happen to living life or living organization.   
   
For a few minutes look below a small list and think, 
Who created these multi billion dollar global organizations?    
How long they were successful? How many years they remain in the business?    
And how long owners and employee experienced the success?
