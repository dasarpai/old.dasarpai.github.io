# Is Dying Painful?



None of living have an experience of Dying.
But those who are living have seen people dying before them 
We, living people, see lots of suffering around us 
People are suffering due to 
various physical and mental health reasons.
For them living is painful.
To make the life joyful they try methods.
Some to bring temporary relief,
Some to bring little long term relief.
But there is no permanent solution of the suffering.

When people have pain and suffering 
Then some of them go through that alone.
Some of the sufferer wants others to suffer with them.
But sometimes healthy people suffer because 
loved one is suffering and having pain.

Dying is very painful for most of the people.
We want to live healthy and never ready to die.

Even if you live 1000 years of life 
what will you do here on this planet 
with old body, old memories, 
thousands of relatives friends and enemies? 

When you are youth you want to be super busy. 
You have same routine, make lots of money. 
After you retire you have lots of money 
same borring routine. 

To break the routine and boredom 
you go to picnic or foreign tour. 
If you have 1000 years life 
you will repeat same thing.

Advancement in the Health system, 
ecosystem around insurance companies 
and society doesn't allow a sick person to die. 
In the name of service to elders, 
poor (Daridra Narayan), weak (Nirbal ke Bal Ram), 
and to God fear 
people feel bad when they need to let person die.
