# Who Is Athiest
    
Completely unaware and ignorant of the competition     
of the various religions, gods and their followers     
I was resting on the lap of the Truth     
The Truth was protector so I never bothered to take risk     
of waking and then running in the world for doing some karma     
Because I know I am a child,     
I will make mistake and follower will torture me     
What else can be a more protected place     
to live than the lap of the Truth?    
    
It must be dawn in the sky     
and David, my close friend came to meet me     
He told me that if you don’t believe Jesus as the son of God     
As your savior then there is no hope for you.     
It looks you are an atheist and you are going to go into eternal hell.    
    
I told him I don’t know who is god,     
Nor am I aware where he lives,     
Neither I have seen the birth of Jesus     
How can my belief in something     
for which I am completely unaware,     
someone can push me to eternal suffering?     
Humanity is already suffering     
not because of belief or not belief in Jesus.    
    
I heard about Jesus,     
He had good saintly qualities     
He walked on this earth     
Did many good karmas for humanity,     
so I have very high regard and respect for his work.    
    
But, truly I have not seen God.     
Why are forcing me to believe that,     
that saint was the son of the God     
A God whom I don’t know     
You want me to believe in God     
And then believe further that Jesus was his “the” son?     
If God exists then why am I not his son?     
My friend got upset and left me alone in his hopelessness    
    
Once upon a time, I was walking in the garden of the Truth     
My friend Salim saw me puzzled and came inside the garden     
He wanted to help me     
He asked me, what happened,     
why are you looking so puzzled?     
I told him the story of my friend David.    
    
Salim told me in a compassionate voice that forget him.     
You need not worry about those people.     
Those are false people, they are killers of Jesus.     
But I have good news for you.    
    
“The” latest version of the message of the God     
was given to Prophet Mohammad     
It is written in a book, which I can give you.     
If you understand that book and live life as per that book     
then you will go to heaven     
Otherwise, this world is controlled by the Saitan     
And you will definitely go to eternal hell    
    
I told him this world is already suffering.     
But not because people have not read your book     
There are many who have read that     
People have understood that book thoroughly     
And trying their best to do as per the book.     
That doing is causing a problem to humanity     
Not the book reading or understanding    
    
After understanding that book     
Why don’t you yourself do something     
To make this earth a beautiful place for all human     
But don’t force me to read something more     
And then do something,     
And in exchange for that     
your book will promise me some unknown beautiful land.    
    
I asked Salim, how reading a book make sure that I can follow the book?     
Information, knowledge, wisdom, and enlightenment all are not the same.     
During this conversation, we both are in the Garden of the Truth.     
Why we need to believe something     
which is not in our experience and beyond our comprehension?     
If you have patience then talk to me logically and from experience.    
    
Why my belief is going to determine eternal hell or heaven for me?     
As if my karma not enough.     
Have I done any harm to Jesus or David or his God?     
Have I hurt you, your book, your prophet, or your Allah?     
Then why and who can illogical punish me?     
This cosmos is not so dumb and idiot to punish an innocent.    
    
He tried to convince me but failed and finally told me that     
Although you are a good man     
But you are Kafir and I feel pity for you that     
A good person like you will definitely go into eternal hell.    
    
Now I was very much puzzled     
My two friends who think so much about me     
They want to ensure that I should go to eternal heaven     
but I am not complying with their belief systems and their books     
Nor I am interested in dying for the sake of heaven     
Therefore they are feeling helpless for me.    
    
Yes, I am an Atheist     
Till my senses and intellect is working     
I cannot allow dogmas &amp; believes to subjugate them     
I live on the lap of Truth     
I want to see the Truth and realize the Truth.    
    
Yes, I do not know many things     
But I am ready to understand.     
If someone explains me logically     
I am ready to put my best efforts     
to understand the Truth of life     
I am not interested in your concept of     
one time death &amp; going to eternal heaven or hell    
    
I know after I die I will leave this body here     
Because this body is my loan from the mother earth     
Without body, heaven and hell is of no value for me     
I don’t care about your food, virgins, and wine there.     
Those interests I could never develop even in this life.    
    
As far as heaven and hell for my soul is concerned     
I know I am eternal I will never die     
I will come again, as per my Karma     
I will come again, like a leaf come again     
to the tree after falling at the feet of the tree     
I may not know that I am the same     
but this tree may be knowing.     
But I am not concerned about that also     
As long as I don’t know my true nature,     
No one can help me,     
books are external.     
After I know myself, I don’t need any help from anyone.    
    
Yes, I don’t believe in Shiva sitting on the mount Kailasha with his family.     
Yes, I don’t believe Vishnu sleeping in the ocean and Lakshmi sitting pressing his feet.     
Yes, I don’t believe Brahma an old white beard god is hanging in the sky because his job is over.    
    
If your definition of Theist is to believe     
in some book and your imaginative stories of hell and heaven,     
in your loving, caring, and cruel God,     
in your stories of god created the world in seven days and then taking rest.     
Then I don’t have shame in saying that     
I have not surrendered my intellect &amp; intelligence.     
It is not going in my head.    
    
But “my friend”, Truth, knows I am a theist.     
I believe in the Existence of life because I can experience this.     
I believe in the Law of karma because I can rationalize this.     
I believe in Dharma because it binds me to my duties.     
I believe in the Mother because her love guides me and protects me while living.     
I believe in the Guru because his guidance shows me the right path in life.     
I believe in the Friends because their presence makes me feel that I exist and I am valuable to them.     
I believe in Death because I have seen many passing before me.     
I believe in the Wisdom of ancient books because they do not disconnect me from the reality of the world.    
    
The truth of Vedanta is Life for those     
Who do not care for hell and heaven.     
Who do not care about God and Saitan.     
Who do not care about the rise and fall in life.    
    
Only those who are bold can see in the Eyes of Truth directly.     
Very few are blessed who have an opportunity to walk with the Truth     
This comes at a price.     
The price is you have to drop your dogmas and believes.     
The habit of saying untruth and pleasing people     
The habit of remaining slept for the whole lifetime.     
The habit of pretending you know when you don’t know.     
And cowardliness of not living the truth which you know.    
    
Yes I am atheist as per your worldly definitions     
But I know, I am the child of Truth     
And Truth is never Atheist    
    
What did you say?     
Because I am theist therefore I deserve a place in heaven?     
O man I am already in heaven     
you around me polluting this heaven     
So please go to earth where believer lives.    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Your Truly Hari
