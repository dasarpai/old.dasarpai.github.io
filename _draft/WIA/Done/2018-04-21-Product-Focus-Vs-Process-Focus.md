# Product Focus Vs Process Focus    
## Jugaad vs Karmanye Vadhikaraste    
       
Teaching philosophy is one thing living is another.    
    
“Karmanye Vadhikaraste”.     
Means you have control over karma, your process.     
So guide and control the process.    
    
“Adhikaraste MaFaleshu Kadachna”.     
Doesn’t mean without expecting a result.     
Nor does it mean result for someone else     
or work for society or higher cause etc.    
    
It simply means the output of the process     
cannot be controlled directly.     
So don’t waste your time     
sitting at the other end of the process tunnel     
and expect results as per your wish.     
Do whatever you can do at the process part,     
if the process is rightly designed     
keeping output in the mind     
then the output of the process     
will ultimately happen the way the process designed.    
    
This simple philosophy is     
told thousands of years back in the war field.     
We teach it every day.     
But only the Japanese could live this in the true sense.    
    
We Indian preach this     
but we bypass all processes and want the best results.     
Years over years people are talking     
debating discussing, preaching     
but where do you find the sign of implementation?    
    
There is another philosophy of getting things done, Jugaad.     
The Jugaad concept says work should get done by any means.     
“Karmane” concept leads you to perfection in the process.    
    
In the “Karmane” concept, if a good product is the output of a bad process.     
then you give away that product     
because luck produced that     
and it belongs to anybody but to me.    
    
If you start accumulating things given by luck     
then you also need to cry on things     
thrown upon you by bad luck.     
So better avoid or give away the fruits of luck.    
    
Jugaad concept wants results in the short run.     
The Karmane concept focuses on life long work.     
Neither present can be ignored nor future.     
If too much Jugaad in life then very soon     
when the future becomes present you will have many problems.
