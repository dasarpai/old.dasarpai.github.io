# Suffering And Remedy
    
If you know the cause of all your pain and suffering     
is ignorance of the subject from you are suffering     
then yoga of Gyana is for you.     
This can lead you to happiness.    
    
If you think the cause of suffering is your laziness     
then Karma is the solution     
otherwise more Karma will bring     
more pain and suffering to you.    
    
If you think the cause of suffering     
is Shraddha, faith, devotion then Bhakti is the solution     
otherwise, with Bhakti you can suffer as well.    
    
If you think the cause of suffering is body pain     
then Hatha Yoga is the solution     
otherwise, Hatha Yoga will suck your time     
and you still remain miserable.    
    
If you think the cause of your suffering is flickering mind     
then meditation is the solution     
else more meditation can make you tired.    
    
The mute point is this,     
everything is not for everyone     
Know the cause of suffering     
and adopt the solution as per the problem.    
    
Is there any life in the world     
which is not suffering from at least one of these?    
    
O Pratibimba, can a suffering mind     
clearly, know the real cause of suffering?    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Yours Truly Hari
