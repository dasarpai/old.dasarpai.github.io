# Dream Body and Physical Action 

Dream Body and Physical Action 

While sleeping in your bedroom,
You had a dream that you were traveling.
In this situation, if your body strongly feels the need to urinate, 
you go to the restroom, urinate, return to your seat,
and yet, still feel the same discomfort in your stomach as before urinating.
It means, your dream body went to restroom
while the actual urge was coming from the phyical body.

Your body and mind are trained.
It doesn't cooperate in reality, 
this helps avoiding a mess, as you might in childhood.

In childhood or with a weaker body, all this doesn't work.
In childhood, this occurs because 
the mental and physical bodies aren't trained.
Children don't distinguish between reality and dreams,
acting as if dream actions are in the real world.

In old age or severe illness, this occurs
because your body is too weak 
to interact with others or manage itself,
yet you're aware of what's happening, unavoidable happens.

Human has many desires, 
wishes which he want to fulfill before he dies. 
To fulfill those he runs throughout his life. 

By accident or by chance or by too much travel and exertion 
or some Guru's timely training when a person realise 
that this world is dream 
then their physical and mental body coordination happens properly 
and they don't do all the things all the time at all places 
and they avoid creating a mess. 

Their waken consciousness 
They don't co-operate with neither their physical body 
nor with their mental/dream body. 

If there is too much pain of not fullfilling some desire 
they do some act like dreaming people.
Dream people turn another side 
while sleeping and manage their bladder pressure 
but they never urinate in the body. 

You can manage this for sometime 
but one day you have to wake up. 
Otherwise other people around you will suffer too much around you because of your act. 

Of course, people around suffer in their dream 
because in their dream you and your actions are real for them.

It is impossible to wake the entire humanity at once. 
We are like any other animal on this planet 
just by reading books, having society and economy 
we do not get the realisation 
that this is advance level of dream.

Like I am writing this message in dream 
and you will reading this in your dream. 

Technology developed to communicate these messages developed in dream and 
we are using the technology in dream. 
Technology development was possible because 
some smart people observed this dream world so well 
they found some tricks to manage the so called physical objects around.

In reality physicality is our own creation in a field called space time. 
Consciousness is fundamental form which time space is projected. 
All the things around have some reality in space time 
but not that we understand with our untrained dreamy mind. 

It is not that we haven't been trained. 
We have been trained a lot and know a lot but 
only about another kind of dream world called physicality is reality.
