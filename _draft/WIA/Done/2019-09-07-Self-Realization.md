# Self Realization   
       
What is the meaning of Self-Realization?     
What is the meaning of Liberation?     
What is the meaning of Self-Actualization?     
What is the meaning of God-Realization?     
What is the meaning of Moksha?     
What is the meaning of Becoming one with God?    
    
Whatever I do physically, mentally, or verbally     
If I have known and convinced myself fully that     
I have a body, I am not a body.     
I have a mind, I am not a mind.     
I have some memories, I am not memories.     
I have objects, people, and relations around     
but I am neither of these.     
Then I am on the path of Moksha.    
    
If I have convinced myself that     
the world which I enjoy, suffer,     
watch, observe, cry, and laugh at is my world.     
Knowing all the subtle shackles around me     
are my conscious or unconscious creation.     
And I am the creator, Brahma, of this world and     
no one created this world me but me only     
Then I am on the path of Moksha.    
    
If I have convinced myself that     
In my whole life till now     
I have seen the world around     
But I have not seen my real eyes     
What I saw is a reflection of my eyes,     
And even after that, I say I have eyes!     
Then I don’t believe in having eyes.    
    
Their presence gives me the experience of     
color, shape, and different size around.     
When experience exists then why should I believe?     
This realization is uplifting me from believing     
and taking me towards experiencing.     
Now I am on the path of Moksha.    
    
If I have convinced myself that     
whatever Brahma has created     
Can be destroyed by Shiva,     
no matter how ugly or dear is that.     
Therefore the world around me     
which is causing me suffering     
I can destroy this world by opening     
my third eye and becoming Shiva.     
No “Shiva” will destroy the real world around me.     
But I as Shiva will destroy my own suffering     
I can break all the barriers, walls and     
boundaries of the jail     
in which I have arrested my own existence.     
Now I am on the path of Moksha.    
    
Iswara Prapti means I know and experience that     
Ishwara was never lost.     
I was lost, and now I am back home.     
There is nothing to receive (Prapti)     
except to live in my own existence     
and not in the mental Imagination     
Of my own or created from     
those entertaining stories.    
    
There is nothing in getting Moksha     
except knowing and experiencing that     
there is no shackle there is no bondage.    
    
Apart from this experience of your own     
Whatever you heard from     
those stories of your religion     
are good for entertaining a restless mind.     
They can temporary solace you     
but that is not the final solution     
of your eternal bondage and suffering.    
    
O Chaitnya, Know thyself as free,     
You are like an elephant     
which is tied to a small plant     
with a small thin rope and     
you think there is bondage!    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Yours Truly Hari    
    
Until Next Time Stay Blessed
