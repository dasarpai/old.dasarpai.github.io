## Boundaryless In Boundary

    
O wise one you know your limitations,     
You know your helplessness,     
You know your boundary,     
You know you have a desire     
To live in boundless space     
and in a timeless time     
A desire to expand your Relationship,     
business and influence Infinitely     
A desire to live and enjoy     
present and future without dropping     
your past good moments.    
    
Service to humanity, service to animals,     
Service to your religion, a life of morality     
All are your chosen way to live     
You chose those because of fear or     
out of compassion or that is the     
the only wise way to live?    
    
You say the human race is most wise     
Tell me which race other than human     
Seeks infinite thoughts the finite mean     
Want to enjoy eternally and infinitely!     
Even after knowing that     
there were time and space     
when and where you didn’t exist     
in that boundary, you live today!    
    
This boundary of your skin     
Is your created, nurtured, and maintained.     
What has been created and maintained     
Will be destroyed one day     
To understand this fact     
Do you need any help from books and other people?    
    
With time walls and boundaries     
become faint and weak     
No matter how much you maintain them     
Yoga and exercise is not to live long     
Because no one knows when you have     
to vacate house and boundary will fall     
Yoga and exercise is to live fully     
In the time, when you live in Boundary.    
    
If through some trick or grace     
Some wisdom dawn in your boundary     
of existence then that this is truly like this.     
This is me and this is not me.    
    
If you are able to clearly mark your boundary     
Of physical, mental, and emotional existence     
Then there is hope for you to     
Break the boundary at your own will.    
    
Once bounded know truly     
from the experience that I am boundless     
Then there is no cry and fear in you     
To live longer in a body,     
To work hard and earn most to maintain the boundary     
To be moral because of fear     
of law, society, god, or karma    
    
Because the way of wise is     
To live and let others live,     
Help bounded to break the boundary     
by bounded’s own efforts and wisdom     
No other human or god or messiah     
should remove my boundary without my wish    
    
The only lord of death has that right     
Only with time and suffering     
And association with mindful people     
can help me in knowing     
my true boundary and my boundlessness.    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Yours Truly Hari
