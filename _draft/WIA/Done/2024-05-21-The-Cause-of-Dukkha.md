# The Cause of Dukkha   
 
The mind's work is to think, recall, and dream,  
To feel emotions like a flowing stream.  
It swings us from joy to sadness so deep,  
In its restless search for pleasure to keep.

The mind never seeks the path of pain,  
Always chasing after pleasure's gain.  
But it doesn't know where joy will be found,  
So it runs in circles, round and round.

From places, people, and moments bright,  
It hopes for happiness, pure delight.  
But the mind is built to wander and sway,  
So complaining won't change its way.

Yet when after all the running and chase,  
The mind still finds sorrow in its place,  
The fault lies not with the mind's desire,  
But with the intellect, that guiding fire.

If the intellect can't see what's true,  
Confused and lost, without a clue,  
It won't guide our senses or actions right,  
Leading us deeper into the night.

But sometimes, old habits steer our mind,  
Seeking things that keep us blind.  
If intellect shines with wisdom clear,  
And willpower strong keeps us near,  
We can avoid much of life's cruel sting,  
Though some pain will linger, a stubborn thing.

For as long as we see the world as two,  
Me and you, in separate view,  
There will be struggle, a lasting strife,  
But wisdom can lighten the load of life.

So let the mind dance, let it run its course,  
With the intellect guiding, a steady force.  
In the harmony of mind and heart,  
We find the balance, the healing art.
