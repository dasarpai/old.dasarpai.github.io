## Dissolving A Drop In The Ocean

    
Some drops are hard as stone     
It takes millions of years to make     
them and millions to dissolve.    
    
Some drops are like salt ball     
It takes longer to make them     
but they dissolve quickly.    
    
Some drops have a dirty smell     
When those merge into the ocean     
for some time there is a bad smell around them     
but very soon they also disappear.    
    
Some drops are of good smell     
When those merge into the ocean     
for some time there is fragrance around them     
but very soon they that also disappear.    
    
Nothing remains, whether it takes time or happen quickly.     
Nothing remains, whether the drop is good or bad.     
Nothing remains, whether the drop is beautiful or ugly.     
The drop gets dissolved in the ocean.    
    
From where the drop of water comes?     
From a bigger water pool.    
    
From where the water pool come?     
From a river stream or rain.    
    
From where rain comes?     
From the ocean.    
    
From where ocean come?     
Well, it is part of the earth,     
from whatever source earth comes     
water comes from the same source.    
    
After coming into existence     
does drop have an identity?     
Well, if not so then how can we say     
that this is my water and that is your water?    
    
You will say that I know this but drop doesn’t know.     
But how do you know that drop doesn’t know?     
How it is possible which is the source of every life     
on this planet itself is lifeless?     
We can discuss this some other time.    
    
For now let us see, how long a drop lives?     
Well, it depends on the size of a drop     
and also depends upon the surrounding of the drop.     
In a hostile environment like a desert,     
burning stove, or flood it will die quickly.     
In another environment, it can have a longer life.    
    
And how a drop takes birth, live, and die?     
A drop can know experimentally     
that I have come from the ocean     
Live on the surface of an ocean     
And merge in the ocean     
My dissolution and disappearance     
is called death by the surrounding     
but very next moment I appear     
on the other part of the ocean’s surface.    
    
And many times I join other     
who are mourning my death from my past life     
because they think “that” drop was the great drop.     
So we should offer some flower to that     
and remember the work that drop did.    
    
Yoga was the way drop lived     
Whether you sing or dance,     
Cry or weep, laugh or smile     
eat or drink, breath or blink     
Create or destroy some other drops around     
Every moment you are navigating     
your life from one corner to another corner     
on the surface of the ocean called consciousness.    
    
Whether you do Bhakti yoga, sing, dance,     
pray and praise your Lord.     
Or you do Karma yoga, work without fatigue     
and surrender all the results     
of your action at the feet of your Lord.    
    
Whether you do Hatha yoga,     
control your physical and mental body at your will     
Or you do Gnyana yoga,     
know your true nature,     
transcend the Maya around     
and live the way like you are playing     
on the ground because have time.    
    
All are the ways of dissolving     
your little drop to the cosmic ocean     
And be one with the cosmos.    
    
How long you will protect your drop     
One day it merges to the ocean     
from where it has come.     
On this planet, that process is called death.    
    
But if you do this consciously     
and let it happen every day then     
the same process of unification is called Yoga.    
    
While sitting at a place we think     
Only time is changing and the place is the same.     
But on a planet that is moving     
with 67,000 miles per hour around the sun     
And rotating on its own axis     
with 1000 miles per hours     
It is foolish to say that we are staying     
at the same place even after one hour.    
    
The truth is we moved millions of miles away     
in the sky, since the time we have taken birth.     
But the drop never knows that and neither bother     
because drop rises from the ocean     
and fall back on the surface of the ocean.     
And this is the only and limited experience of a drop.    
    
Those who are counting Atma or soul     
are counting drops on the surface of the ocean.     
Without knowing the size of a drop!     
Without realizing the depth of the ocean!     
Without realizing that the ocean is also a drop in space!!    
    
What is the way to know you are drop?     
What is the way to know     
you are a deer who have musk in your own body?    
    
Nothing. Just stop running     
and spend your time and energy knowing this.     
But the real question is     
what will happen even if you know you are a drop?     
And the next question is,     
why should I know, which I already know?    
    
What Karna did even after knowing from Kunti     
that her real mother is Kunti and not Radha?     
That was the moment of realization     
for Radheya that he is Kaunteya.    
    
He still fought on behalf of Duryodhana     
He still wanted to kill Arjuna     
But we know fighting was not the same for Karna     
something fundamentally has changed     
in him after this realization.     
That is the power of self-realization.    
    
If you truly know that you are a drop     
then something fundamentally will change in you     
Perhaps your dissolving will not be painful.    
    
Perhaps your reactions     
to the surrounding will turn into the response.     
A response that is appropriate     
and need of the hour     
But free from jealousy, anger,     
competition, compulsion     
and desire to demolish other drops.    
    
Perhaps your madness for enjoying     
every drop of your life juice will reduce.    
    
Perhaps your madness to exploit     
the planet and lives around will diminish.    
    
Perhaps the way you talk     
and think about others will alter.    
    
Perhaps you will move beyond     
grief, sorrow, happiness &amp; joy     
and enter into unconditional blissfulness.    
    
O Chaitnya, you may be thinking     
this all is mental imagination.     
If so then the entire Vedanta is imagination     
and your reality is much horrible without a solution.    
    
Do you think millions of people     
in Indian civilization spend thousands of years     
and the best gave us is Vedanta     
and that is just mental imagination?    
    
Perhaps they knew what is good for us     
and we don’t know what is good for us     
that is why we struggle all the time     
to protect &amp; survive our drop and nothing beyond.    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat

Until Next Time Stay Blessed.
