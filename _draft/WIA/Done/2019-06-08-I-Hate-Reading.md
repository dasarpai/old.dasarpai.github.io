## I Hate Reading

    
Childhood was over and I was in school     
I need to read books and write exams     
Teachers and parents made it painful for me.     
I hate reading,     
I wanted to quit reading but     
the only solution was to get a job.    
    
I got the job in IT and I have to read more technology books     
than I read in my school &amp; college     
Initially, I enjoyed it but when I realized     
these people are writing more books every day     
than I can read in my whole life.     
I hate reading     
I wanted to quit software development.    
    
I realized management is easy     
one become boss just by reading     
a couple of books and having an MBA degree.     
So, I entered in the management profession     
Life was tougher, there is no end of     
theories, methodologies, frameworks,     
principles, processes, models, bodies of knowledge.     
One has to read all that and apply     
But, for that, you need to read human behavior,     
the behavior of my customers, my team,     
my management and competitors.     
In management, I also have to become responsible     
for the work of my team and     
without reading the human mind it was not possible     
I am a lazy reader and I hate reading    
    
But after reading hundreds of book,     
I wanted to quit management.    
    
People told me to become a religious person,     
You have to read only one book and life will be cool     
Being Hindu I read Bhagwat Gita     
and thought I can settle now     
But to my horrible imagination     
Hinduism has so many religious books     
Which entire management profession do not have     
and on top of that in the Sanskrit language     
I read many books and became tired of reading.     
There was no sense of accomplishment.     
So, I wanted to quit reading.    
    
In 2018 I thought Artificial Intelligence is a new field     
I have to read less here so let me move to AI     
I started my journey in AI     
And to my disappointment     
To understand AI, I have to understand     
everything from my school’s mathematics,     
Everything of my technology career,     
Everything of management     
and Everything of business processes.     
From which I was running away     
Is running behind me.     
On top of that this field is changing so fast     
that it is driving me crazy.    
    
With technology, a change has come,     
I need not read much     
If I can listen, observe, analyze, apply and bring change     
Then I can avoid reading.    
    
I am a lazy reader and     
a person who hates reading     
But, I have to read thousands of books     
on a different subject because of my need     
What is the result?    
    
Now I am realizing that I don’t anything!     
On top of that when I see happy people around     
I feel why to read all this?     
One can be happy even without knowing anything.     
I heard ignorance is bliss!    
    
Then I realized it was not about happiness or bliss of life     
But to swim in the ocean of my own ignorance     
Trying to touch the boundary of infinite ignorance     
Infinity does not have a boundary     
So keep swimming your whole life in this dark ocean.    
    
But after knowing the immensity of my ignorance     
I started feeling, yes this is knowing.    
    
And life is about knowing that ONE     
who knows everything     
even without any struggle.     
Knowing that I am that knower of everything.     
I am that knower who knows about the ignorance     
That knower who is is taking rest     
in the physical body, social body, and cosmic body     
That knower which is traveling     
in the dark ignorance of all the bodies.     
And that knower who will exit     
from this physical body one day.     
But will exist always     
as a part of the social and cosmic body.    
    
O Pratibimba, to experience this kind of knowing     
do I need to read further?
