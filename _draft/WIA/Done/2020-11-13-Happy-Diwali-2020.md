# Happy Diwali 2020
## What is the darkness?
   
A yearly festival of Deepavali has come  
People are wishing each other,  
Doing the shopping, giving gifts, and receiving gifts.  
People are lighting lamps so that  
the darkness around can be removed.  
This lamp will light for a few hours and days  
and remove the darkness around.

The lamp is radiating a physical light  
and dispatching away physical darkness.  
Physical is that which we can sense with our five senses.

Giving light to some dark room,  
dark street, dark home is a great gift on this occasion.  
This giving we do in the various forms like  
giving business, reviving the economy,  
showing compassion and care, etc.

But there are other kinds of darkness in our life.  
Hopelessness, Helplessness, negativity, jealousy,  
Fear of exploitation, injustice, oppression, slavery,  
Fear of physical, financial, and emotional insecurity  
Fear of loss of health, relation, reputation, and wealth  
Madness to show off, living a flamboyant lifestyle  
All are non-physical darkness of the human mind.

This Deepavali, May we light such lamp  
which can remove this darkness  
from ours and others’ life.

May we distribute such sweet  
which can dissolve the bitterness of relations around.

May we open our arms  
and hug those who are feeling dejected and alone.

May we light a lamp in our thinking  
which makes our home a happy place to live  
and not a godown to store lots of material and gifts  
where we don’t have a place to sit on the ground.

May we do all this not because  
we want to show off to others and selfie.  
Let us do it because we are serious  
for celebrating the festival of Deepavali  
Removing darkness and distributing sweetness.

O Chaitnya! may you get that wisdom in your awareness  
with which you can celebrate your true Deepavali.

Happy Deevapali

Hari Om Tat Sat  
Yours Truly Hari
