# What Is Violence   
   
In nature every entity has life.     
Life means takes birth, grows, decay, and die.     
Look around and identify     
what is that which is permanently there?     
A lifetime of life may vary     
from microseconds to billions of years.     
But everything comes into existence and disappears.    
    
Every life has its parts     
e.g. human life has parts like head, hand, feet, brain, etc.     
and all parts put together make a complete system.    
    
The system automatically consumes     
the necessary things from the surrounding     
without much efforts     
like air, water, etc     
provided they are available     
in good quality and quantity     
else system and in turn life need to struggle.    
    
If struggle fails then the system collapses     
and living body die.     
This principle applies to all lives     
including plants, insects, animals, etc.    
    
Every system automatically throw away     
some waste, which is not required by the system     
If the waste does not come out automatically     
then system and life need to struggle to throw away     
if struggle fails then life get disease and     
dies over time with that disease.    
    
The automatic output of every system is different     
in a plant, it is a leaf, fruits, flowers, etc.     
in the animal being it is milk, urine, poo, sweat, nails, hair, etc.    
    
Nature has made a system in such a way that     
every output of some living system     
is input and survival for other life.     
Nothing goes waste.    
    
The only question is a particular output     
becomes the input for whom.     
e.g. waste of cut vegetables     
can be food for cows or maggots.     
Depends on how sensibly you generate output     
And how sensibly you feed the next system.    
    
Now the truth is     
if the input is not available     
to a particular living entity     
at the time of need then it will die.    
    
There may be an abundance of food in the world     
But time and place of the availability matters     
If fertilizer is not available at the root of the plants then it dies     
If insects are not available to the birds in their area then they die     
If the grass is not given to the cow then she dies    
    
Every life fights its best for survival before it dies     
Herbivores, carnivores, omnivores     
has a different kind of fights and with different lives.     
This fight for the survival of the self is violence.    
    
The least violence is done by those     
who cannot travel like plants and trees?    
    
Most violence is done by human     
who can do anything     
even make or buy sophisticated equipment     
to fight and win at any price.    
    
If enough is available then     
animals, birds, plants do not fight     
with each other for survival.    
    
But the fight of human looks illogical.     
Even if enough is available he wants     
to have more for tomorrow     
not only for him but for his own people     
not only for one or two days survival     
but for the time till he dies     
And he thinks he will never die     
So keep in the go-down     
as much as possible    
    
So they turn houses into go-down     
Without realizing that if they die tomorrow     
There is not container service available     
for the place where they go after death.    
    
Human does not fight only for body survival     
but the survival of his ideas and thoughts post his death.    
    
A human fights for the ideas     
of somebody whom he likes     
i.e. Communist and leftist     
people fight for the ideals of Karl Marks     
and Gandhian people fight     
for the ideas of Mahatma Gandhi.    
    
Human fights for his group.     
A human fights for the dominance over others.     
Human fights for proving himself right.    
    
Human creates something for peace and harmony     
and if somebody disturbs that     
then human fights for that also     
i.e human fights for religion.     
Basically, religion is a system for peace and harmony.     
But a human fight for that as well.    
    
A Human fights for his taste.     
If he like the taste of something     
then whether it is live or dead     
must be served on his plate for his enjoyment.    
    
To survive every living needs some input.     
If that is not easily available then     
life fights with the other lives in nature.    
    
Look it from the human perspective     
when we fight we get mental and physical exertion     
and with whom we fight the same happens to that as well.    
    
Let us assume for sometime     
you are living in a far village     
In that village, there is only one home     
and you are alone in that home    
    
Today you are feeling hungry     
you want something and nothing is available around     
so you need to struggle.    
    
You enter into a forest next to the village     
and you find a dead goat; running chicken;     
freshly fallen fruits from the tree; other hanging fruits,    
    
Ask yourself what will you do     
and what will you eat?     
Fallen fruit or hanging fruit or     
catch the running chicken or cook the dead goat.     
It will help you understanding     
how violent you are on a day to basis.    
    
This is not a question of religion     
This is not a question of survival     
When enough is available then     
what we prefer to eat is a matter of taste!    
    
Every living being does violence for the survival     
Eating a fallen fruit is one kind of violence     
Plucking the fruit from the tree is another kind of violence     
Eating a dead goat is one kind of violence     
Eating a running chicken is another kind of violence    
    
The highest degree of violence is where     
eater and eaten both fights     
for survival and both are emotional beings.    
    
Ask yourself in nature     
Whatever input you are consuming     
is made for your survival or     
some other kind of life is entitled to that.    
    
The biggest problem is     
human thinks life on the earth     
is made by the god for him.     
So if we do not enjoy then who will enjoy it.     
The thought that this phenomenal world is human-centric     
is the disease of the human mind.     
And this is the cause of high violence.    
    
Oh Pratibimba, it is possible to cure this disease by compassion?
