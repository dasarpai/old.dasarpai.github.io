# The Play Is Over   
    
When I was small, I used to cry for toys,     
My parents gave me those     
I played with those toys, very seriously     
So seriously that if someone hides them     
or break them I will create huge unrest in the family     
I will cry from the top of my voice     
And let others know what unjust has happened to me.    
    
As time passes in life     
My toys keep changing     
Every step I move forward I was laughing     
at the toys of the previous step.    
    
Education grade, degree, job, promotion, marriage, children, their marriage,     
their settlement all are our toys.     
When these toys are around us     
We use to take and play them seriously.     
And so seriously that we are ready     
To do anything to acquire a better quality toy     
We are ready to do anything     
To polish and to maintain a good toy.    
    
Even in childhood, I knew I am different     
and my toy is different from me.     
We both are not the same.    
    
Now, I am experiencing my body is also my toy.     
Because I am not a body and     
I am playing in the field using this.    
    
Now, I am experiencing my emotions,     
mind, intellect are also my toys.     
Because I am neither of these and     
I am playing with these.    
    
Do you think this is the sign of Play is over?     
I think I can still play without letting others know that     
I am not serious about the game now.     
I am not serious about the toys now.     
I am just playing because of the inertia     
of earlier plays keeping me in the ground     
and moving this body     
from one corner of the field to another.    
    
I can experience this play,     
which my body is playing the field called Samsara.    
    
O Chaitnya, Have I understood Maya?    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Yours Truly Hari
