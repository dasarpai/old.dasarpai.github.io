# About Food And Nourishment   
        
We have three living bodies embedded together     
But superficially it looks one.     
When it comes to nourishing, it is our responsibility to nourish all three.     
Consuming food that nourishes the     
Only one body and ignoring others is not wise.     
If you do it willingly, then it is a type of slow suicide.    
    
Since childhood, if you are focused on     
The food of only one body then     
You cannot experience     
your own existence in the other two bodies.     
Because it is almost dead or ignored so much     
that no voice of nourishment need     
reaches your current level of living.    
    
The food of all three bodies is different.     
Different foods are rich in different content and different nutrition,     
so they nourish different bodies     
with different degrees and different ways.    
    
Those bodies are gross or physical or matter-body.     
Emotional, intellectual, energy body.     
And your causal body, which is supporting your two bodies,     
cause of your beyond body existence,     
beyond time and space body,     
in quality, it is one with the universe.     
Sanskrit text refers to it as JivaAtman.     
In fact, it is not a body in a physical sense     
Because it is beyond matter and energy.    
    
Food can be grain, vegetables, milk, meat,     
egg, fish, flesh from other life, or fruits.     
It depends upon your culture and geography of living.    
    
Food can be ideas which you get from others     
while interacting or observing others.    
    
Food can be internally generated emotions     
when you feel for somebody or some cause or some event.     
These emotions feed our energy body.    
    
Food can be sweet, bitter, salt, sour, pungent in taste.     
And even these six tastes can be in     
the different degrees in the different food.     
The sweetness of apple and sweetness of sugar     
are different in quality and grade.     
The sweetness of the emotions of hugging your child     
and hugging your best friend is different in quality and grade.     
The sweetness of feeling one with your God     
and one with your life partner is different in quality and grade.    
    
Some foods are more juicy     
And some are more solid     
Some are good for your muscles     
Some are good for emotional development     
Some are good for spiritual development.    
    
When I see the madness of people around the food     
I have nothing other than to smile     
at the so much focused thinking in one direction     
that in other dimensions they become bankrupt.    
    
Two see this, ask yourself,     
why some people are very solid in their physical health     
But they are bitter in their emotions?    
    
Why are some people, who are highly emotional     
for their loved one or God or guru,     
but intellectually bank corrupt.     
Lost the ability to think independently?     
They cannot hear even     
a single unpleasant word about their loved one.     
Not only that they can disturb themselves     
or the speaker, even if a speaker is saying the truth.    
    
Why, spiritually advance looking people,     
suffer loneliness and need a crowd around them     
to serve them to make them happy.     
Where is the feeling and experience of oneness?     
Is that only for books or just one-time phenomenon of life?    
    
Why people who are intellectually sharp     
cannot stand and run for one mile on a road?     
And other times they fail to connect     
the miseries and joy of others?    
    
Why do people eat animals but love their pets     
so as if they are biological children?    
    
Why do people love their own biological children     
but don’t feel the same for other children?     
If all this is not intellectual and emotional disability     
then what is this called?     
If this all is not because of improper nourishment     
then what is the cause of all this?    
    
Some much has been written,     
will be written on the food that it is an industry itself.     
Even well know experts who are recommending     
all sorts of healthy food to others     
but doing slow suicide of their own in their other bodies.    
    
Don’t we see that super successful people feel alone?     
Super rich people living on pills?     
Super intelligent people are dry and emotionally dead?     
Super wealthy people behave like beggars?     
And a muscular person is lacking the ability     
to comprehend philosophical ideas?    
    
You think eating two times or three times is a must     
otherwise, your overall development will not happen!     
People work hard, make money for eating and     
see around how many people are really happy!     
I mean really happy without any     
support of other people, object, entertainment.     
They cannot. What we see is not called happiness     
but the addiction to food.     
They need something and someone     
all the time otherwise they will crash.     
The presence of other people around them     
is food for them to live happily.    
    
You take this modern medical diet system     
of fat, protein, vitamins, carbohydrates,     
and their sources so seriously     
that you don’t even ask questions about     
how Yogis or Forest dwellers or beggars are much happier     
than you, who work so much just to eat healthy food?    
    
Human is the only animal on this planet     
who doesn’t know what to eat, when to eat     
and how much to eat even     
after living 20, 30, 50, or 80 years on this planet.     
We have religion on the food.     
We have universities on the food.     
We have industries on the food.     
We have experts, doctors, nutrition, religious gurus talking about food.    
    
But animals without all this grand system     
Who lives a much shorter life than humans     
never get confused about what to eat and what not?    
    
It is we who make animals our pets     
and dictate their diet and food     
as we dictate for our children.     
We are confused, we confuse our children     
and we confuse animals, birds     
and reptiles whoever we take as our pet.    
    
Food is for nourishment.     
Nourishment is not only about eating.     
Many times, not eating is also nourishment.     
Go only juice diet for few days, experience that.     
Go only water for few days, experience that.     
Go without food for one day and experience that.     
Go only with a particular taste     
for a couple of weeks and experience that.     
Leave one taste for a few weeks and experience that.     
Drop one-time food for a few weeks and experience that.    
    
Go on silence for a day and two and experience that.     
This is one kind of food.     
Sit at someplace for sometime     
without doing anything physically and mentally     
this is another kind of food needed for your body.    
    
Live alone in a forest or secluded place     
without any friend and family     
This is another food needed to know your own existence.    
    
O Pratibimba, Spiritual means spirit, it means not matter.     
To know and experience yourself as a spirit or Atman     
one needs to design many experiments.     
Spirituality is not only mental and intellectual gymnasium.     
It is also about knowing the self as     
beyond physical, mental, and intellectual food.    
    
It is about experientially knowing yourself     
as unborn external Atman.
