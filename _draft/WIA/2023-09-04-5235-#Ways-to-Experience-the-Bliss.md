Human is searching for peace and want to experience the bliss. Human want to get it by searching. We search for knowledge then we search for work then we search for money then research for network relationship and power.

When you have little time to think and reflect what you have done and what you achieved then sit for sometime and think. Those who have money are the peaceful and experience the bliss? Those who have power network and resources are the peaceful and experience the bliss? Those who have knowledge to run the business manage relationship earn the livelihood, so called smart people, do they experience the bliss and have peace? Those who know scriptures and their holy books are the peaceful and experience the bliss?

Unfortunately money power knowledge nothing can help you be peaceful and experience the bliss. Because this is all about the accumulation and you want to experience the bliss, which is your own nature the acquiring something which is yours but not you.

Having money power knowledge solved lots of the problem around us and gives the temporary solution of our permanent problem, restlessness of mind, desire to do something, desire to get something, desire to become something.

The right way to the peaceful and experience the bliss is to Transcend the work money power and knowledge. Dropping the desired to get by doing. But knowing what I want to get I already have. But this is extremely difficult because we do not experience that we are full where we want to achieve the already are at that point. And this happens with because we want to justify our desire of running working doing. Because human is rational did ask that question why I am running working or doing. Answer they give is to get something or achieve something which is highly important and meaningful.

What is meaningful and what not we decide that and after achieving that meaningful we still remain restless. It is not only we are doing it. There have been people in the past who have been doing it and there are the people around us who are doing it and they didn't get that piece and bless but we think we will get it.
