# “Have you ever thought?” - 21-Feb-2005


In a poor village of innocent peasants, people work hard from morning to night, from January to December, from winter to summer they earn a little money because of poor economy, big part of that money they give to a trustworthy man of the village for improving the condition of village, like providing electricity, good road, clean water, quality hospitals, quality school and college education, to generate better employment condition in the village so that their children can live happily in the village and need not to run away here and there for their livelihood. But this trustworthy fellow misuses money, he do not feel responsible, he do not feel guilty about this. Later on some irregularities were proofed, he were brought to court and some other fellow was placed in place of him. 

But what happened to the hard earned money; to the time spend in earning that money; to the time in waiting for the best. This responsible man’s family eat big part of the money and forget what happened, remaining money goes in fighting court cases bribing here and there so that they can be released with honor. Next year other fellow does the same thing and so on. 

Number of time matter goes in court, but because of money they come in power, due to the same reason they are out of the scandal. People are frustrated over day-by-day, year-by-year. None is responsible or bothering about their money that they save for betterment of the future of their children their nation. Finally a fellow (so called journalist) thought that why not to have a personal heart to heart chat with one of the person who has been so called trustworthy person once. The question he put like, why you people do these kind of scandals? Don’t you have shame or pain in doing so? Don’t you thing that god is watching you? Don’t you think that illwill of so many villagers will finish you?

His reply was, it is a politics, we pay a heavy price to come here, to be here, from where we will bring this money. This village needs leader, it cannot survive without leader, I am here, I can pay, initially, but throughout five years how can I serve you without using public’s money. So public give us the right of using their money. Now it is our money, they cannot live without leaders and we cannot live without this money.

I was totally satisfied after listening the answer. We need leaders; we can survive without food, water, roads, electricity, schools, colleges, hospitals etc. but we cannot survive without leaders. As millions year ago each group of the people needed a powerful healthy leader for their defense otherwise some other group can kill them, we need it today too. Otherwise Pakistan or other country will finish us.

This same thing is correct for each level of organization whether it is village, district, state or nation. The same kind of scandals are happening everyday at every level, but why should we bothers. Yesterday it was “bofors”, “fodder”, “coffin” today it can be “bullet proof” jackets or thousands others.

Readers and friends I think you are also agree with me that we need leaders, this is vital for us, we cannot live without them, they can be people of any educational, emotional, ethical background. Anyway why should we ask them about the money which we give them. Anyway they are not god to server us free?




# Watch Burning Corner - 21-Feb-2005

What has happened to our culture? Whom we are copying? Are we really paying respect to talent or to manupulators? How much this glamour is influencing our personal life? Sometimes it seems that prizes are decided and declared by media. Who will go up and who will come down is decided by media. Why we seek short cut for everything from eat, health, success, love to cloth etc.?
Do we actually know what we are, who are our ideals of todays time and past time? 

People are dying for money, fame and power and to get these, they can do anything from abusing their parents, culture, country, relations and even murder, robbery, decoty, repes and selfexposure of ladies is very normal in todays scenerio.

What is our culture, some fundamentalistic people see it from very narrow angle, other people counter that and when they win they debate they say our culture is narrow minded, we are close. I am so much upset that finally I stopped wathing TV, listening radio, reading newspapers. I just read books of my relevance and search internet for my relevence.

As a common citizen of this country I am very much upset when I see people who are barely having enough study know, but know how entertain by dance, showing style and exposing themselves are getting good money, travelling world, coming in politics and controlling power etc.

Here I will not pin point any big or small new entrant entertainer, cricketer, sportsman etc. but you yourself can see that these people are average minded, extra lucky or manipulator in this cut throught competition. They come on TV we pay for their opinion on our culture, way of thinking their ads etc and we are happy.


# Where my nation is Busy! - 21-Feb-2005

Why we think that study is solution of every problem around us? Why more than ninty percent people of this thinks that if we study hard, we will get good marks, if we get good marks we get good job, when we have good job, we can marry to beautiful girl, when we have beautiful girl our family will be perfect and our life will be perfect.

While this theory has been proved absolutely wrong more times than it was proved correct. It is just because we are lazy, we have inertia, and sitting at one place and studing is working with that inertia? Is it because we think that this work has been given to us by God and we should finish it first, after that whatever is outcome, He is responsible, so to make somebody else responsible for our destiny. 

Our current education totally fails when have to show dareness, character, dicipline, persistance, goal setting, chasing goals, being punctual, respecting nation/ neighbour/ friends/ patents/ gurus and ideals, showing strong faith in self and in god, having mission in life, having hope when surrounding is pitch dark, developing patience, developing leadership, being responsible, curing excusites like problems. And I bet you these are characterstics which has 80% weight when you want to make life 100% happy and successful, remaining 20% is what you study from LKG to Phd.

I believe “P Three Calm Verb Hafsec” Factor is critical to life education. This factor describes 15 characterstics.
    1. P-ersistant: To whatever you starts
    2. P-atience: For result
    3. P-unctuality: For time
    4. C-haracter: Be more deterministic in response.
    5. A-Attitude: Positive attitude for life, relations and outcomes
    6. L-Love: To everybody without expecting any return
    7. M-ission: Must have just mission in one life, and live your mission
    8. V-ision: Have a vision, work to realise your vision.
    9. E-xcitement: Be excited always no matter what happens to  your life
    10. R-Respect: Respect to your elders, colleages, country, neighbour and believe that they are god’s gift to you. No matter what they are.
    11. B-Belief: Belief in self potentials, in people you are sorrounded with and in mission and vision of your life.
    12. H-Helping: Help people whenever you have time, even sometime move extra mile for people without expecting directly from him.
    13. A-Action: Don’t procrastinate, act now for your vision.
    14. F-Faith: Have faith in God, that one day I will live my vision.
    15. S-Self Esteem: Respect your feelings, your body, your soul and high image about these
    16. C-Commitment.: Be highly committed for your vision and mission.
 
Above Factors decides 80% success of your life. School, college and professional education is not all. But we are really busy in studying hard, getting good marks, proving ourself before our teacher and parents who already are midiocre and do not know what path actually their children/student should follow in order to get success in life. 

Even in todays senario maximum people think that government companies are good, government job is good. And this is a different issue whether they are good or not but when we know that there are limited vacancies and government is passing its business to private secotor, why we waste our so much time in study for such a thing which is almost useless (when there are better option is available). Why don’t we take charge of our destiny early enough, instead of waiting upto 30 or 35 years of age.
 
This is the life cycle of any average person in my country. After their birth upto four years they reamin with their parents and learn how to fear from several things, how to obey, how stop thinking the way their parents think, like if they can not know the answer that is riduculous and unimportant that should not questioned again. How to make somebody else responsible for their mistake. What are my right in my home and what are resonsibility of my parents towards me. After he starts schooling, he resist study, skipping days and hours of any partucular teacher they do not like. They become pass they become fail. By the time they qualify their senior secondary they now, what is going around in our sorrounding. They now everything about politics, sex, lieing, helding responsible to other, their rights in this country, how they can enjoy, importance of their parents for them, sometimes they know what they want to become, in what kind of home they want to live in, what car they want to drive, different professions to earn money like film industry, TV, politics, modeling, kidnapping, terrorist. What they can do to live with pride like becoming teacher, government officer, doctor, engineer, lawyer etc. Very few people get entry into money making profession so they decide to study and think that their future is there, so they prepare for IFS, IAS after that PCS, after that they do BEd, MEd, Phd either they become teacher of professor. Very people are their who are professor by choice. They become processor or teacher because once they wanted to become IAS or PCS, maximum are following profession because of chance. And this too is good engouh if you become teacher or professor otherwise people just spend their age upto 36-37 in finding what they should for their remaining. When they start job some job, they feel they are old enough, life style nowadays is very hectic, too much pressure and rush is here all around and in this environement life is not beyound 50 or 55 years. So they plan to become rich in remaining 15 years time. They try their best, by doing unethical things, they wanted to enjoy fully and their philosophy is who know whether we will be tommorow or not so why to avoid serveral things in life and why to put hand cuff on their hands. So they do whatever feel can give them enjoyment, it may be righteous or may not be.

After that they have children, they were broke already with bad philosophy of life and after children they start expecting everything from them which they could not do in their life time. Children also follow the same philosophy what their children followed, they are not able to break the vicious cycle and poor remain poor, in the sense of matter, in the sense of sprit and energy in life.


# Change 21-Feb-2005

Change will happen. This is decided to happen. Because this is the only truth of the universe. Nothing is stationary, everything is change, and being part of nature we will also. Sometimes it looks that because we are changing individually that is why entire thing around us is changing. Sometimes it looks that we are changing because the universe is changing. What is truth? Both! 

By nature human being do not like monotoy. They seek change to break the monotony and change starts. Either he creats something new or he follow to someone what is already existing. This way within sometimes we feel that our entire surrounding is changing and remaining people want to become the part of that momentum because of the reason, that if they do not follow the grand change they will be perished. This way entire things get changed around us within a short time. This happens because of momentum. All kind of changes around us proceeds like this. What was uncommon yesterday became momentum due to any reason, and is very common today. Whether it is our culture, faith, cloths, like and dislike, food, language, color, home, furniture, hairstyle, fashion you name it and you will find that it was uncommon once, and today that thing is in vouge just because of momentum, and it is the world consiousness. And we are  part of this great world consiouness. Inertia is always against the nature. 

Change and righteous both are different thing. It is not necessary that whatever is changing around us is righteous. Some of the old things are good some are bad, some of the new things are good some are bad, this we learn with time. But who get experimented for this right and wrong, one who are courageous other who are fool. Courageous because they dare to step ahead to change and when they feel that it is not correct they change their course of action with minimal loss, fool because they just copy, they do not use their mind why and why not, they go ahead and even they perish they do not realise that we did something wrond.

The kind of relationships (specially between man and woman) we are seeing around us, kind of cloth we are wearing today, kind of language we speak to communicate today, kind of education we are having today, kind of aware we are having today is the part of change. It is a momentum. Mass people are following it. Very few realise that what is righteous in these kind of change and what not. Who we are folloing? Where we are flourishing and making rich ourself with these change or perishing here and now.


# Creativity - 5-Mar-2005

Guess, what makes a man broke man, average man and successful man. Yes, degree of creativity among these people. It is not luck, chance, having good circle, money etc. Just creativity. There are thousand and thousand of people who are very studious, very hardworking. From earning livelihood to getting fame and power they can do any amount of studies and hardwork even after they fail. The reason is they are very less creative. I am not saying study or hardwork is useless. But it is not as important as creativity. Nothing can beat creativity, neither study nor hardwork.

Now the question is what is this allien, who is pushing behind billions of people in the world. There is around 6.5 billion people on this planet and hardly .1% (6.5 million) are successful in there life. Why?

Let us see what is success and creativity. Success is progressive realization of preset goal(s). This goal may be anything, big or small. You must be happy, enthusiatic, proud on your achievement during working for goal and achieving your goal. And creativity is, by applying your mind making anything worthy than it was before you. This may be worthful for you, for the thing which you made worthy or for the society.

Studying hard to get good marks, to get job, to get good money is not a creativity. Thinking on a line which common people think is a problem but you make it a solution is a creativity. Here is my challenge to you to think about if you think you are creative. Here are few problems from common man’s angle, if you are creative, create a solution from these. There is one condition for solving these problems that you will have to work your self on the solution, you will decide your contribution, make minium burdon on government and society. I bet you, if you could create solution and implement on atleast one of these problems you will be rich enough and famous enogh for remaing of your life.

    1. Generally people think that after age of 60 people get retired, these people become burdun on society, they just read newspapers, watch TV, go to evening and morning walk just to survive few more years, remain at home to take care the grand children (if they are fortunate enough), go to old age home, where philenthropic people are funding for their food and selter for their remaining life. Can you give few solution which can make retirement very exciting and you wanted to become retire today, if that is applied by you or your society or you government.
    2. Generally roads in interior side are broken, either they are not made or digged by somebody due to any reason. We blame to government of india and our panchayat. Can you suggest what we can do together or what you personally can contribute?
    3. Our country is not poor country but money mismanaged country. Your add white money and black money of this country, in any things (production, service, trading), that is compairable with any developed country’s GDP. Now the problem is finish this vicious cycle of black money. If you are creative some idea how it can be finished and post that letter to Ministry of finance. My dear friend dare it, your country is not totally deaf, people listen here, it is different that they do not pay attention in initial. 

    4. Eletrcity is the problem in our villages, we blame government, can you suggest what we can do?
    5. Water is the problem in many place in our country, we blame governement, can you suggest what we can do?
    6. India is a place of problems. Find just one, start working on them seriously and your will be rich enough. Can you find one interesting problem for your self, instead of preaching others and discussing in conference room, pantry and on roads.
    7. We say that our population is problem for us. We may have one son or 11, we always curse our neighbour for this problem. Ok, let it be whatever it is don’t curse, can you suggest something which can make this thing blessing for you and your society? Instead of suggesting that muslim should go to pakistan. Old people should be killed. And we should be socialistic country like china. Nothing is in your hand, tell your self what you can do. Don’t Surrender.
    8. Space in metro is very less, even after that we are living in metro, just to servive. Even MNCs are investing funds in metros what can you do in your village or in your district so that governement or MNCs or Business Houses can get attracted towards you and you can be happy and make happy your society from your place. 
    9. Pakistan is bad country, terrorists are bad people, sachin is hopeless player, politics is bad thing, IAS people are corrupt, Laloo is currupt, scanal is bad thing, America is a cheater country, BJP is communial party, Congress is muslim party, SP is yadav’s part, my neighbour is this and bla bla bla. Instead of this can you suggest somehing and start working on something, which make Pakistan our best friend, terriost a poor chap, sachin is playing for himself and you play for yourself, politics a wonderful place where everybody want to come, IAS people becomes highly social, force Laloo to thing about bihari’s not about his bank account etc.
    10. Study is bad thing, we study a lot of subject, history, geography, maths, economics, hindi, english, sanskrit, etc 10s of subjects upto 12 and even after that reading many subject and when it come turn of life eduction we are zero. We are fail. Can you suggest something or start something at your end, which is creative.
    11. TV/Internet/Media is bad thing, it waste time, a lot of unrealivent matter is there, 0pornography is there, our culture is rotting with these bla bla bla. TV/Internet/Media can not go back to 18th century now, create something which make them powerful in good sense for public in today’s time.
    12. Sex is bad, sex education is bad, alcohal is bad, cigratte is bad, killing is bad, terrorism is bad. Do you have any idea how to counter these, instead of wasting your time in discussing these and blaming government for everything. Friends all these are big businesses in the world. Economy cannot run without these. These are super-power of our today’s economics, can you turn these things into friend of your society. Don’t say, surrender to these.
    13. Summer is bad thing, Winter is very bad thing, make something out of these two seasons, which can force you to wait for these seasons.
    14. I don’t like my current home, because my neighbour is bad, space is less, surrounding is not good, it smells bad here. Create something which make you fall in love with this home. I am not saying be stationary, because change is the only truth, we are forced to change with life, but we should not be blaming outside world always. Find solution inside and take action, either move or stay but do it with grace.
    15. Government departments are corrupt, people do not reach office in time, they do not behave properly, they are dirty people, government of India is dirty. Instead of suggesting privatization which you have listened several time from people around you, suggest something which is your own idea, which can dicipline these people instead of hanging them. You should be implementing the idea from your end.
    16. Manholes in your town remain open for many days sometime month and years, because municiple people are bad, suggest something what we can do to finish this problem.
    17. India is corrupt country, here people from living in slums to PM is corrupt. Here education system is very bad, here is no respect for creativity and talent. Suggest something what should we do, don’t tell that we should leave India and settle in US as your neighbour did.
    18. Intead of cursing your wife/husband that they are not good, your neighbours wife/husband is very homely, very good looking, very cultured, have manners, behave properly, she/he is highly educated, she/he earns good money also, she/he take care of children also, suggest somehting what should you do so that thing becomes exciting at home. You know that exchanging wife/husband is not legal,
    19. My boss/colleage is very pathatic, and fuse bulb, he does not understand me, talk to me properly. Suggest something which is unconventional and make everybody happy, don’t tell that kick off and quit.
    20. Yoga/Morning exercise is very good. I am having health problem, I can not wake up at morning, because of n number of reason. Creat a solution for yourself.
    21. People are begging on roads, some people say giving them money is good, because they too have right to survive, government says its bad, because these people are problem for law and order, they leave home places come here for begging, decoty, robbery and sex. What do you suggest for these people.

Running from problems is not a creativity. Finding some solution of it is creativity. Problem may be big or small but you have always something to contribute, in the sense of expanding the problem and in the sense of solving the problem. Choose what you like. You cannot remain neutral here. Not taking decision means also taking decision.

You personally may not like serveral things when somebody is doing it, or most of the time you too do not do it. But if once in a blue moon you too that, you have no right to held responsible to others. Create dicipline for your self, be on that, create examaple and help people in following you. No preaching to them and doing yourself samething for yourself.

# Disposition and Failure - 2-Apr-2003

Your disposition is terribly responsible for your failure. 

Life is like a journey of mountains, peaks are there, base of the hills are there. Man moves through out his life from one mountain to other, or one base to other, it depends upon his perception but actually he move through both. If you are at the bottom of hill and thinking you will go up, you need to equip yourself for the next climb, make your will strong so that your are not quitting due to steep up, strong heavy rainfall, heavy snowfall, speedy chilled winds, fear of wild animals. You are having sufficient food and equipment to survive the journey. You will reach at top. And this happens because of “correct position” of your mind at some time in your life. If you think there are too many wild animal, it is very cold, it is a heavy snowfall you could fall sick and consequently die, you can not climb it up because its too steep, you are not having anything or not any quality to conquer that top, you are alone there, you will go little up then come down, then go little up then come down, throughout your life you won’t be able to see the peak, you won’t be able to enjoy the sky up and world down at the same time! This happens because of your mental disposition. You are thinking about failure, you do not believe upon your success, you are not equipping yourself when the time is there.

If you are passing through some bad time, you are at the bottom of the hill. Don’t think low, because it is sure that one day you start moving up and if you are mentally dispositional you won’t try to go high. When you are at the bottom, it is the time to equip yourself. When you are on the journey many obstacles come on the way, but remember your objective is to reach at the top. You are living for that momentary pleasure which you cannot feel anywhere on this earth except at “top”. Journey of mountains is life, it is very important, but the “top” of mountain is success and man live and start their journey for this only, not for coming again at the down and resting there, then starting again as per their wish.

It is well know natural truth that whatever you think and plan strongly, when the good time comes either you get that or you stand nearby that. So why to think small? 

Moral of this text is correct your physical and mental position, and equip yourself when time is there i.e. when you are at the bottom of hills. You will never lament over any failure in your life.



# Don’t blame your God for making you average. - 14-Nov-2004

Are you frustrated with your life? And when you sit down for fifteen minutes to calm down yourself, you see people around are having their home, bungalow, luxury Cars, Children studying in best school of the town, they are flying occasionally from one place to other, they are enjoying vacations in five star hotels, people are having very powerful links etc., you feel that people are in more comfort than you, they are more happy than you. But have you ever seen the clear-cut difference between you and them? I hope, No! Otherwise you were not frustrated. 

Now I have just one question for you. Who gets victory, the fully-equipped fighter or the average person? Answer is obvious the equipped fighter. Your financially poor condition make you thirsty for money and brings more dissatisfaction, those things make you fighter. But the equipment to win the fight is your plans. You know you are below average, so concentrate on solutions of your problems, prepare plans for terminating your problems and take action as per your plans. It can happen only if you feel that there is some fight, which you have to win. Sometimes you may have thought that an average or uneducated person having his little shop or moving on the roads to sell things like vegetables, fruits, biscuit, namkeen, cloth etc. earns more than you! If you think that then you must be more unsatisfied. But you should not! Because as per his education that person is a financially average person, and he is satisfied, his chances of upliftment are less than yours. And the reason is you are financially below than average.

The conclusion of this text is threat and challenges makes you restless in life and that is the first important thing to fight the threat and challenges with. Average people do not feel threatened and challenged in life. So if you are blocked at some big red-light for very long time then don’t waste time in just waiting and thinking, plan about the alternative paths after that red-light to reach the goal in time, so that after the red-light is over you can move on your planned path.


# Enlightening - 15-Feb-2005

Three activities (listening, seeing and speaking) in our life impacts our all the decisions and all of our life. All organs attached to these activities has two face one internal other is external. On the similar line we two mind concious and unconscious. Concious is related to our external face of our organs and unconcious is related to internal face of our organs. Inner face of organ and unconcious mind helps us understading the truth, and external face of organ and unconsious mind helps us manupulating the truth, as per our likeliness. That is why most of the time it happens that what we listen and what we want to listen are different, what we saw and what we want to see is different, what we acutally speak and what we want to speak are toally different.

Consious mind is related to our consiousness in terms of our feelings (good, bad, hot, summer) and emotions (happy, sorrow, enthusiasm, excitement) attached to our body. This mind is highly analytical and influces the truth. Unconsious mind is logic less, what ever is passed by consious mind is stored into the unconsious mind. After something is stored there that becomes part of our intution and it keeps influencing our life time to time. At the infant age when consious mind is not too logical what ever kind of fear or strength you program those become part for remaining life, when you are sleeping and meditating at that moment either your consious mind is completely silent or mostly silent, at that moment what ever is said to you, is accepted as a tease, without any analysis. That is why sometimes dreams are so illogical, that we even believe them at that momemt, but when we wake, we realize how can I think so awkward. 

Information in unconsious mind is stored in the form of rules, regulations, guidelines, punishment and rewards form. Now when we see or listen or speak something why we not realise truth is because of manipulative nature of consious mind and due to this reason external face of our organs represent the fact in destorted form.

Will power is responsible to controls your consious mind and consequently actions suggested by this. More strong your will power is more you are able to control your consious mind. Now if you can control your consious mind firmly for the purpose of truth your perception and truth will become same.

There are few things which makes our will power weak.
    1. Listening more to consious mind and being highly logical always, suppressing inner voice.
    2. We are not clearly aware about the rewards of achievement
    3. We are not having good inner vision
    4. We listen to everybody just for the sake of listening and act differently
    5. We speak too much and finally miss what we want to achieve
    6. Public opinion matters more than soul opinion
    7. Temporary comfort, pleasure, pain, happiness have great influencing power
    8. Fear to fail
    9. Being very formal always, makes us unnatural
    10. Long term difference between what you say and what you do

There are few things which stops our learning further.
    1. I have not done it before, so I can not.
    2. It is tough
    3. It is not very useful
    4. Instead of this I have several other good things so why to bother
    5. It does not matter to me
    6. If it were so good I have learned it before
    7. I know it much better than anybody else
    8. Why are you telling to me you do it first
    9. It cannot make me happy
    10. It is painful
    11. Inertia to change


# Faith - 16-Nov-2004

Faith is a conviction that nothing will go wrong with you, in spite of all the odd and even of life. Faith is must to succeed in any area of life to move. You may be thinking where should I have faith and what kind of faith I should have? This I will explain you latter here I want to say you that 75% business, relations, happiness of life goes off just because of lack of faith. 

You are studying for exam and if you do not have faith that you will get good marks because of n number of reasons, you will never study seriously and you will never be successful. You start some business and you think that there is some other business which is better than this I must be doing that, you will not excel in your business (believing something else doing something else). You join some company after one month you feel that you are under paid here, or other company can pay you better, you will never do excellent. You sit on dining table, plate is full of various kind of food and you do not have faith in host that he loves you, you may think there is poison in at least one of the dices you will die hungry you will not eat. You want to go somewhere and you think that road is very risky everyday there is some ten new accident on the road I also can die on road, you will not move out of home, you are very drowsy, want to sleep and you have a doubt that there is snake in my bedroom, you will never sleep there at any cost, you are in deep trouble and you know that somebody get benefited by visited any particular saint or worshiping God, you will start doing the same thing, etc. etc. You name it and everything comes to faith first. If you do not have faith, you cannot move even a single millimeter in life. And faith is not physical, it is mental, it is spiritual. 

Now just imagine any thing which is not existing physically on this planet how badly it can change and effect your life and your decision making power. There is something, which we cannot see but it has the power to change everything what I can see. It controls our relations, business and happiness in life.

And I suggest you to move in life with full faith and conviction. Whatever you do just move with a strong faith that I am bless and highly favored, and I know I will succeed in this endeavor. Friends, if I have best in my life by no logic it imply, that you have inferior to me. I am having best because it is my comparison with other things, which I observe I around me. I have best job, I have best business, I have best boss, I have best country, I have best friends, I have best parents, I have best sister, I have best brother, I have best wife, I have best teacher, I have best home, I have best of finances, I have best of everything in my life. And believe me everything tangible or intangible, which you have today is given to you by god, you have no power to create and parish anything from your life. God is a great judge whatever he gives he gives on the basis of your input, input of all type like faith, hard work, sincerity, persistency, consistency, respect and love. So whatever you have today is best because of two reasons one because it is given to you by god on the basis of your input, secondly the effort put by you were best up to today tomorrow effort may increase so best may be something else.



# Focus.doc 02-20-2005

Focus

The problem within our society is we are not going where our focus is, sometimes we move into a totally worthless places/directions. I get frustrated when people discuss and waste longs many hours to discuss what they cannot change, do or that is others responsibility. Like how MCD should work, how politician should behave and work, how my neibhour shoould behanve with us, how pakistan should react on kashmir, what favour USA can give to us, what my child should become, how the school and colleges should be, how population is responsible for our problems, how my wife should behave, how my office boss should be reacting, how they can reward to their employees, how other countires are performing on world map etc. etc. Many million hours of my nations produtive hours are just waste into how and why of others, instead, if we people focus on how we can do something worthy for us, our family and our nations, why we are doing good, why we must do good, we can do really wonderful.

It frustrates me when people waste time in telling others and disussing others responsibility, my rights and how others should behave. 

There is a very old and good saying that It is not important what happens to us rather how we respond to it. Keeping above pharase in placew, if I assume that everything is wrong and corrupt around me, people are not responsible, politicians and beurocrates are bad everything is going into hell, I must ask myself, where I am individually going, what is my response to those peole who are around me.

Friends world is nothing but our reflection. Whatever you are seeing just because you are there where you are, you change your horizon you will see something else. Horizon can be changed by education, keeping yourself busy in constructive work, thinking self responsibility towards society, promising yourself to keep your tempo up always no matter what happens in world.

Be responsible for yourself, your family, your society, your country, not held responsible soebody else for these. Work your own plan not, not discuss others. Set examples and be leaders and be persistant, you will be recognised and ulitimately country will be respected in world.

This is a story about four people named everybody, somebody, anybody and nobody. There was an important job to be done and everybody was sure somebody would do it.

It ended up that everybody blamed somebody when nobody did what anybody could have done.

# God.doc 02-27-2005

The God

God is not something physical. God is a concept of super cosmic power, which is perceived by people in their own way. What a baby will think about the god when he becomes grown up man, it depends upon in what religion he was born, what impression his parents and priest leave upon him, what kind of time he pass through and how help came to him unexpectedly. What his teacher seniors and colleages at home, school, colleage and office say about God.

There is no question that whether god is here or not, question is whether we believe or not.

Faith is critical factor of success in any way of life, it does not matter on what you have faith, as deep is the faith that much high is the success.

I must understand it clearly that faith on too many things is harmful for my success, until I know they all are one and my concious mind can prove to my subconsious that this is the one and one only with different angles.

In hindu mithylogy significance of 33 crore gods signifies 33 crore wishes of human being. Whatever you want, worship related god with full faith and you will achieve that. This concept is for those people who are materialistic. In spritual sense there is only one god, which gives you ultimate happiness, it can come to you through one meaningful or “n” number of meaningful things in life.

It is not imporant how I worship or pray for him, neither what religion I follow, the most important thing is, in this universe under His sky, on His earth, drinking His water, brething His air can I feel His fire inside my heart or not, can I feel presence of His part in the form of Soul inside me or not.

I don’t believe that there is need of creating further more religions on any ground. Merging them is not possible because of fundamentalic approaches by individual stream and thinking the are the only messenger or God. Now we need science, and a subject at shool level which can help our children in understanding the God, without any religion. Whatever they follow is their culure in inheritency but they must know is the truth. How they follow it depends upon their comfortability.

Sometimes it looks that God is created to fear people from doing wrong things and encouraging him to do the righteous. But it is missused by the society.

Cockroach will Survive

Sometimes you may feel really worse in life. That moment must be thinking about quitting. NEVER ever do it. Life is made of many aspects and managing each aspect is highly challengable in itself. It may be your personal relation, relation with spouse, children, friends, parents, boss; it may be your health, job, death of dear one, losing of case in court, being beaten by opponent, failing in exams, damage to your esteem, clash of ego,  loss of respect, not able to achieve which aimed etc. Whenever you feel worse; you don’t like it; and some people quit.

You must remember that only who is living will succeed. There is no question of success of a dead body. So primary qualification to succeed in life is pass through the hard time. If you really want to succeed and passinate for it, never surrender to circumstances.

Everybody who has studied elementary biology knows Darwin Theory. Survival is the fittest. Only those who are fit and can cope up with the environmental changes will survive, rest will perish. Who is fit; and who can cope up it does not depends upon the size and power today. Darwin’s Theory is a nature’s rule and applies to every living being. Cockroach is the oldest living being on this planet. Who has survived hundreds of thousands of volcanos, earth-quakes, torandos, sea-disasters, wide change in earth temperature, food and water problems on this planet. None other than cocroach of that time is living today. Entire breed of hundreds of thousands of living creature is just finished due to the only one reason, they could not cope up with change!

I salute to the toughness and determination to survive of this living crature. We must be like that. No matter what kind of changes are happening around us. We are going to survive in any case, we must be like that.

# Loneliness.doc 11-17-2004

Loneliness

What is loneliness for you, whether it is being or feeling. Most of the time it is feeling, people feel loneliness even in crowd. In either of the state of loneliness, it is a problem, but it is critical if it is feeling. Because if it is being you can move out to a friend’s home, market or relative etc, but in case of feeling where to go? what to do?

I will tell you one powerful way to remove loneliness, after implementing this method you will never be alone in this universe even if everything is finished and you only survive here. Feeling is not physical, but mental. And I am telling you about the mental thing only.

Go near to nature, like some garden, wheat or paddy fields, mountains, plain long horizon. And watch it carefully, watch sun or moon or stars, see it upward, see down ward, see all around you. You will find different colors, life in different thing, life in day, life in sky, life in plants, life in birds, life in trees, life in fruits, see your self, feel how fit you are, who made you, who keep you fit, who cures you when you fall sick, what do you eat, from where it comes, from where the seed of grain which you eat comes, how one seed turns into many grains, one seed into many fruits, why plants are small, and trees are so big, why chilly is chilly and carrot is sweet, from where the taste comes, from where smell comes, how many type of different colors, taste or smell can we sense, from where they come, who make them. Friends what I am talking you about is not small thing, everything is very complex, not easy to make in labs by human beings. Somebody has created these complex things. Who is that, where has he gone after making all this. From where he is making all these things continuously, and we are not able to see him. Yes he is everywhere, he cannot be seen, he can be felt only, and that too when you want. You can see him when you believe that he has physical shape also and first become master of his feeling in and around you. Later on you will realize he is shaped in everything you see, not only in man’s or woman’s form. Now question comes when the creator is all around us all the time, watching us guiding us, caring us, loving us how we can be alone.

# Problems.doc 02-27-2005
Problem is perception of outcome of an event in time and space.

Don’t get afraid from the best teacher, love her and learn from her.

Just for the sake of understanding the meaning, which I want to convey you, imagine there is university called “Life”. Because it is my life so “I” is the only student in that university. There is only one teacher, the best teacher on this planet, but she does not speak, listen, see and feel. The name of teacher is “Problem”. As per the owner of university, “Nature”, “Problem” is a best teacher so in spite of a lot of complaints from students teacher is never expelled out of the university. As per teacher’s suggestion no theory is allowed in the university, only practical. There is only one evaluator in the university, “Time”. There are only two grades in the university “Success” or “Failure”.

Because of her inability to speak, listen, see and feel, she cannot communicate with student properly. She comes in the class, all of sudden, either from front gate or back gate, go to the board and write one exercise there and leave the class-room. This teacher comes in your class from time to time gives the practical to solve something. It again comes in your class and without asking you whether you solved the previous exercise or not she gives you another. Teacher comes again and again and puts a pile of exercises before you. You cry before her that you have not solved previous exercises yet so please do not come this time, please do not give me more exercises but due to communication problem she cannot understand what we are saying.

You may be an average student, good student or best student. It all depends upon how you react when the teacher comes and what you do after she leaves exercise on board for you. Your reaction may be either of these.

    1. You are taking the teacher too seriously and you cry whenever she enters and exits the class room.
    2. You do not take it seriously and let her come again and again.
    3. You do the exercise with your best efforts and learn some lesson out of it.
    4. You do the exercise but misinterpret the lesson.

And on the basis of your above  reactions your grade is decided by evaluator. Do not be too serious towards the problems in life but towards their meaning it leave behind in our life.
Problem is more a state of mind less physical existence. 


# Quality.doc 02-17-2005

Quality

We are living in the age of industrialization, where production for mass and service to mass is a way of business. Quality if something which is delivered to consumer as per his requirment on time. Quality is such an issue which is argued by even coolies, panwala, paperwala etc. Just to prove that they are better than others. But how to measure it? Sometimes it is believed that the quality is not only received but also perceived. Quality is a matter of satisfaction and it is sometimes internal matter. But we cannot ignore what we received in exchange of what we pay.

Quality is always delivered through some discipline, predicatable behavious pattern of product and provider. Discipline is developed through some set of good habits. Habit is something which encourage you to act seemlessly in some predicatable pattern. Developing good habit is really tough task. Most of the time the reason is not, that the work is hard, but behaving in predictable pattern, doing regularly for long enough.

For example today you decide that you have to take care of your health so you should exercise regularly one hour. And after one week you stop doing it due to any reason. This is not a habit so it is not a discipline too. If time is problem 15 minute will solve the purpose but regularly, thorughout the month, years and decades. After few month it will bring quality in your health. Some of you may be reguarly doing certain thing like tooth-paste, home as well as home cleaning, cooking, eating, reaching office in time, reaching at home. That is your habit, this the discipline. It will bring quality in your life.

Quality is not something which can be forced to taught in classroom. It is not something which you can expect always at the rate of threat or money. It is something inside prople and organization. No organization can be quality oriented till their people are indiciplined. One influential person becomes disciplined and quality concious , he creates momentum and other people become part of that momentum.

Now, how habits are developed? They are developed through strong determination and decision. It is developed through our attitude towards our belief our organization, our output, our selfesteem, our value system, our country and things around us.

Then what is attitude? What thought is continuously running in our mind is our attitude. We can change it through reading, association and acting. So if we want to deliver quality our attitude and organization’s conciousness should be towards it. It can be developed through reading good book on motivation, on quality, way of life, self conciousness and association with good people and last but not least behave or act like a quality person.

Oraganization all over the world, specially in developing and under-developed countries behave with their employees like they are instrument. People work physically for organization 10-13 hours per day on an average. Where is quality of their personal life, quality of their health, quality of their food, quality of their relation. And if it is not their, how long organizations can expect quality form a person who is qaulityless personally. Quality has to be practices and cultivated in long term. It should never be seen from short term point of view.

# Quitting Vs Transformation.doc 02-20-2005

Quitting Vs Transformation

Why should we follow our religion, culture related rituals, rule of the nature, rules of the country? Why should we preserve our heritage? Just because of fear of condamination or expeltion by society to us? Or just because these rules are made by God or Governement and we are made for following these rules? Or just because these are ours.
Second thought for you is if any good thing is available in my religion, my culture, my society, in the constitution of my country just because of this reason others relision, society, sulture and country does not become bad. Ultimately those things are created by human being as ours.
Frankly speaking in natural language human came first on this earth and then religion came with (system & belief kind of stuff) and then country. When people get divided due to various reason. And I feel prioritywise country come first god come second, family come third., I come fourth and my job comes fifth and then followed by other priority.

First of all we must understand today that whatever we are today whatever we are enjoying today, whater religion we have today, whaterver country, culture, rituals, system, constitution scientific descoveries we have today is nothing but created by our human ancestors. Second thing is before challenging any other human being whether they are your ancestors, parents, children, friends, colleages, we must give it a serious thought, then discuss with some wise prople (whomsoever you feel) no fight, no argument just discuss and listen the points carefully and then finally read about the system’s original texture, which you are challenging. It is easy to disobjey or distroy but difficult to follow or create.

Nowadays we have several problem, relating to serveral issues, like education system, religious system, AIDS, health, clothing, culture, internet, information explosion, peace and harmony among human being and nations, man-woean relation generation gap. Alcoholism, safety of woman, respect to nation, patriotism, agriculture, lifestyle.

Do we know why these are? Are we having constitution, religion, ritual, culture for solving these ongoing problems? Friends human being is result of change, nothing remain same, consitution, religion, rituals, culture has changed a lot in last 5000 years human histry, it is a continuous development. But the kind of chaos we are feeling nowadays I don’t think were felt in our history before. Reasons can be discused later. Society has not remained unchanged since last 5000 years and changed automatically today, but it changed continuously. People learned from last mistakes, they documented scriptures sometimes they modified existing sometime they added new in existing some times they created a separate brand new thing like religion, country and law are example of this. We know we are not perfect. Neither we should expect perfection because perfection means fault free and nothing can be fault free, next generation will find some fault in the system created by us. We must strive for excellence and do our best and excellent always. And that is what actually we are today.

Why I wrote this article today is because of our new generation’s rebelious attitude towards our system which are created by other forefather, whether it is religion culture or constitution of country. Today with globalization and information overload, due to internet/telcom/TV etc, we are much more psycological sick then before in history. We quickly conclude that otherside of field is much green and we keep moving from places to places in terms of rituals culture, clothing, system, country, society.

Instead of doing something for yourself, correcting yours, raising voice for yours, we decide to quit and join other party and we find same problem there too. We must understhand that today we need guruns who can help us in this huge transformation age not for religion and preaching and collecting votes only. Everything has its place in society but in today’s scienerio we need people who can fight the system it it is incorect, advocate it if it is corect, not qutter and joiners.

We don’t like congress goto BJP, we don’t like hinduism goto christinity, we don’t like India goto USA, we don’t like marriage rituals just start living with girl after saying I love you, we don’t like our colony we shift to pose colony, we don’t like city shift to “A” class city, we don’t like wife love to someone else. Dear friends thing quitting attitude is not correct, fight for the righteous, either amend or add something to existing instead of distroying existing and creating new. How many parties can be make now? How many religions do we need now? It is enough we should shrink them all into one and try to correct ourself first. Countires and religion are created by those who wanted recognition and power atleast, their egos were satisfied and they took pain for people just to satisfied their ego. What a comman man wants? Do you think that every human being on this planet should create his own culture, religion and country instead of adding value to existing and mearging all to one. Ultimately we are human being, natures greate creations! Unique and one only.

# Responsibility.doc 02-17-2005

Responsibility

You must be aware that responsibilities and authorities moves side by side. No one can be behind of other. So if you have authorities you must be aware about your responsibiliteis. But the problem is we know too much about others responsibilites and our authorities and vice versa. Some times situation is even verse, people are aware about others responsibilites but not aware about neither their authorities nor responsibilites. We are use to helding responsible to our neighbour, municipal, police, governement, media, terrorist, slums, technology for all things going wrong around us. But we do not know what could we contribute to improve the situation.

In over billion people population in India, there are very few good leader. And they too are not know, that is why they are not exampled and followed. Responsibility is such matter if every citizen of a country understands it correctly then we need not to wait too long to bring ourself on top of the world map. If you are a good leader you have good sense of your responsibility and when something goes wrong, you know where you did wrong in handling people and understanding people. Otherwise you will remain busy in catch hen.



# Service.doc 06-14-2008
Service

Once I heard a telephone company executive on telephone, solving (or complicating) problem of this client. His client was saying that why my telephone is not working, I have paid your Rs.1500 in security. And this executive was scolding him saying that what can I do people even have deposited Rs.5000 they too are facing problems, yours is mere Rs.1500. This problem is happening with everybody don’t call me Every time.

Now considering this situation who is correct? Although both have genuine problems but the reply of the executive is really pathetic. Because we are living in customer oriented society and here customer is always right. He is right because all the rules are made for doing best business in market, satisfying customers and customers tells business, if customer is happy rules becomes regulations to guide the business. Customer is not made for these rules. If any rule is coming on the way to serve customer that should be modified. Companies starts as small unit respecting these small customers and when they become giant, they say it it our rule.

Just imagine if everybody reply like this what will be the shape of our society, culture and our country. If patient dies in hospital and his care taker cries on the doctor that this is your responsibility to save him and you failed. Then instead of accepting the responsibility, learning out of it, paying fine if doctor says man this is not my problem everyday many people are dying here and they are also paying money, then what will be the situation?

If a victim goes to police station and ask for lodging a complain of her rape and do immediate action for it. Now if police inspector say that madam this is not my problem, everyday samething is happening to many people you are not alone. What can I do, lodge a report with patience otherwise go and don’t waste our time, that is your problem, then what will be the situation?

Customer is always right, vender may be right but how he handle the situation decides how good he is doing his business.

People Around You Are Steps Of Success Stair.

We cry throughout our life for the wealth, success, opportunity, happiness, respect etc. and we never get these. The reason is we do not recognize it, and when it comes to us in some different form we just scold these different forms of opportunities of success and it runs away from us (you know what I mean, you fight with people).

For the matter of understanding just see around you how many people are there. They may be your friends, relatives, aquatints, political leaders, businessmen, saints, professors, doctors, lawyers etc an endless list. You may have personal introduction to these people or you may not have, they may know about you or they may not. If you start writing down the name of these people whom you know just by name (may be live or not accessible on this planet), I am sure you can write thousands of the name in your note book. For example, you know the present president and prime minister of your country, his family members and relatives. You  know the most successful film stars, businessmen and their family members. You know your neighbors and their relatives and friends. You know your colleagues, your previous colleagues and their family etc. Have you ever thought who are these people whom you know by name or personally. All these people on your notebook are “steps of your success stair”.

Do not see people from their physical weight and height. See them from weight and height of their success, power, knowledge and wealth. Now, for example, you can see that the tallest and heaviest person on this planet is Bill Gate. He is so high that he is touching sky, he is so heavy that if falls some day he can crush millions of ordinary many people, like small ants, under him. The next weighty and high height person is president of USA. You yourself know his money and muscles power and his influence on the world politics; I need not to explain. Dead people who were powerful may be more powerful after their death because of their followers. Like Jesus Christ, Mohammad Paggamber, Guru Nanak Dev and several other spiritual leaders are not here physically on this planet but they have more weight and height today due to their large number of strong followers. So please do not ignore these people when you create an imaginary of different weight and height of people. Just stop reading this further and concentrate for ten minutes on the living and dead people around you in the term of their weight and height. Imagine they are standing in a very large cricket stadium, as per natural order, more height far from stadium and less height ahead toward the stadium, and you are standing at the mid of stadium.

Now if you want to touch a most tallest and heaviest person whom you can see from your horizon but very far from you due to population on this planet. What will you do? Will you go upside right just like rocket? No just impossible.

If you have ever thought the meaning of success for you then you must know what you want to be, to whom you want to touch, in this circle around you. Even if you want to go behind the tallest person, still you have to define which tallest person, because people around you have pretty good sky touching height in their respective area like wealth creation, politics, teachings, business, power, muscle, smuggling, terrorism etc. 

Once you have decided the area you know the exact horizon where your teacher or most successful man in your chosen field is standing. Once this is very clear to you, you have removed one of the biggest barrier of your success, and had made clear your goal. Because people do hard work throughout their life they move all around the circle in stadium but they are not able to move even a single step up, because they do not know what is the horizon which they want to achieve in their life.

Now you know all the people around you and your horizon is clearly defined. Now try to understand one thing very clearly, people are neither enemy nor your friend of your success no matter what relation they have with you. Now move around this imaginary stadium and ask any person, “Can you give me your shoulder for one second because I want to meet to a person just behind you”. This is as simple as asking to a person that can you tell me the way which leads to the main road. Depending upon his present emotions (like mood, attitude, thinking, kind of relation and intimacy with you, time etc) either he will say yes or no. If he says yes, be happy and climb up a ladder of success, if he say no, leave him and ask to next person, but don’t forget to say thanks, because you may need him again some where at some other step. The very clear reason is every person like you want to move up in the ladder of success, they are using other’s shoulders, because no one can go up directly just flying towards the sky from their own horizon. Do this continuously move around you the stadium, from day to night, from this month to next month, from this year to next year, but do not miss the ultimate horizon. You will touch the person to whom you want to touch, no matter how far he is from your current horizon. Even you can go behind him and make yourself tallest and weighty than he is, just by using his shoulder. But you must have patients and believe that you can touch him and at the same time not missing your ultimate horizon. Believe me there are people around you who are always ready to give their shoulder to you but you have to reach them and ask them.

Now decide your horizon (your goal), identify people around you, create a short term and long-term plan to reach to your ultimate horizon, and ask people, may I use your shoulder for one second please.

Success is yours.


# Success Disection.doc 03-05-2005

Success Dissection

First define what is success for you. Second find out who are/were successful in your view. They may be people of different background ( in the sense of family, country, education, physical ability, money, power, intelligence etc) but the only one thing common in them is “success”, which you define, which they may or may not have felt.

Now pickup anybody in history and current time, walk through his life and you will come to know how, where and when he became like this to whom you name success. Who are among these people, who had not worked against the stream, time, society, financial crunch, family support, physical-handicapcy, health problems etc. All the successful people have faced either one or more than one of these problems.

In common man’s sense success is possession of material power like money, recognition, fame, health, ego satisfaction, property etc. Although this is not an actual face of the success. Material is just one aspect of the “success globe”. Major part of it, you cannot see very easily. The qualities on which complete success stands, you cannot see very easily. And what actually success is at a higher level of abstraction you cannot understand with little efforts. For that purpose you have go to inside, instead of searching outside, because success is matter of internal satisfaction. And searching inner without spiritual and believe in supreme power is impossible.

In time and space with the kind of seriousness in effort and personal qualities, any body can become Bill Gate, President of a country, Thomas Alva Adision, Abhram Lincon, Mahatma Gandhi, Jawahar Lal Nehru, Vivekanand, you name it. Success comes from understanding mother-nature’s like and dislikes. When She is giving something She do not give my name, She can give to anybody who has that much seriousness about purpose and personal qualities as much by any “later turned” successful person had that time and space. Nature has not given any thing to anybody just because his name is good and he or she is Bill Gate, Mahatma Gandhi, Abraham Lincoln, Vivekanand, Roosvelt, Albert Einstein, Adision, Newton or any other successful person’s name. She gave because they understood and accessed the key with seriousness in the purpose and right personal qualities. At that point of time, at that place with that much seriousness in purpose and those personal qualities if  Mr.X were there in place of Mr.Later Success, Mr.X could have become successful. And at the same time it does not mean the Mr.Later Success will be out. Because there is no competition no merit. Whoever crosses the barrier of this success ignorance, can become successful. Equally successful if all have euqual seriousness of effort and equal personal qualities. But unfortunately it does not happen because of our attitude and we blame God.

If a paralytic person can become Olympic 100/200/500 meter gold medalist, deaf-blind-dumb can become a great musian, deaf can discover a electricity and can have hundred of patents in his name, unmarried age-old person can become president or prime minister of country, a truck driver can become billionaire, dumb of mathematics can change entire civilization by his physics and mathematical inventions, a college dropout can become richest man all over in the history of world, then what quality you do not have to become successful. And these are just few examples. If you are really serious about making your success, give it serious though and find out people and analyse those lives. If you cannot do this, you are not serious, you can never become anything until you change your this attitude.

You will never get a thing which you do not know, have heard about, have not seen. Because even if it comes to you, you will not able to identify it, so no use of coming. Success always comes and goes from you life. But you could not identify it, just because of your attitude and ignorance. It comes with many faces, which are sometimes very fearful and people drop it. First correct your attitude, develop seriousness of the purpose at your heart and make that your heart beat, develop the qualities required, then success will follow then matter will follow you.

And when you become successful, fortunately or unfortunately meaning of those things will change for you which have very high importance for you. They may have very little meaning or no meaning when you reach actual success. So instead of crying for success and matter search for that which develops and matures you for that purpose and never ever compare yourself with your neighbor or friend who has made lot of money and lots of property, lots of world travel but you are living in that same third class rented house and fighting for survival. Because it is in anyway never going to help you in becoming what you want to be. Wrong comparisons and jealousy is killer of sprit in the life.



# Survival.doc 11-14-2004
Survival
Survival does not mean to live only. It means to pass the tough time happily with learning. I love and have a great respect for the principles, which were discovered by Charles Darwin, in his book “Natural Selection”. In this great book he explains the rule of survival. Why dinosaurs disappeared suddenly and why cockroaches are surviving still today, which came on this planet many years before dinosaurs. The primary condition of survival is not how big or powerful you are, but how much adjusting power, with the worse environment conditions around you, you have. This principle is so universal that is applies to everybody and everywhere. If you want to learn survival learn it from any cockroach around you. They are very highly adjusting people, when they have power they rule over, when power goes away they become dormant or start serving to powerful. They know time will change and they will rule again, but for this they have to survive the bad phase of life.

========================================================

Purpose of my life is not to seek bread and butter for me, neither today nor tommorow. Because I do not like this purpose. Purpose of life is not to survive, but to survive with a strong purpose at heart. Purpose of life is to help people truly, to needy people and change their life greatly in a good way. Mine will change ultimately which is my seconry purpose.

Know about technology, insurance, motivation, spritualism and aware people. A lot of bad things is happening in society. Like sex scandals, money scandals, murders, loss of purpose of life & education, youngester without direction etc. A mission is there which in creating these things, another mission is there who is critising it, working against it. Both are commercial. Be part of either of these momentum. Do stand alone and wait till the end of life. People are getting whatever they want to get in life in either way of life.

=============================================================
I can carry on studying software, project mangment, software engineering, motivation, spritualism and write columns. Whether I am in job or not, but I must be busy enough to live the purpose of my life. I must study daily and write daily.
