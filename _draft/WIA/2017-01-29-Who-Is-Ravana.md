## Who Is Ravana?

    
### The Raavana 2.0    
    
Pratibimba got a temporary power     
A power to travel the time     
and then make others to travel the time along with him     
At that very moment, Pratibimba chose to travel to Treta Yuga     
He met Raavana,     
This is the time Raavana is in war with Rama     
But not killed in the hands of Rama.     
Pratibimba brought him along with him to the twenty-first century.    
    
Pratibimba asked Raavan,     
Why are you so arrogant, selfish, angry young men     
which caused you to do whatever you have done?     
I heard you are Brahmin of Treta Yuga     
Who knows all the Vedas, Jyothisha, Ayurveda, War sciences, Upanishads,     
knows good and bad conduct     
knows good and bad policy.    
    
Even after knowing all this     
You supported the wrong people,     
You did all which was controversial     
And for that, you got punished     
And your name is so infamous that     
even after many millennia no family chooses     
the name of their child after your name.    
    
Raavana said, what you read in Ramayana is Raamleela.     
It means the play of Rama.     
If it is His play he can play the way he wants.     
I am just a side hero of that play.     
You made me a villain.    
    
Ram is the Great of course,     
but highlighting my wrong actions     
Ramayana again heightened the virtues of Rama.     
So, Rama’s good deed makes him great     
but my bad made him the greatest.    
    
Whatever happened in my life,     
For me, it was not Leela     
For me, it was real life     
My study, struggle, desires, fight and result of fights,     
Win and lose all were real for me.    
    
But in the 21st century when I see back     
I feel that I have been used in the Leela.     
Used to show what all was wrong with me     
As if I was nothing but wrong.    
    
I am a typical guy in North India     
I am a resident of Meerut     
I am an ambitious, hardworking, devotee of the Shiva     
I am Brahmin and worked hard to achieve what I had     
Nobody has given me on my plate.    
    
In my life, I have done right and wrong as per the society     
I never realized it is so wrong     
Nor got opportunity to think and     
reflect my deed in a respectful way.    
    
In Treta yuga, they tried to outcast me     
and in Kalyuga you tried to outcast me     
That is why south Indian politicians have caught me     
And leveled me a Dravidian     
And you couldn’t have courage     
to stop and save me from them     
You thought anyway Raavana is bad     
so let him be taken by anyone whoever wants to take him.    
    
This way I was wrong in Treta Yuga     
and I was wronged in Kal-Yuga     
And today again because of no fault of mine     
I have become part of the dirty politics of the Bharat.    
    
I thought at least after my death     
I will be able to unite my Sanatana Dharma     
but even after my death     
When I have known my truth     
You people are playing Leela on my dead     
You are not allowing my bad to die permanently.    
    
I am part of Sanathan Dharma     
where Jeeva takes infinite birth     
do infinite karma in those births     
But was never thrown in the eternal hell     
or heaven for the Karma of one life     
And in one of those countless birth     
finally, one day I become one with the Cosmic being.     
But you are pulling me back again and again.    
    
If I am given a second opportunity to correct and     
to relive life then nobody can play with me     
I will be in control of my emotions, desires, anger     
I will be able to use these for my benefits and     
for the benefit of people around me    
    
In the last many years I have learned     
how badly the world sees you     
if you get played wrong by someone     
Or if you become part of some other person’s Leela.    
    
If I have to relive again.     
The name of the play will be Raavan Leela.     
And it will not be any less adorable &amp; inspiring     
than Ramleela of Balmiki Ramayana    
    
But in Kalyuga who will write and appreciate     
that kind of Raavanleela for me     
Because in 21st Century people     
of north, south, east, west     
are busy blaming Rama and making him a villain     
But I know I was wrong and He was right.    
    
Today when I am feeling to relive a life of Rama     
You are not giving me an opportunity     
Because you are singing the glory of that Ravana     
Which I knew was not on the path of Dharma.    
    
The time was over, Raavana vaporized in the air before Pratibimba     
Pratibimba still thinking about what has gone wrong with our society     
That Dharma looks Adharma     
and Adharma looks Dharma     
People in the society in the name of Dharma     
arguing in the favor of Adharma     
And this they call freedom of speech.    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Yours Truly Hari
