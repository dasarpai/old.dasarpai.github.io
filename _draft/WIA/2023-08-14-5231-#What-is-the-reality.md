# What is the Reality     

You see something on a table and you ask yourself what is that? Answer: It looks like an apple so it is apple.
Then you ask how many apples are there? Answer: You know the counting and after counting you say it is three.

It is a very simple process, isn't it? You know the truth, after asking these 2 questions.

In reality this is a very complex process. And you don't know the absolute truth. In fact, after this enquiry you may not be knowing even experiential truth. Experiential truth is that which you perceive from your sensory input.

Ask yourself, how many assumptions are there in the truth knowing process? Ask these questions to yourself.

Are my eyes able to see the surrounding correctly? Consider these statements: your eyes may have color problem (temporary or permantent or recently developed). You may not be aware about these. You may not be able to see the shape correctly. You may not able to see the objects at right place.

How do you know you can see correctly?
Hospital/pathology labs are places to test you and compare against the average parameters. If your parameters are away from the average parameters then you are abnormal. With this abnormality you may be able to see/perceive what other people cannot see/percieve or you cannot see even those which almost everyone can see.

Is lighting around the object is proper to see the object shape and color? How do you know how much light is enough and proper to see the world around?

Apart from eyes, is there any method to know the object on the table? If yes then can you use those methods on this object on the table? Touch, smell, taste can be used? Is there any restrictions on using those methods to know the truth?

How do you, what is three? It is not question only of linguistic that you call certain counts as three and not jhoomjha. If your number calling system were different you could have told "I saw jhoomjha apple on the table" It is just a replace of word. How do I know it is three? Our life is bound by certain experiences and our minds are bound by the language and culture. So what we know is the cultural truth, that we express in language which we know to speak.

In absolute sense it is impossible to know the reality the way it exists. We know the reality the way our mind is trained, human life is evolved, and language which we use to convey the ideas.
