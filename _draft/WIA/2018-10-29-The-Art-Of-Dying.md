## The Art Of Dying

    
Helplessly we take birth in some family,     
without our desire and control.     
Helplessly we die someday     
without our desire and against our wish.    
    
Human is not certain about     
incoming of next breath     
think constructing his building     
which can last for many hundred years!    
    
O Man, you do not have time     
to live the present     
but want to protect the unseen future!    
    
O Man, you do not believe     
in the certainty of the relationship     
and investing your life in building fragile things!    
    
Man who struggle in youth     
In search of love, happiness, shelter, job     
Thinks old age will be peaceful     
because there are insurance companies     
and children to take care of.    
    
To make these relationships more reliable     
we try to bring strong laws for insurers     
and high morality for humans.     
But even after that who can deny the suffering?    
    
If there is enjoyment     
then it is because someone is suffering.     
Or in a state of helplessness     
Human has learned to be happy at the suffering of others?    
    
Do you see a system or hope for a system     
where all have joy and well-being?    
    
In old age, people have a lot of diseases.     
In youths, people have a lot many health complications.     
Those who have money,     
make the hospital their permanent home.    
    
Sometimes in comma and     
sometimes in a semi-consciousness state     
Hoping to go home again     
live there in a good healthy state for ever.    
    
Life has become so much important     
That the word death is considered inauspicious     
People are investing in learning the art of living     
Even when they know birth happens only once     
And death is happening every moment,     
Thus, society think death is so much ugly, inauspicious     
and birth is beautiful!    
    
I remember in the olden time     
People use to go to Gaya or Kashi     
towards the end of their life     
And willing work to detach from the body     
And candidly one day choose not to enter the body     
Where that science has gone?    
    
Suicide is a state of helplessness     
Like birth and death is helplessness.    
    
But, if human learn the art of dying     
Then he automatically learns     
how to live meaningful every moment     
And how to exit gracefully and willingly,     
when there is a desire to change body     
and continue living in the new body.    
    
In this state of wisdom     
human knows there is     
no exit from the suffering created by Karma     
but there is an exit from the pain of worn and torn body.    
    
I have not met anybody     
who is happy with his/her body     
Some say I am too short, some I am too tall     
Some say my skin is too black, some it is too white     
Some say I am too fat, some say I am too thin     
Some say I have a heart problem, so say I have a bone problem     
Some say I have a gastric problem, some say I have BP problem.    
    
But if you tell them to leave this body to get the new     
They say, all your Gods, faith, Pooja, worship is non-sense.     
Don’t trick me, I have been fooled enough in this world.     
I will not leave this till get a new, better, fresh body for me.     
So we want to live again without dying in the first.    
    
O Wise one,     
You even don’t believe in your God?     
Or you are not convinced with your Karma of this life?     
Or you are an atheist?     
That is why you want a better body first     
Without exiting this one?    
    
But your God is smarter than you     
He thinks if He gives you a new body first     
Then there are chances you wanted     
to enjoy the wealth of the old body and     
disease-less perfect fresh new body     
and not willing to leave both!
