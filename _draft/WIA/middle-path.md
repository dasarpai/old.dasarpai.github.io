Middle path

We hear very commonly that don't go to extreme of anything in the life, walk the middle path, settle on middle ground, Madhya Maarga. However we notice how hard we try we cannot live on the middle path longer more we force to remain on the middle path life becomes more meaningless and boring.

When you are in the road how can you walk 1000 km journey on one lane and that too middle lane? What is the middle path of for sleeping, 6 hours per day? What is the middle path of working, learning, prayers, travelling, talking, reading, or any activity within life? If you pick a middle path and follow that everytime, everyday for 1 year then most of the people will find life has become boring, it looks we are in and following the fixed routine. Who want to live this kind of life?

The beauty of life know your own extremes and keep expending your extremes. There is no fun in traveling on middle path, but there is a wisdom in knowing how far away you are from the middle path. So middle path is good for knowing because it helps you knowing your own extremes but middle path is not good for living unless you want to make your life dry, monotonous, dull, colourless, vacuum, stale, barren, and tasteless.
