## Effect of Maya

    
    
If there is no object then the presence of light cannot be sensed.     
If there is no environment on earth then the blueness of the sky cannot be sensed.     
    
Human eyes and brain cannot see light     
in the absence of objects and environment.     
    
But still humans out of habit say that we can see light.     
This is the effect of Maya.    
    
For some time, clouds covered the sun.     
After sometime when you see the sun,     
you feel the sun has moved.     
But in reality earth has moved,     
cloud has moved and you have moved     
and the sun is at the same place.     
This is the effect of Maya.    
    
We know money can buy comfort and not the peace,     
We listen so and so rich couldn't     
enjoy his wealth and he passed away,     
Another rich lost everything     
he earned in life before he died.     
Still human helplessly and madly     
runs physical accumulations, comfort.     
This is the effect of Maya.    
    
Our own close friends, relatives and     
colleagues have rejected us     
And still when we are alone     
then either due to compassion     
or due to jealousy we think too much     
about all those who rejected us.     
This is the effect of Maya.    
    
Everyday we see husbands and wives are fighting each other     
Their children are suffering,    
They are going through trauma, rejection     
Still when people see opposite sex and get attracted     
They say we have fallen in love.    
Expecting something different will happen to them    
They get married and the same suffering repeats in their life.    
This is the effect of Maya.    
    
We see there are many people     
who are suffering because of children,    
Either children are not in good health     
or they are not well behaved,    
or they don't listen to their parents,    
or they don't care for family and social values,    
or does something which is heart wrenching for parents     
Still couples wants to have children     
Expecting something different will happen for them.    
This is the effect of Maya.
