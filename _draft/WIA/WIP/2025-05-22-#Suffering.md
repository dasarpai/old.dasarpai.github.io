Everyone has the power to Heal oneself, but still they suffer.
Few have the power to Heal others, they heal or not that is a matter of choice.
Extremely few experience Freedom, they do not suffer. They have freedom from miseries.

There are many ways and means of suffering in the world the best way is to remain ignorant of your true nature throughout your life.

If a human constantly remains aware of the purpose of his life and remains focussed then his entire energy goes in realizing that purpose. For such human, experience of suffering is not possible even if entire world is against that person.

It is truth that One cannot remain live without doing any Karma. But there is another truth that Karma binds and make humans slaves. The only way to live while doing Karma and not becoming a slave is to do the Karma with love, compassion, care, and respect.
