# What is Sin?

You lost loved one, lost relationship, lost money or health.
And you attribute it to God, Fate or Karma.
You feel consoled.
You attribute it to system, people and culture then you feel disgusting for these people, system and culture.

Whatever you attribute it you suffer further.
In reality you suffer because some things you don't know correctly.
So attributions are not helpful.

The truth is at present there is some unpleasant feeling in the mind and body.
The truth you have choice to control that.
The truth by controlling your mind you can control that suffering.

Unfortunately we learnt and earned everything in life which was less value but not this valuable thing called Dhyana. Therefore there is no end of our suffering.

Sin is not the cause of suffering.
We have chosen to suffer inspite having a free will that is the Sin.
And it is our free will to experience that we are not free.
Life is full of choices but because of our knowledge desires and vasanaas we feel are presented one option. Option to suffer.
