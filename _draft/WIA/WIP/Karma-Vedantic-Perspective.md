## What is Karma? 
We do the Karma to get something or gain something or enhance something or get rid of something or reduce something.

What is that which we want to gain and  enhance? That which brings pleasure or joy to our life.
What is that which we want to reduce or get rid of?  that which gives us the pain or suffering.

Generally be here people say that good Karma increases pleasure and joy and bad Karma brings pain and suffering.  But we need to understand first we do the Karma and then its result come. Shuddh challenge is at the time of doing Karma how do I know this Karma will bring joy and pleasure not the pain and suffering,  in other words we are interested in doing what is good Karma and what is bad Karma.

What is the definition of good and bad for you it it same throat your life changed over the period of time when you became more matured. If it has not change for you throughout your life then it means you are stuck to the moral code of conduct given in the books and description and you miss the life. But if you find it changed then ask yourself will it remain same for next 5 year 10 year or 20 years?

 the word could or bad is subjected and it is used to describe and adjectify the world around. That is extremely difficult to know the objective reality of the existence but whatever we describe is the subjective reality.  it means the word good and bad is very subjective.  in this situation how to find the Karma which I am doing or about to do is good Karma or bad Karma?

Is not doing a Karma also a Karma if yes then how?  Suppose you are my long time very good friend. One day I come to your home and over some discussion I slap you friendly for some reason. After this incident, your helper enter into our room bring coffee and snacks for me. But, I say I just have taken my breakfast 15 minute before, I will not eat and drink anything now.  And you tell me that why I have not told you that you have taken breakfast. We are meeting after so many years. Now you deserve a slap from me. If you could have told me I could have planned lunch with you.  now my not telling to you that I have taken a breakfast is a Karma or not? The result depends upon how do you take my refusal of accepting coffee and snacks. If it is karma then it is very difficult to say what is not Karma. 

Shloka below is from Bhagavad Gita 4.16.  and it tells Extremely difficult to know what is karma and with but akarma.  but but the Bhagwan Krishna says Karma Is that by knowing which you become free from  bad or inauspicious

किं कर्म किमकर्मेति कवयोऽप्यत्र मोहिता: |
तत्ते कर्म प्रवक्ष्यामि यज्ज्ञात्वा मोक्ष्यसेऽशुभात् || 4.16||
kiṁ karma kim akarmeti kavayo ’pyatra mohitāḥ
tat te karma pravakṣhyāmi yaj jñātvā mokṣhyase ’śhubhāt

## Karma Philosophy of Bhagavad Gita
Although there are two chapters dedicated for Karma in the Bhagavad Gita. Chapter 3 is Karma Yoga and Chapter 4 is Karma Sanyas Yoga. But there are many important noted slokas in the Bhagavad Gita which helps understanding Karma.

कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन ।
मा कर्मफलहेतुर्भूर्मा ते सङ्गोऽस्त्वकर्मणि ॥ 2.47 ॥
You have a right to perform your prescribed duty (Karma), but you have no rights (Adhikar) to the “fruits of action” (Karmfaleshu). Do not consider yourself the “cause of the results of your karma” (Karmafalahetu), and neither be attached to “not doer” (Akarmani).

What you do or don’t do is your right and your choice. What, where, and when you get the result is not your right. Because, the forces determine what, where, and when the result (karma fala) of Karma will be given. They are not in your control, and trying to exercise your right on this will cause many problems in your life.

कर्मजं बुद्धियुक्ता हि फलं त्यक्त्वा मनीषिणः ।
जन्मबन्धविनिर्मुक्ताः पदं गच्छन्त्यनामयम् ॥ 2.51 ॥
Manishi (sages) after dropping the results of those Karama, which arises due to attachment to karma has become free (Vinirmukta) from cycles of death and birth (Janmabandha). They reach that state and place, and after going there is no return.

It refers to the realization of Mukti (liberation), if one drops the attachment to the Karmafala.

यस्त्विन्द्रियाणि मनसा नियम्यारभतेऽर्जुन ।
कर्मेन्द्रियैः कर्मयोगमसक्तः स विशिष्यते ॥ 3.7 ॥
Oh Arjuna, a person, who starts controlling the Indriya [organs of sensory knowledge and organs of karma] with the help of Manas; this person’s organs of action (Karmaindriya) remain detached due to KarmaYoga. This person is special.

It refers to control over your sense organs (eyes, ears, tongue, etc.), plus your action organs (hands, feet, speech, etc.), with the help of your Mind.

अन्नाद्भ‍वन्ति भूतानि पर्जन्यादन्नसम्भवः ।
यज्ञा‍द्भ‍‍वति पर्जन्यो यज्ञः कर्मसमुद्भ‍वः ॥ 3.14 ॥
All living bodies subsist on food grains, which are produced from rain. Rains are produced by the performance of yajña [sacrifice], and yajña is born of Karma.

तस्मादसक्तः सततं कार्यं कर्म समाचर ।
असक्तो ह्याचरन्कर्म परमाप्‍नोति पूरूषः ॥ 3.19 ॥
Therefore, without being attached to the fruits of activities, one should act as a matter of duty, for by working without attachment one attains the Supreme.

प्रकृतेः क्रियमाणानि गुणैः कर्माणि सर्वशः ।
अहङ्कारविमूढात्मा कर्ताहमिति मन्यते ॥ 3.27 ॥
The spirit soul bewildered by the influence of false ego thinks himself the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by the three modes of material nature.

सन्न्यास: कर्मयोगश्च नि:श्रेयसकरावुभौ ।
तयोस्तु कर्मसन्न्यासात्कर्मयोगो विशिष्यते ॥ 5.2 ॥
The renunciation of work and work in devotion are both good for liberation. But, of the two, work in devotional service (Karma Yoga) is better than the renunciation of work.

युक्त: कर्मफलं त्यक्त्वा शान्तिमाप्‍नोति नैष्ठिकीम् ।
अयुक्त: कामकारेण फले सक्तो निबध्यते ॥ 5.12 ॥
The steadily devoted soul attains unadulterated peace because he offers the result of all activities to Me; whereas a person who is not in union with the Divine, who is greedy for the fruits of his labor, becomes entangled.

कायेन मनसा बुद्ध्या केवलैरिन्द्रियैरपि ।
योगिन: कर्म कुर्वन्ति सङ्गं त्यक्त्वात्म‍श‍ुद्धये ॥ 5.11 ॥
The yogīs, abandoning attachment, act with body, mind, intelligence, and even with the senses, only for the purpose of purification.
