# Solution of Inside problem is not outside

When you are mentally sick, feeling tired, defeated, exhausted, lonely, sad you know you are not liking this.

Who is that you, who don't like all this?

To solve this problem you take help of external agents, surrounding, environment. You want to listen music, watch some game, play some sports, talk with someone who can help, someone whom you love, watch laughter show or commedy show, go to party, drink alcohol and smoke something which temporarily stimulus your mind.

To solve these problems permanently we solutions like marriages or jobs or have children. But we know by the time we become old problems become more acute.

To solve internal problem you are taking help of external. This is bandage solution. It not a treatment.
