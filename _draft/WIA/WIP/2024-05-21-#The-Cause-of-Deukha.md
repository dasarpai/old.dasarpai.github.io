The function of Manas is to think, recall, and imagine. With Manas we have emotions. Due to these emotions, we have swings in mood, we feel good or bad. Mind never wants suffering, it always looks for pleasure i.e. Sukha. But the mind doesn't know whether a particular place, work, or person will give Sukha or Dukha. it always hopes for Sukha and keeps running. This is the way the mind is designed and it is perfectly fine.

Even after so much running and effort of Manas if  Manas experiences Dukha then the reason is not Manas but Buddhi. If Buddhi doesn't have Neer-Kshir Vivek and it keeps getting confused everytime, then it will not guide the Karma-Indriya and Jnyana Indriya and knowledge sense properly and it will lead to Dukkha.

Sometimes because of sanskar our mind seek for something but if intellect is able to guide properly and human has sankalp Shakti they can avoid suffering to a great extend. Some suffering will remain there because life is about suffering.
