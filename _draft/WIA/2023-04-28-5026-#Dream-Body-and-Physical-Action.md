# Dream Body and Physical Action 

Dream Body and Physical Action 

When you are travelling in a moving bus or train or plane, your body feels a strong need to urinate, you go to the right place, you urinate, come back to your seat and still feel the same pain in your stomach which you were before urination. It means you haven't urinated. Why because you are dreaming and you are young body and trained mind. Your body knows demand of urination is coming from dream body therefore body doesn't cooperate on the bed and avoids making mess which you in your childhood. But in childhood or weak body this not possible that you want to urinate you to he place you release urine and you feel relax.

In childhood it happens because mental and physical body is not trained. So they don't understand the difference between these two and even in dream act like they are acting in real world. In old age or too much sickness it happens because your body it too weak to communicate with others and handle itself. But you are aware what is happening.

Human has many desires, wishes which he want to fulfill before he dies. To fulfill those he runs throughout his life. By accident or by chance or by too much travel and exertion or some Guru's timely training when people realise this is dream then their physical and mental body coordination happens properly and they don't do all the things all the things at all places because they know this world is a hundred years long dream. So their waken consciousness don't co-operate with their physical body and mental/dream body. If there is too much pain or not fullfilling some desire they do some act like dreaming people turn a other side while sleeping and manage the situation but they never urinate in the body. You can manage this for sometime but one day you have to wake up. Otherwise other people around you will suffer too much around you because of your act. Of course they also suffer in their dream because in their dream you and your actions are real for them.

It is impossible to wake the entire humanity at once. We are any other animal on this planet just by reading books, having society and economy we never get the realisation that this is advance level of dream.

Like I am writing this message in dream and you are reading in another dream. Technology developed to communicate these messages developed in dream and we are using the technology in dream. Technology development was possible because some smart people observed this dream world so well they found some tricks to manage the so called physical objects around.

In reality physicality is our own creation in a field called space time. Consciousness is fundamental form which time space is projected. All the things around have some reality in space time but not that we we understand with our untrained dreamy mind. It is not that we haven't been trained. We have been trained a lot and know a lot but only about another kind of dream world called physicality is reality.
