## Reality And Relativity

    
Does color exists independent     
from human eyes sensation?     
Colour is nothing but a vibration of light radiation.     
These vibrations exist independently and     
received differently by different eyes     
depending on how good your eyes are.     
Thus the color which you perceive is not     
the same which really exists.    
    
Does size exists independent     
from human mind sensation?     
Different objects from atom to stars exist around us.     
But all perceived differently     
by the different human minds.     
In childhood, a cricket bat looks like a tree size big,     
our village looks like a planet     
but with time it changes.     
If we have a lemon and a football before us then     
everyone perceives the size difference differently.     
If you see the moon outside through a small hole     
then you will perceive the ratio of the size     
of the hole and size of the moon     
differently than others.     
Thus the size which you perceive is not     
the same which really exists.    
    
Does sound exists independent     
from human ear sensation?     
Sound is vibration it exists when air is present     
Whether you listen or not and     
what you listen is up to you.     
Meaning of same sound varies     
for different culture, societies, individual     
and it also depends upon the time     
when you listen to a sound.     
Thus the sound which you perceive is not     
the same which really exists.    
    
Does taste exists independent     
from human tongue sensation?     
Taste exists independently of the human tongue     
but not the way sound and light exist.     
Because sound and light exist as vibration     
but taste exists as the essence of the object.     
Flower, cotton, fruits, vegetables     
all have different essence and different chemicals     
therefore their taste exists separately.     
Thus the taste which you perceive is not     
the same which really exists.    
    
Does touch exists independent     
from human skin sensation?     
The softness or temperature of the surface     
exists independent from the human sense of touch.     
It doesn’t exist as vibration like sound and light     
Neither it exists like the taste,     
which is the essence of objects.     
But it exists like changeable essence.     
Surface of table, the temperature of bread or tea,     
smoothness of cloth is not perceived the same by all.     
It varies from time to time and person to person.     
Thus the touch which you perceive is not     
the same which really exists.    
    
Does smell exists independent    
    
from human nose sensation?    
    
Smell of a flower, cow dung,     
mud after the first rain of the season,     
samber, rice is not the same for everybody.     
Smell is the essence of the objects around     
but it travels in the air     
Neither it exists like vibration of sound and light.     
Nor it exists like the taste and touch     
which is the essence and unmovable from the object.     
Neither it is like touch     
which is the essence but changes with time.     
We know that a smell exists independently     
and is integral to the objects.     
Thus the smell which you perceive is not     
the same which really exists.    
    
What we perceive from our five senses and mind     
depends least upon essence     
and content of the objects     
and it depends most upon the essence     
and content of our own mind.    
    
O Chaitnya, if it is so, that the sensation     
which you perceive depends mostly upon     
the content of your own mind then     
why don’t you create a mind which     
can smell the jasmine in all objects,     
can see the self in all objects,     
can listen a music of your own soul from all objects,     
can taste the taste of your own tongue and     
can sense the softness which you feel     
when you fold your hands together?
