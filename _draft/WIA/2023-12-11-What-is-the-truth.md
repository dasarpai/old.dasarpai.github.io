# What is the Truth

Your son fails in 12th class exam or you get promoted in your job.    
One brings suffering and another brings happiness.


Some believe happiness is because of my karma    
and suffering is because of God.    
Because God is testing me.    
On top of that some believe God tests 
only a few strong, reliable people.  
They believe what is the use of testing those 
who are already weak, poor and broken.  
   
Some believe happiness is because of God's grace,    
suffering is because of my Karma.  
   
Some believe happiness and suffering 
both are because of my karma.  
   
Some believe happiness and suffering both because of God's wish.    
He wants us to bring closer to Him and for that    
He wants us to get results of our Karma, get exhausted and reach to him.  
   
Some believe happiness and suffering is neither because of God nor because of Karma.    
Because they don't exist.    
It is our own mental imagination    
we can impose happy happiness or suffering on any event.    
It has nothing to do with reality but pure mental phenomenon.  
   
Religious books say all kinds of things.    
People say all kinds of things. What is the reality?  
   
The knower of the Truth is silent but    
Other are speaking their believe all over the city,    
They do not know the reality.  
   
Perhaps calm, silent, introvert, meditative mind knows the truth    
but she/he will not speak till    
you don't have the ability to experience what is being said.    
But the moment you have that ability    
you don't feel like listening and speaking with the world.    
You are full of yourself. You know the truth.
