## Who Killed Tantra

    
Tantra means system. (like Lok-Tantra, Praja-Tantra etc)     
Mantra means sound which contains secret, powerful energy.     
Yantra means tool.    
    
Indian Tantra school     
(a school that uses a system or collection of systems)     
helps in creating tools (Yantra).     
This yantra may be of Devi (female),     
Devta (female) yantra.     
Theoretically, I believe it is possible     
to create neutral Yantra as well.    
    
But the purpose is     
to use tool for some genuine     
good purpose and solve complex problems.    
    
You do not use JCB crane to lift a pen.     
Without a tool, you can lift that using your hand.    
    
Neither the purpose is     
to keep praising, cleaning, or sharpening     
or offering flowers to Yantra.     
Yantra (Tool) is meant to achieve some goal.    
    
Being a subjective Yantra     
you need to maintain a personal     
and emotional relationship with the Yantra     
that is why daily Pooja etc     
is necessary but that is not the goal.     
Not surrendering to Yantra is the goal.     
And logically this act cannot give     
you any results as well.    
    
Tantra or Systems primarily come     
from Shaivites, Vaishnavites, and Shakta schools.    
    
I fail to understand     
why this beautiful science is killed     
systematic in the last 100 years     
and we have moved into western systems of one God,     
many gods, mass prayer, mass meditation, mass service etc.     
These may be good political tools to unite     
the people and rule the nation     
but definitely not what our ancestors have given to us.    
    
Political responses to public Namaz, Sunday masses     
can we Public Ramlila, Public Hanuman Chalisa etc.     
But this is not our original system,     
This is the response to political threats.    
    
The most unfortunate part of this is,     
many who claim to know this science     
are either fraud or ill minded people.     
On top of that western-educated     
media reporters, editors, debaters,     
and commentators bring it further down.    
    
In the public domain science means physical sciences     
but what about these sciences     
which has been part of culture and traditions?    
    
Without all this what god or goddess     
we are praying and to whom we are fooling     
by following western traditions?    
    
Are we trapped in politics?     
Are we trapped in race and competition with westerners?     
Have we become mindless     
who is not able to understand what is happening around us?     
Or we are so naive that anybody can fool us?    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Yours Truly Hari
