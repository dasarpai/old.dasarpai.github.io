# Sign of Wisdom

Your surroundings are made of people, lives, the government and systems around you.
Which consists of family members, office hierarchy, political setup, religious teachings, elders, younger, colleagues, even others life like pet, other'e pet, animals around.

Your relationship with the surroundings also depends upon the surroundings. You are not 100% responsible to create a smooth responsible. Some people are good but hostile towards you, some people are hostile by their own nature, if you try to change them without their will you will waste your life, time and energy. Changing the system, religious beliefs and government around is an extremely difficult task. In human civilization those who could change it didn't change it by changing others but by changing the self.

Your relationship with yourself 100% depends upon yourself. If you want even God cannot alter it then what to say about surroundings.

When we say relationship with self it means how we keep ourselves mentally, physically, emotionally and intellectually. 

If you blame others for poor relationship with them it is understandable that the surroundings may be uncooperative.

If you blame others for your poor relationship with yourself then you are not wise. The greatest sign of wisdom is can yourself joyful, healthy, peaceful, settled even in the most hostile environment where entire surrounding is against you and you are unaffected like a water drop on lotus leaf.
