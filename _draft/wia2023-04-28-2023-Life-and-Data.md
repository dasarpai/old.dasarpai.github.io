# Life and Data

Data is about life and existence. Everything which exists or has life has corresponding data. But if there is no human who bother about the data then what happens to data? For example when there is no human but all kind of animals and birds then what happens to data? Is it there or not?

Data is about language, text numbers, alphabets. Every human language has different way of writing and speaking about those. But object apple with human is pure reality without data. But when human come with its language, vocabulary, grammar, script then data comes in existence. Without human earth, sun and moon is rotating, and moving in the space, fishes are dancing in the water, plants are growing and flowers are blossoming but there is no poetry no English or Hindi or Chinese languages. 

What is that which helps plants growing can a seed become tree without having having any data, information and intelligence inside the seed? No matter what dog eat that food will not make him cat or mouse so what that data, information or intelligence inside the dog which remembers how to process the food? How come number of carbon atom has 6 proton and 6 Neutron in the nucleus? Why don't it has 6 proton and 21 Neutron? What is that intelligence which ensures this system or symmetry of existence remain there. If you start looking every human mind has data is completely different from the existence around. No two human has same data about a particular thing around, no matter how standardization of education and language we do. If start looking deeper you will find data become information for intelligent life around, information can become wisdom and intelligence. But if there is no intelligence then data can never become intelligence. So what is that intelligence which remembers colour of blood cell, colour of flower, atomic structure of an atom and molecular structure of a protein? I am not talking about the colour which human see or structure which human describe. I am taking about that vibration at which flowers emits due to which human perceive some colour, I am talking about that structure which carries the life on an atom, molecules or shape and size of a tree in a consistent way !


If it is there in the animal's mind because without the data about the environment they cannot even arrange food for themselves.

If it is there then is it the same data which human has about his surroundings?

If there is one Apple on the table then do two people have same data in their mind about this apple? If not then it is clear that reality can never be perceived!

For example a photo of living entity is data, recorded sound of living entity is data, smell coming from a living
