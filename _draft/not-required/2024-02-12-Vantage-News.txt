Sharma the biggest story tonight comes from Pakistan the Army has lost the election
usually countries of armies in Pakistan the Army has a country and this is an army that has never won a war and never
lost an election but this time there was an anti-climax Naas Sharif has just
declared himself the winner the single largest party at least that's what he says but it doesn't really matter people
in Pakistan have voted against the Army there are reports of protests in many parts of the country after widespread
reports of rigging what will this election mean for Pakistan India and the world more risk
more uncertainty we'll discuss all of that and speaking of risk Sam Alman The Man Behind Chad GPT is betting big again

Muslim League noon is the largest single party in the country today
clear your calendar grab some popcorn and Buckle in because this weekend is going to be Rocky Pakistan's election
has just delivered the mother of all surprises of googly for the ages and at
the receiving end is the Army a seasoned batter who seen it all so who will prevail in this high
stakes contest let's look at the score line first Naas sharif's Pakistan Muslim
League is at 43 seats the bhos PPP at 28
and now for the big surprise candidates backed by Imran Khan at 57 Pakistan's National Assembly has 266
seats so to form for a government you need 134 and Imran Khan is in poll
position but Naas Sharif doesn't seem to care he visited his party headquarters a short while back and Sharif says he has
won this election Muslim League noon is the largest single
party in the country today after the elections
how about that his party is trailing but Naas Sharif says he has won the election
well that's Pakistani politics for you Naas sharif's plan is to build a coalition he says he will reach out to other parties but why is he celebrating
prematurely what exactly happened in the last 24 hours Let's recap voting in
Pakistan ended at 5:00 p.m. local time yesterday then the drama began
Pakistan's Election Commission began counting the votes most of us had the same expectation an easy victory for
nawas Sharie after all the Army had played every dirty trick Imran Khan was in jail
his party had lost its election symbol the bat it it top leaders were intimidated so what could possibly go
wrong well late Into the Night results started trickling in and what did they show Imran Khan's candidates in the lead
most of them had contested as Independents and yet they were leading some Trend showed Imran Khan's
party the PTI crossing the majority and that too comfortably it is quite apparent to know
that Pakistan Tarik insaf is deing on 125 seats by huge margins uh that means
in due course of time we shall be in a position to form governments at the center and in at least two provinces two
of the four provinces the other side was in disarray Naas Sharif himself was trailing from
his seat most of his party leaders were nowhere to be seen in contrast Imran Khan's PTI hit the streets their
supporters rallied outside polling stations they refused to leave until counting was
done from the Electoral symbol bat was withdrawn our leader Imran Khan was jailed PTI
supporters were given a message that you cannot win but still PTI supporters did not lose heart the result of today's
polling will be all in our favor the P supporters young
youth if a leader is in jail we are his Lions outside and we will fight until a lion is out of jail and we want Imran
Khan to be out of jail as soon as possible and inshallah we will still win
so everyone began asking the same question had pakistanis beaten the Army
was Ral pendy script unraveling well it was too early to say once the early Trends emerged a few
suspicious things happened first of all the election commission's website went down people could not access it anymore
then the counting slowed down suddenly results were simply not being published then at 3:00 a.m. local time the
election commission called a press conference in the thick of the night 3 a. a.m. after all all of this you would
think that the chief election commissioner would show up at least give an explanation for what was happening
well think again another election official addressed this presser and he made two important announcements one the
delay was because of the internet Pakistan had snapped mobile services on voting day apparently that was slowing
things down and announcement number two the early Trends were unverified meaning
the pti's lead may not have been real that's what the election commission offic said now obviously this sounds
fishy because yesterday the election commission said something very different they said the internet shutdown would
not affect counting so what changed in a few hours
only they can tell us but afterwards we saw some worrying pictures soldiers deployed outside counting centers
soldiers pushing away PTI workers even some footage of ballot stuffing multiple
journalists and activists have posted these pictures and videos but we cannot vouch for their authenticity 
which brings us to today counting speed has improved compared to yesterday but
still still the pace is slow Pakistan's homegrown result transmission system is not working so the result results are
being relayed physically which means rigging is easier the PTI has pointed
out several examples take a look at this document it shows results from a constituency in lore the winner is nawas
Sharif but now look at the numbers and listen to this carefully around 293,000 votes were cast
293,000 and how many were counted 294,000
so where did these extra thousand votes come from it looks like a classic case
of rigging and I must say a poorly executed one but even rigging can only help so
much because nawas Sharif actually lost his other seat he was contesting from two constituencies one was in Lor the
other was in hiber pakun thanks to Magic numbers he won in lore but the other
seat he lost reminds me of something he said on the campaign Trail listen to
this I love you I love you too if you love me na Shar also loves you Pakistani
voters have given the answer they do not love Naas Sharif not like they used to
he now represents a politics of the old a politics that young Pakistan does not identify with many voters have openly called out the rigging pass
well it's not game over yet the results still show Imran Khan in the lead but the sharifs are not giving up Mariam
nawas says her party the Muslim League will be the single largest party she says Naas Sharif will give a victory
speech once the results are in he's already spoken he says theirs is the single largest party so did the tide
change overnight the Bel seem to think so but don't expect this drama to end with the
results just think about it early Trend showed the PTI forming a government but 24 hours later they could
lose how would you react to that if you're an Imran Khan supporter you would be outraged and by the looks of it
Pakistan has many of those so this election drama is not ending anytime soon in fact it's unlocked a new crisis
now what does this mean for Pakistan and the world more uncertainty for sure but that's not all this election changes
many Dynamics both within Pakistan and outside we look at the three biggest takeaways what should you make of this
election and the result in Pakistan number one Pakistan's Army has failed at least for the time being look at
everything that they did for nawas Sharif got his cases dismissed brought him back from London put his chief rival
in jail delayed the vote to help him campaign and yet the public sentiment was against them let's be clear about
that the final results May tell a different story but this was a vote against the Pakistan Army against its
meddling in politics and that spoils Ral pin's calculations because this election was supposed to be a clean slate a
chance to move Beyond Imran Khan but now Pakistan is back to square one PTI supporters are organizing
rallies and protests cases have been filed against 30 of them in Islam and chances are this number will increase so
the polls have plunged Pakistan into more crisis they've busted the Army's Aura of invincibility takeaway number two the
election has shown the power of technology in polls especially artificial intelligence Imran Khan was
arrested in August last year meaning he could not campaign his party was also barred from holding rallies and
Pakistani media was banned from giving him air time now normally that would kill a political
party but not the PTI because they turned to technology Imran Khan used AI
to deliver speeches they used deep fake his party held online rallies they overcame
physical restrictions with a digital Outreach in fact their social media game was on point the PTI has more than 9.8
million followers on X the Pakistan Muslim League Naas sharif's party has
just 2 and a half million and it's pretty active Ive too whether it's posting videos from polling stations or
reaction videos from leaders or even foreign media analysis the pti's online campaign was very
genz and it could be a template for other leaders in countries and finally take away number three the external
Dynamics what does this election mean for India and the world well it's a
tough one for starters Pakistan is a nuclear power it is also home to multiple Terror groups the world's
Terror headquarters if you will and it's on the brink its economy so
instability here is worrying that's the biggest concern for Western countries that's also why they keep backing the
Army to make sure that the nukes are safe but this election will put the West in a tough spot on the one hand the Army
is their is their Ally on the other hand the rigging is blatant so what will Western countries
do the United States has not criticized the internet shutdown it says it was
tracking the curbs whatever that means we are concerned about the
restrictions on the exercise of freedom of expression uh we are tracking reports of restrictions on internet and cell
phone access across Pakistan on polling day uh and we along with the International Community will continue to emphasize the importance of democratic
institutions a free press a vibrant civil society and expanded opportunities for political participation of all of uh
Pakistan's uh citizens but um I'm not going to get ahead of any of the other
uh official election results so I'm not going to comment on this any further well let's hope this is a wakeup call
for them Western countries have long been guilty of backing Pakistan they've armed Pakistan's Army bailed out the
government every time it's messed up and ignored their support for terrorism
maybe now is a time to shut the tab to realize what western money is used for
in Pakistan it doesn't reach the people for sure instead it is used to enrich the Army to crack down on voters and
subvert democracy will the US impose sanctions on Islamabad for this I wouldn't count
on it the Americans forget democracy when it comes to Pakistan just think back to the elections in Bangladesh last
month do you remember the pressure from Washington the scathing criticism but with Pakistan it's all
very businesslike so Western capitals need to take a hard look at their policy because
the current one is wrong in India too needs to be on alert
a clean slate may have triggered hopes of a reset but now all bets are off Pakistan's Army looks weak and
cornered that also makes them more dangerous we also can't rule out
domestic unrest Imran Khan's party is not the only one complaining of rigging most opposition parties feel
robbed what if they hit the streets and protest what if Terror groups capitalize on the unrest these are all real
possibilities of course there is nothing that India can do about it the only option is to wait and watch and be on your
guard now let's talk about Sam Alman the face of the global AI revolution in
November Alman was Front Page News he'd been unceremoniously sagged from open AI
a company that he created within weeks he made a comeback
the entire Saga was like a Hollywood Blockbuster there was corporate backstabbing the board of open AI had
turned on Altman his departure led to a companywide rebellion corporate giant Microsoft that made a power play they
offered a job to Sam Alman and practically everyone at open AI who wanted to leave soon Sam Alman Rose Like
a Phoenix From the Ashes within days of his sacking he was reinstated as the CEO of open Ai and the shakeup only made him
stronger it was quite the story he's now the Undisputed champion of the global AI Revolution and with his new found
superpowers he's gearing up to make his next big bet a $7 trillion bet on chips
with a potential to to shake up the global semiconductor Market the future of Technologies chips
and AI the problem is there aren't enough of them Alman wants to fix that by expanding production you see apps
like chat GPT run on special chips and here's how they work imagine
an office is full of large stacks of paper you're the manager you need to sort out all these documents you're
looking for something specific and you must find it quickly so you get a bunch of interns to sort out your stuff
they're Keen but they lack experience they take a lot of time and sifting through the papers but you don't have
that kind of time so you get more people to do the job this time experienced ones those who've done it before and they
prove to be more efficient and that's exactly how AI apps like chat GPT work
work chips are like the workers in office some can do a basic job and deliver slowly some have advanced skills
and act faster some chips are designed just for AI they're called
gpus graphic processing units gpus think of them as your experienced hands
they're more efficient and the more such chips you have the better and faster you
can deliver you can sort through more data quickly you can reach more customers and that's the goal that Sam
Al is chasing if you cannot buy more such chips make them yourself that's the idea
right now Nvidia has a monopoly in the AI chip game we told you about this company yesterday last year in September
Nvidia had 80% of the market share 80 80% of the market share now Sam Alman
wants a slice of this pie in fact he wants to reshape the entire Market the plan is bold and
ambitious last year Global chip sales stood at over $500 billion by 2030
they're expected to touch $1 trillion Alman wants to raise 5 to7 trillion for
for his chip Venture so the proposed investment is seven times bigger than what the market
is expected to be where will this money be spent to ramp up manufacturing and build
infrastructure Alman is basically proposing a partnership he wants to bring together the top stakeholders in
this space the chip makers the investors and and those who can power such factories he wants to work with all of
them and what will be his role Reports say he wants to be an investor he'll offer money and set up the funds to
build the factories and the Chip foundaries And once these facilities are ready the chip makers can run
them now for this he's looking to mobilize trillions but where will the money come
from apparently there are potential investors Sam mman is said to have pitched the idea to the government of
the UAE to to masayoshi son who's the CEO of soft bank and to tsmc the Taiwan
semiconductor Manufacturing Company it's the world's biggest chipmaker the ask is for $7
trillion let's put that figure in in perspective Microsoft is the main investor in open aai also the world's
biggest tech company Microsoft is worth over $3 trillion Apple comes second worth over
$2.9 trillion so together Microsoft and apple are worth around $6 trillion Sam
Alman is asking for 7 trillion it is a fact that entrepreneurs
thrive on taking risks and there are no rules on how big is too big as of today this looks like a Visionary
project from a future opportunity to A Present Danger let's talk about Myanmar
the kit neighbor of India now in the grip of violence the military hunai is in trouble it is losing ground and the
faith of its neighbors first it was China that cut its losses now it's India that's being forced to take some tough
calls an Indian project in Myanmar has come to a grinding halt we're talking about kaladan a major undertaking aimed
at improving India's connectivity with southeast Asia kaladan was supposed to connect
India's Kolkata port with Myanmar sway Port this is in the rakine state of Myanmar sway but in recent days progress
has St Reports say rebels in Myanmar have captured a town called Peta this is
a Border Town near the Indian state of mizoram the kaladan project runs through this town according to one lawmaker in
Myanmar the project is now quote unquote almost dead the Army has lost control in this
area Rebels are in charge of all major towns and supply routes and they're set to be gaining ground in
rakine so it's only a matter of time before they capture the entire state
they have surrounded the port of siwe and attacked myanmar's Navy there the
kaladan project was supposed to connect to this sway Port so clearly it is in
trouble and India has been watching these developments closely this week New Delhi issued an advisory it said the
situation in rakine is deteriorating Indians in the state should leave and those who plan to go there should
not yesterday another announcement was made India's CR the free movement
regime the free movement of people between India and Myanmar it was crabbed it was signed in 2018 for the benefit of
families living on both sides of the Border it allowed cross border movement up to 16 kmet in either country without
a Visa so if you lived in Myanmar you could get a one-year border pass you
could cross over to India and stay here for 2 weeks at a stretch the free movement regime also
improved access to educ ation and Healthcare Plus it encouraged crossborder trade but given the
volatility in Myanmar India is crapping it it also plans to fence the entire
border it's 1600 km long the India Myanmar border, 1600 km New Delhi wants
to fence it what does it mean for Myanmar people who want to come to India
will have to get a Visa now no exceptions those who try to cross over without a Visa will be treated as
illegal immigrants and this was needed as a lot of people have been pouring into to the
to the Indian side since last year India has sent back more than 200 soldiers from Myanmar they were attacked by
rebels so they came to India to seek Refuge now this is an influx that New Delhi does not
want Myanmar is unraveling it poses a security threat not just to India but
also to Bangladesh and other neighbor recently Rebels seized an outpost on the Bangladesh Myanmar
border when they struck myanmar's Border guard force was on duty they could not
withstand the rebels we're talking about 60 border guards here all of them
fled they were seen running towards the Bangladesh border did the guards cross into
Bangladesh we don't know yet what we can tell you is that Bangladesh too has height in
security Bangladesh and Myanmar share a border that is 270 km
long just like new Del dhar too is worried the fighting in Myanmar is now spilling over in all
directions.

 now let's talk about a frozen conflict the war in Ukraine president zilinski is in a difficult position his
military campaign is failing to deliver Western Aid is drying up and Ukraine's counter offensive has hit a dead end so
zilinski is trying to shake things up yesterday he sacked his army Chief and appointed Ed a battle hardened General
in his place this is the biggest change in Ukraine's military leadership since the war with Russia began in
2022 but will a change of God be enough to revive kev's campaign our next report
explores a handshake is often a symbol of camaraderie but in this picture it
indicates the end of a period marked by tension the person on the right is
General Zi until recently he led Ukraine's Armed Forces but this week he's leaving the
job a war is perhaps the worst time for a military shakeup but for zilinski a
change had become necessary there was growing friction between him and the general zi was increasingly at odds with
the president writing for The Economist last year zalu had admitted the war with Russia had reached a stalemate
zelinsky's office disagreed the president's team declared such commentary only benefits Russia but zi
refused to be held back within weeks after this interview his differences with zalinski became more apparent zi
wanted a mass mobilization he wanted another 500,000 soldiers to be
drafted zilinsky disagreed in recent days the two leaders only grew further
apart the general took his complaints public in December zi gave a press
conference where he declared that he was unhappy with the way soldiers were being
drafted as for the local draft offices as of now Frankly Speaking I'm not
currently satisfied with the work of the draft officers if I was satisfied with the work we would not discuss this bill
right now the the general was talking about a proposed law to reform the Army draft program the criticism was damaging
for zeni zi became a household name and a national hero for fighting the
Russians he was an inspiring Commander for his troops despite the stalled counter offensive Ukrainian showed more
faith in zi according to a recent opinion poll zi was more popular than
zilinski despite that the president sacked the general he believes Ukraine needs a new approach and a different direction under a different
generaly tens of generals are being considered for leadership positions in the army and will serve under the
leadership of the most experienced Ukrainian Commander a true Battlefield Commander Colonel General Alexander cki
he has successful defense experience he conducted the KF defense operation he also has successful offensive experience
The kave Liberation operation I appointed Colonel General Siri as the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces
of Ukraine syi has led Ukraine's Ground Forces since 2019 he has a reputation of
being an obsessive planner when Russia invaded Ukraine syki successfully
defended Kev he also pushed the Russian forces away from karv as he charts the
future for Ukraine's military syi has his work cut out breaking the Russian
defenses is just one part of his mission sirki also needs to fill in the big shoes of his
predecessor is Joe Biden unfit to be president it's a question we do not like
asking after all age is just a number we would much rather judge Biden on his policies but the president is not
helping his case recently Biden was investigated by a special Council the case dates back to the last decade Biden
was suspected of mishandling secret documents and what did the probe find
that Biden was guilty he mishandled the documents but that's not the biggest
headline from this probe report that would be this Biden's memory has has significant limitations it's apparently
hazy poor and painfully slow that's what the special Council
said now full disclosure this council is a republican so he had reasons to trash
Biden's memory but his findings are still concerning apparently Joe Biden did not remember when he was vice
president he also couldn't remember when his son died and that last claim really
riled up Biden the president was visibly agitated by it listen to this there's even reference that I don't
remember when my son died how in the hell dare he raise
that frankly when I was asked the question I thought to myself wasn't any of their damn business my memory is not
my memory is fine my memory take a look at what I've done since I become president so Biden says his memory is
fine but moments later he messed up he was talking about Aid passing from Egypt
to Gaza but he got confused between the presidents of Mexico and Egypt as you
know initially the president of Mexico CCE did not want to open up the gate to
allow humanitarian material to get in I talked to him I convinced to open the
gate just to clarify LCC is the President of Egypt Andre Manuel obor is
the president of Mexico it's not the first time that Biden has got confused he's making a
habit of it on Sunday Biden got the French president's name wrong he called him miton instead of maon then on
Wednesday he made another Gaff he confused Angela Merkel with Helmut Cole
both were German chancellors but Biden only dealt with one of them and that was Merkel these mixups have raised
questions about Biden's abilities is he fit to be in office let alone run again
the Republicans of course don't think so chances are they will weaponize this report it confirms what they have been saying
for a while that Joe Biden is mentally unfit but is Donald Trump any better he
too has confused names recently Trump was talking about his response to the capital riots he confused Nancy Pelosi
for Nikki Haley Nikki Haley you know they did you know they destroyed all of
the information all of the evidence everything deleted and destroyed all of it all of it because of lots of things
like Nikki Haley is in charge of security we offered her 10,000 people
soldiers National Guard so whatever they want they turned it down guess who's capitalizing on this
Nikki Haley she has released a new campaign advertisement it Brands Trump and Biden as Grumpy Old Men as I may
call it a cheap shot but age has become a key issue in this election Joe Biden is 81 years old Donald Trump is 77 years
old compare that to the average age of US presidents just 50 5 years so the concerns are real around 76% voters are
concerned about Biden's age 48% think Trump is too old to be
president so both men face the same criticism but is it a fair criticism
that's where the debate gets fuzzy presidents are public servants at the end of the day so technically they're
hired by the people so why can't people demand younger presidents employers do
it all the time in the current atmosphere it makes a lot of sense the US is involved in two Wars it is also
facing challenges from China so now is the time for young charismatic
leadership but who do they get two old white men and it's not just about their age
it's about their mental capacity mixing up names of younger your counterparts is funny the first time but by the third
time eyebrows are raised and that's what's happening now having said that there is a a silver lining for both men
in the final race they can debate each other instead of a younger more energetic candidate that would have made
the difference more Stark luckily for them it's old versus
old speaking of Aging here's a fun fact before the end of this Century the world population will shrink for the first
time since the Bubonic plague of the 1300s not because of an increase in debts but because of a slump in births
across the world fertility rate is collapsing in the year 2000 it stood at 2.7 births per woman today it is 2.3 and
countries are worried including France France has asked 25 yearolds to get
fertility checks this has invited massive backlash meanwhile Singapore wants people to
celebrate the year of the dragon by having quote unquote Little Dragons of their own that's what they're calling
babies to make the concept more interesting perhaps but will these tactics work here's a
report France has a baby problem its birth rate has been in Decline for a decade now but in 2023 it was down by 7%
from the previous year France's current fertility rate is at 1.7 children per
woman that's much lower than 2.1 which is the ideal fertility rate to have healthy population replacement and now
France is panicking but president Emanuel macron has a new plan what he calls demographic
rearmament following the extension of paternity leave I really believe in establishing a new child care leave
which will replace the current parental leave first of all it will be better paid and it will allow both parents to
be with their child for six months if they wish but that's not all macron also
wants fertility testing done for those aged 25 and the French are not taking
this well critics say he has made people's bodies a part of the national plan that this is an offensive intrusion
especially as the number of people who start planning to have children at 25 is extremely low the average age at which
French women give birth is 31 France wants to impose tests instead of understanding why the birth rate is
declining so macron is on the receiving end of a massive backlash but France
isn't the only one faing this plight Singapore has a similar problem in 2022
Singapore's fertility rate fell to a record low of 1.04 last year it Rose to 1.17 which is
progress but still kept Singapore in the worst three fertility rates in the world after Taiwan and South Korea now
Singaporean prime minister lisian L has urged families to have more children this year he encouraged the people in
his Luna New Year address this being the Year of the Dragon L asked young couples to welcome Little Dragons into their
families cute words of encouragement but they may not be enough to solve the problem after all many countries are in
the same boat America Italy Spain China Japan across the world countries are
facing a big baby problem they don't have enough they've tried throwing money at the problem Taiwan has spent more
than $3 billion trying to get its citizens to have more children yet it has the lowest fertility rate in the
world they've tried strange words of encouragement Russia has asked women to
have eight or more children and it's not working either many of the countries such as
China uh Japan uh Singapore Taiwan they have been trying various things to have
a higher growth rate in population primarily this has been to financial
incentives for having children but we are also seeing that they have not been
as effective experts say throwing money at the problem won't cut it neither would
Hollow words people need affordable child care and housing more jobs
Innovative policies like affordable freezing of eggs if it's not financially
and emotionally feasible to have babies the birth rate won't increase and until
then hoping that the birth rate will improve is as Fantastical a thought as hoping for dragon
babies two years ago a child was abandoned in Mumbai that's India's Financial
Capital this three-year-old boy was found by the police he was sent to an orphanage 5 months later he was adopted
by a family this should have been a happy ending but it wasn't the adoptive
parents were dissatisfied they started complaining about the boy claiming that he was badly behaved and they could not
bond with him so last year they filed a petition in court they wanted to return
the child this week their wish came true the Bombay High Court annuled the adoption
and within a year this child was abandoned twice this story may be shocking but
it's not unique it happens all the time thousands of children are successfully adopted each year and a number of these
cases end in Failure adoptive families cannot cope and they return the child
between 2014 and 2019 more than 1,000 adopted children were returned in India
the highest number was seen in 2015 when about 9% of all adopted children were
returned but on average 4% of Indian adoptions are dissolved every year these
numbers are jarring but they're not limited to India in America up to 5% adopted children are returned each year
in the UK up to 9% adoptions fail annually
putting a child up for read-option is fairly common but legally speaking adopted children are no different from
biological children legally and for this reason returning an adopted child is
just as legally complicated as giving up a biological child different countries have different
mechanisms for this in India if a child has been adopted officially the matter of return lies with the
court they get to decide if the child can be returned it's a long winding
process it differs from case to case but one thing is common the family suffers
and of course the child's life is deeply disrupted The Experience leaves children
with significant trauma and with lifelong doubts and
concerns but apart from the emotional consequences what happens to those children whose adoptive parents no
longer want them in an ideal situation children are are sent back to the orphanage with a
second chance at adoption coupled with hopes for a better outcome but our world
is not an ideal Place Reports say many children are temporarily benched they're removed from the
adoption list until they can prove their preparedness
again Reports say only 0.04% of returned children are adopted
again but many adoptive parents are so desperate to return the child they don't want to take the legal
route and that's where the problem gets much worse in 2010 an American woman adopted
a 7-year-old boy from a Russian orphanage but soon she put the child
alone on a plane back to Moscow with only a note claiming that he was
mentally unstable the case caused International outrage now put internet in the this mix
and this is the result unwanted adopted children are being traded online in an
underground Network and adoptive parents are putting up Facebook ads to rehome children on their
own so adoption dissolution is complex but the big question is why are so many
adopted children sent back they tend to face a range of problems including behavioral issues
past trauma educational problems disabilities which is why differently abled and older children are sent back
the most in India children above 8 years of age face the biggest risk of this a
lot of times the institutions can be at fault adopters have accused organizations of omitting details about
children sometimes children are not counseled about what it would be like to live with a family they don't know most
parents are not prepared to address these problems and some don't even want to
despite this blame game one thing is quite clear this system of adoption is flawed It suffers from a Cavalier
culture of disposability where a child is either
either ends up with a blessing or loses another set of parents there is no in
between it's both unfortunate and
dangerous our last story tonight is about Taylor Swift if you haven't been living under a rock you must have heard
about her she's an American pop star a pop culture phenomenon Taylor Swift is lifting economies and causing
earthquakes colleges are teaching about her and Joe Biden wants an endorsement from her for 2024 it shows you how big
she is but with great Fame comes great criticism especially when you're a woman
Taylor Swift may be loved across the globe but she's always under great scrutiny and you can't dismiss it as a
