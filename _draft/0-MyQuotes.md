## Quotation001     
Life and God 
     
For some, God is Life.     
So they defend their God     
at the cost of their individual life.     
     
For others, Life is God.     
So they respect life much that     
they don't care about other gods than life.     
     
For some, there is no God.     
So they are busy with their own     
little activities to sustain their life.     
     
For others, there is no Life.     
So they are fed up with work,     
relationship, responsibilities     
that they feel they're breathing but they are dead.     
     
## Quotation002     
Pursuing Realty in Dream

Pursuing Realty in Dream 
or chasing unreal things in the Waking state.

When you are really thirsty and you're sleeping.     
That time a dream of drinking water can help you temporarily.     
But if you want a permanent solution then the dream must break     
So that, you can take some real water.     
     
In waking life also, we are chasing some unreal things,     
We can waste our whole life, and we won't get that.     
A pearl of wisdom is without wasting time,     
we should wake up and know what is real and what not.     
     
So move out of the dream of expecting unreal things.     
Alas, for most of the humanity,     
This day comes when they breathe last.     
     
## Quotation003     
Do not get hooked on the words 

Buddha says Samadhi is an absence of Dukkha     
Shankra says Samadhi is the presence of absolute bliss     
One is using a negative word to define something     
and another is using positive words.     
So don't get trapped too much     
around the negativeness or positiveness of words.     
Pay attention to the content.     
     
Negative words can have a meaningful message.     
And positive words may be like a hollow drum, without any weight or meaning.     
But for that one needs to learn how to live life neutral from the words of positive and negative, and need not be emotional with words.     
     
     
## Quotation004     
Falling in Love 

When people fall in love,     
They don't know how to raise their consciousness and come out of it. So, most people keep falling for their whole life.     

Some learn quickly and they rise in love.     
     
## Quotation005     
Mind is illness 
     
If the mind is ill then the illness can be treated,     
but if the mind itself is the illness,     
then this illness cannot be treated.     
It can be transcended, but it cannot be treated. 

- Osho     
     
## Quotation006     
Immortality beyond Graveyard
     
Every life, being, and the thing     
which has come into existence     
will fade away and die one day.     
     
But only human beings     
have the potential to know that     
there is some immortality     
in this graveyard called earth.     
     
Before you exit this planet     
work to experience that immortality     
or at least know that,     
This is also a possibility in your life.     
     
## Quotation007     
Looking into Eyes 
     
In love can you look straight     
and stare into another’s eyes     
You are giving energy to each other through your eyes.     
It is a virtuous loop.     
     
At other times you can offend a person.     
And each one is sucking the energy from others     
And this becomes a vicious loop.     
     
## Quotation008     
Do not Kill your Body  

One big difference between Artificial Intelligence (AI)     
and Natural Intelligence (NI) is     
If you don't use an AI system     
for a couple of months, then nothing will happen.     
But if you don't use an NI system     
for a couple of months, it will become dull and lazy.     
     
It is true about the human body and mind     
that no matter whether you have     
to go to work for making your living,     
or you don't have to go     
if you are interested in staying healthy till your last breath     
then use your physical body and gray cells of the brain     
and stress them every day in challenging situations.     
Pumping them with all kinds of food and     
Entertainment is killing your body and mind.     
     
## Quotation009     
Living and Dying
     
People get afraid of dying,     
but those who have not really lived cannot really die.     
Whether in this body or the next body     
you will live again like half dead.     
     
Really dying means not being born again.     
So to die fully learn to live fully.     
     
Don't get afraid of real death,     
you have not lived enough to die.     
It will take many births before you die     
in such a way that you are not born again.     
     
## Quotation010     
Inactivity
     
If you want to do an activity     
then you practice and master it.     
     
If you want to be in a     
state of inactivity     
then no practice is needed.     
     
But it is extremely difficult     
to enter into this state,     
called the state of being.     
     
## Quotation011     
Touching Fee 

Why do you touch the feet of elders or gurus?

You feel they are greater than us. Therefore whoever touches my feet I am greater than him/her. So touching the feet of others makes your ego more solid. Now, if some fellow doesn't touch your feet then you feel really miserable.

Thus the process which should have made you egoless serves the reverse purpose.

The second purpose of touching feet is fear. They can curse us or won't support us or go against us or someone else will touch their feet and get their favor.

The third purpose of touching feet is greed. We want something from them, their blessing, their property, their sweet words of praise that I am a Sanskari Naari or Purush.

The real purpose of touching feet is surrender. The problem is even after living so long on this planet most of us have not found a person or place where we can truly surrender. Nor did we make ourselves capable that someone surrendering before us without any fear or greed.


     
## Quotation012     
Respect vs Tolerance  
     
In life, learn to accept and respect your own people.     
The idea of tolerance is not good in relationships.     
     
## Quotation013     
What is Health?
   
Diseases can be defined and treated.     
The definition of health is the absence of disease.     
That which cannot be defined     
explicitly in words needs to be     
experienced and maintained silently within you.     
     
     
     
## Quotation014     
Rationality 
     
Rationality is not about     
knowing all the facts,     
but about knowing which facts are needed     
to understand something deeper.     
     
     
## Quotation015     
What is an Accident

No matter how fatal an event is, if your mind is prepared, that is not an accident. Because your mind has prepared well in advance to handle that event and this cannot be called an accident.     
     
## Quotation016     
Genius is Disease 

Geoffrey says if a common person is normal and normality is a health, then that genius is a disease because genius is abnormal. Society tolerates genius because his abnormality is useful for society.     
     
## Quotation017   
Worship 
  
Work is worship only when     
You can enjoy the Pooja.     
     
     
## Quotation018     
Self Beyond Word 
     
The mind is just an accumulation of words.     
Everyone is too obsessed with their mind.     
Self-knowledge becomes more and more unattainable.     
Because the self is beyond the words,     
or behind the words,     
or below the words,     
or above the words,     
but never in the words     
     
-Osho     
          
     
## Quotation019     
Accept Life in Totality     
     
A tree can be known by its fruit.     
If life is a tree,     
Then what is the final fruit of this tree?     
Death is the final fruit     
of this wonderful tree called life.     
     
Don't get afraid of the fruit.     
Just sit and breathe under this tree.     
Accept and embarrass this tree in totality.     
Then life will be full.     
After that what you do or not do is your choice.     
     
## Quotation020    
Existence without Adjectives
 
A flower is a flower. It is neither good nor bad.     
It exists as per its own power.     
So don't say you saw a beautiful flower.     
Let your own existence merge with the flower's     
without using those words of human language.     
     
Drop the words of praise and criticism, both.     
Learn to live without words especially     
when you experience oneness with something.     
In those moments of oneness,     
learn to get dissolved with the flower.     
       
     
## Quotation021     
Spiritual Gurus vs ML Engineer 
     
Machine Learning Engineers are teaching machines     
that, how to learn and behave like a human.     
     
Spiritual Gurus are teaching humans, 
how not to behave mechanically so that     
humans behave like life.     
     
The quality of life on this planet depends upon     
whether these two play their role perfectly or not.     
     
     
## Quotation022     
Creating Wonderful Human
     
There is no competition between humans and machines.     
There is competition between machines and machines.     
Less efficient machines will be in the garage or dustbin.     
Human is not about efficiency but about creativity, and uniqueness, beyond law and morality looking for coexistence.   
  
Unfortunately, In the last 200 years of industrialization,     
We have mastered the art of creating efficient machines.     

But we have not learned enough about creating lovely human beings.     
     
     
## Quotation023     
Happiness through Love   
     
If you want to be happy, then give love.     
This is nonsensical.     
To love, you don't need a reason.     
If you are loving for a reason then it is anything but love.     
Therefore, this technique of happiness will never work.     
     
If you have the ability to love     
then exercise it without reason.     
Something will happen to you.     
But don't expect even this.     
If you really had the ability to love     
and you could love without reason     
it will transform you.     
     
If you have a heart then     
you do not need proof of this.     
     
     
## Quotation024   
Janmashtami 2021     
     
Depending upon your sectoral and religious faith Shri Krishna can have a different meaning for you. You may consider him your Ishwar, Bhagwan, Mitra, Sakha, Bharata, Guide, Guru, Yogeshwar, or even your Shatru. All Bhava depends upon you.     
     
Irrespective of all these Bhava let that Dharma guide and inspire you for which Sri Krishna always lived. Irrespective of right and wrong of the rules of the king he always kept music, karma, struggle, compassion, playfulness, truthfulness, love, commitment, Shraddha, Vijyana, etc Dharma Lakshnam on the top of his mind to live his life.     
     
May that Dharma guide and protect your Mind, Intellect, and physical existence. May you be aligned with existence and Dharma.     
     
Wish you a very जन्माष्टमी     
     
## Quotation025     
Map is not Road     
     
Don't try to exit the house through a painted door.     
Look for a real door.     
Which door is real and which one is painted     
You cannot know till you use them.     
Reading a map is not sufficient.     
There should be an urgency to exit     
And there should be the strength to walk.     
Most of the time people live life in books or in the library,     
Get a certificate, degree, and appreciation from the close one.     
But they get crushed when life throws the situation.     
     
     
## Quotation026     
Transactions in the World   

First experience yourself as a human.     
Then serve humanity.     
Now, you will experience you are serving the self.     
Now you will not have a false ego in serving.     
When your hand feeds your mouth     
Who calls it donation and service?     
It is called eating.     
It is required for living.     
     
Similarly, your help to society     
is not a donation or service.     
Neither Punya for the next life.     
This is an ideal way of     
transacting with the environment around you.     
     
## Quotation027     
Morality vs Humanity   
     
Drop your religious morality in some river.     
First experience yourself as life.     
Be fair to yourself.     
Whatever other you experience around     
is the expansion of your own consciousness.     
     
Now, when this humanity is fully awakened in you.     
You don't need religious books to guide you.     
In the absence of humanity,     
all your books will make you a bookish human.     
A bookish man can cause more harm     
than one who has not read.     
One hesitates to give an opinion     
and another speaks like an authority.     

- Sadguru JV
     
## Quotation028     
Six Topics to Think   
     
A serious human thinker     
must think deeper     
about these six topics throughout his/her life.     
     
Self (जीव), World (जगत),     
God (ईश्वर), Bondage (बन्धन),     
Liberation (मोक्ष) and Tools for Liberation (मोक्ष साधन)     
     
(A normal human waste     
his/her entire lifetime in thinking     
about survival, enjoyment,     
heaven/hell, repenting and     
being nostalgic about past,     
planning or worrying about future)     
     
- BrahmaSutra     
     
     
## Quotation029     
Purpose of the Human Life 
    
If you cannot get benefited by human birth     
then you lost the right of being human.     
     
So what was the benefit of being human?     
Having secular education, making money,     
getting married, having children,     
making infrastructure for enjoying     
and watching laughter channels to laugh, and     
looking for little hope of having joy in life?     
     
You forgot to ask, who made you human?     
Your Karma? Ishwara?     
Why did you become human?     
Because you couldn't liberate yourself in your last life?     
Now ask yourself,     
What have I done in this life to liberate myself?     
     
If nothing, then no Moksha in this life.     
And in that case, in the next life,     
you lost the right of taking human birth.     
     
     
     
## Quotation030     
Life in Living Being 

Smallest leaf of a plant or small flower     
reminds deep thinking human     
about God and His creation.     
But this feeling you won't get     
even after watching the tallest and grandest     
human-made buildings. Why?     
What is there in that smallest leaf or flower?     
The real life!     
     
Pay more attention to life than     
to buildings, furniture, and automobiles     
And you will be filled with joy and life.     
     
     
## Quotation031     
Defending in ignorance     
     
The body is physical, so it must be defended     
and protected with your best skill and effort.     
     
But most of the time     
it looks that ideology, religion, traditions, god, and culture     
are also as solid as physical existence.     
People defend these with immense     
effort and attack others fiercely.     
Without realizing that nonphysical is fluid     
and the only way to protect that is,     
to refine and don’t allow these     
to freeze in time.     
So discuss, argue and debate.     
No one is your enemy,     
except your frozen identity     
and object identification.     
     
## Quotation032     
Source of Words and Objects     
     
No matter how good an artist you are     
You cannot draw a sky without objects.     
But space still exists.     
Objects around us may be     
illusions in space     
but space is never an illusion.     
     
No matter how good an orator you are     
You cannot speak a “silence”.     
But without silence, you cannot speak even a word.     
In silence, all the words exist.     
Words between the two silences may be an untruth     
But silence is never untruth.     
In fact, millions of words     
exists in the same one truthful silence.     
     
Knower of the Self says     
All objects and words are illusions.     
They are the form and name     
of something which we don't know.     
We are familiar with people     
and objects around us.     
Therefore, we use them better.     
But, no one knows what they are made of.     
     
Perhaps the name which we perceive     
is coming from silence     
And objects which we perceive     
is coming from that objectless space.     
     
## Quotation033     
Mind and Life     
     
Mind is about memories     
So it is about the past.     
The mind has stored experiences of     
success and failure.     
We want to repeat success and avoid failures.     
So we think about and plan the future.     
Thus the mind dwells on the past and future.     
     
Life happens when you are breathing     
The last breath is past     
The next breath is future     
The breath you are taking or leaving is present.     
     
The mind is about the past and future     
Life is always present.     
Those who live in memories or planning     
They are bound to miss the Life, the present.     
     
Those who live in the present     
do not get perturbed by the     
action of the past and the loss or gain of the future.     
     
## Quotation034     
Our Mind     
     
Our mental and physical habits of     
action or karma are so deep-rooted in us     
that we think that the thought of     
No action is taboo in our society.     
Due to this reason, everyone is busy all the time,     
and thinking it is a virtue and being busy is a great thing.     
We take pride in this madness.     
The more busy a person is,     
the more important he is considered.     
     
However, someday you can try     
That, you will not do anything for thirty minutes     
No walking, sleeping, eating, drinking, working,     
talking, watching, listening, or thinking.     
Just sitting in full awareness.     
It is the most difficult task for our monkey-like     
all-time dancing mind.     
     
Our mind has been trained in such a way     
that the mind remains busy and restless effortlessly.     
But there is no training for entering     
into a state of non-action.     
And we take pride in such a half-working mind!     
     
## Quotation035     
Travel and Direction of Travel    
     
If you desire then there is a goal or destination.     
If there is a destination there is a journey     
If there is a journey there is a road     
You travel on the road to reach     
the goal and fulfill your desire.     
     
If you are unhappy, puzzled,     
unsatisfied with people and     
circumstances around you, feeling bored then     
your solution exists inside not outside.     
     
That is what realized one calls the realization of self.     
Now, if self-realization is the goal     
or destination of life then     
all wandering, traveling, and roads     
will lead to more puzzles, confusion, and dissatisfaction.     
No amount of good karma or     
Donation or Puja or Prayer or Morality or Reading     
will take you to yourself.     
     
All these will lead to an unnecessarily     
long route to reach the self.     
Perhaps the whole life will go     
and you will never reach the self.     
     
So what to do?     
Nothing, simply sit and don't do anything     
Your doing is causing more problems for yourself.     
Perhaps your sitting calmly     
will take you closer to your being.     
And hence realizing the self.     
     
## Quotation036     
Krishna and Cows     
     
If your father has one lakh cows.     
Then these cows could be giving at least 50 thousand liters of milk.     
If one cow gives minimum of five liters of milk every day     
then milk production is 2.5 lakhs liters per day.     
What will you do with that milk?     
Of course, you have a big ecosystem,     
the wealth will be distributed among those,     
who are managing these cows.     
     
In this situation will you go to a neighbor's house     
to steal curd and butter?     
But Hindu Kathakaar are repeating this story     
since the 15th century, the time of Surdaas.     
And we say this is our culture     
and Itihaas or Puran and what not.     
When did it happen that the Hindus culture     
stopped using logic like Abrahamic culture?     
The logic of repeating the text from books     
without stopping and pondering on the meaning.     
     
I am sorry to hurt the feelings of those     
who believe too much and rationalize less.     
But that is what my Hindu tradition is.     
It is about, keep asking questions,     
sitting near a Guru and writing Upanishads.     
     
## Quotation037     
Suffering, Pain, and Happiness     
     
Suffering is in the mind, pain is on the body.     
Mostly suffering (दुःख) is a sign of richness     
And pain (कष्ट) is a sign of poverty.     
So the rich are suffering due to relationships,     
ego, power, promotion, and taxes,     
But the poor are living in the pain of clothless winter,     
houseless summer, hungry stomach, and ill body.     
     
Rich suffers more because they have resources     
but they have more desire than their resources.     
Poor surfers less because their desires are limited     
due to the limited resources.     
     
People don't know what is suffering     
They simply suffer in the hope of pleasure     
And in the presence of their endless desires     
Those who know what truly suffering is.     
They know why we suffer.     
The moment we know this truly     
We definitely know how not to suffer.     
     
Those whose desires are fulfilled     
are not happy for more than a moment.     
Those whose desires are not fulfilled are always unhappy.     
     
     
     
## Quotation038     
Happiness and Friends     
     
Buddha is sitting under a tree,     
He is blissful and he is fully aware of his bliss.     
The tree is also blissful but he is not aware.     
What is the use of that joy, peace, and happiness     
which you get when you are     
half-conscious or lost consciousness?     
     
So remaining blissful without the external help     
of friends or alcohol or steroids or marijuana is more sustainable.     
So be blissful and then live with friends.     
Rather than going to friends and hoping     
they will wipe your tears and laugh with you in your happiness.     
     
If they don't do what you expect     
then you will feel they are not your friends.     
In fact, they are expressing themselves freely before you.     
And you want your friends to become     
slaves of your emotional swings.     
     
## Quotation039     
Circular Life     
     
When we took birth,     
life started and consciousness was very limited.     
Life is circular so we started the journey in the circle     
but the face is away from that starting point,     
At that time we are least conscious and     
our back is towards that starting point.     
     
When we become older the journey     
on the circle is getting completed and     
we have our face toward the starting point.     
By this time, we should be more aware and conscious.     
Returning home in full awareness is better     
than dying in addiction or with unfulfilled desires.     
     
Unfortunately, even in the evenings of life,     
there are a lot of confusion, unfulfilled desires,     
and revenge and the whole life looks purposeless.     
It means you are returning home     
but walking in the opposite direction of your face.     
     
     
## Quotation040 
Listener, Message, and Messenger
 
It is less important what is written in Bhagwat Gita     
It is more important what you think about     
Krishna and the circumstances around him.     
     
This understanding gives you an opportunity     
to reflect, learn a philosophy of life, and live that. 

Without that, you just have memorized a few stories to impress children around you but you are still thirsty under the fountain.   
     
     
## Quotation041     
God Supports the Weaker?     
     
Earlier when the medical system was not modernized a mother was giving birth to ten children. In spite of that population being less in those days. That was because only strong life will survive and the remaining will die. Those who survive have fought with the environment and are winners of life. They live longer and whatever life they have they would have the least problems like BP, sugar, cancer, thyroid, heart attack, kidney, etc.     
     
Today a mother gives birth to only one child and no matter what, that child may be weak or strong against nature parents want to make sure the child must live. Thus we have so many weak people around. Interestingly, someone looks strong but a single emotional or physical blow of life can throw them to the earth.     
     
After this our whole life we spend money in the hospital and ensure the weak must survive. Not only that we have laws and religion in support of the weak.     
     
In religion, they are saying God favors the weak. And in law, they say weaker is more privileged. With this mindset when merit or strength is sidelined, we are going against nature. Which says, a stronger one will survive. We have to pay the cost of this kind of thinking. Nature is cruel, it doesn't care about your religion and your religious books. She knows only adaptable and strong should survive and the remaining has to be recycled quickly. But our wealth, health system, culture, and emotions come in the way of Her work.     
     
     
## Quotation042     
Empty Mind     
     
Whatever a human earns by doing will die one day.     
What a human earns by being cannot be     
taken away by death.     
So, why does the human is in a race of so much doing     
and human doesn't have time for sitting     
and to be in the state of being?     
     
An empty mind is not the devil's home     
But, it is your seat of staying and looking at the world passively.     
Unfortunately, you cannot have an empty mind because it is almost impossible for most of humanity.     
This is unfortunate but true.     
     
That is why our society has glory for the action     
but not for the empty mind.     
It is unfortunate but this also is true.     
     
## Quotation043     
What should we do, for the peace of Mind?     
     
Even after working so much and doing so much when there is no peace in mind people think there is a problem in their way of doing or seriousness in the efforts or fate so they ask what else I should do.     
     
We need to understand peace comes from your state of being     
No amount of doing can help you.     
If you tried all your ways, your energy is exhausted then pause your actions     
and be Saakshi of the drama coming from the three planes of your existence.     
Then you are entering into a state of being. Where existence “as is” matters not your actions.     
     
The more you remain in that more you will know     
that the peace doesn't come out of doing but exiting from that madness of now what should I do (Ab Kya Karun)     
     
     
## Quotation044     
Purpose of Education     
     
What is the use of that education which teaches us everything but doesn't teach us how to handle our own mind? That is why Dhyana Vidhya is critical in human life.     
     
     
     
## Quotation045     
Part of the Problem     

We try to make people, society, and villages around us peaceful but we are restless.     

A restless mind is a problem and not the solution for the family, people, and society around. So even a restless Nobel prize winner is part of the problem.     
     
     
## Quotation046     
Opposites Attracts 

Opposite Attracts. It is the law of nature that two opposites attract. If you are getting attracted towards something then it must be the opposite of you. If you move into the opposite then there will be friction, argument, fight, and power tussle to dominate.    
 
If you know how to handle this then you will find peace in the turbulence of life else you will remain restless.     
Another way to live life is that you don't move towards the opposite, this will give boredom.     
The third way to live is, you don't move mentally at all and witness the physical movements.     
     
## Quotation047     
Purpose of Education 2    
     
What is the use of that education that teaches us everything but doesn't teach us how to handle our own mind? That is why Dhyana Vidhya is critical in human life.     
     
We try to make people, society, and villages around us peaceful but we are restless. A restless mind is a problem not the solution for the people and society around. So even a restless Nobel prize winner is part of the problem.     
     
What is the use of knowing everything about the world but you don't know anything about yourself? So trying to know the self through TV, Newspaper, and Social gossip is a futile effort. That is why knowing the self is most important for both knowing the world and being joyful.     
     
## Quotation048     
Sky can arrest you  
     
There are some who feel the sky has jailed them under it.     
Miserable are these minds     
who experience freedom in their locked room.     
     
## Quotation049     
Bondage is our creation   
     
When the umbilical cord is cut from the mother, that is called birth.     
It means you are free now.     
Go and explore the world free from mother.     
Unfortunately, we develop so many mental cords     
and keep emphasizing I am a slave,     
I am bound, and crying for Moksha.     
     
Bondage is our own creation during living,     
Moksha is given at birth.     
     
## Quotation050     
Love and Mind   
     
You can accumulate everything,     
but You cannot accumulate love.     
It happens at the moment of your breath.     
Rest, what you feel in your mind     
is a memory of love and not love.     
Thinking or imagining about love is not Love.     
     
## Quotation051     
Life Style & Happiness     
     
Education is a tool to get a good job.     
Your location of living and the company your work for 
are tools to show how you earn and spend.     
Your dynastic name shows how great your family was.     
     
But how sensibly you live and how compassionate you are for the entire ecosystem around is a tool for measuring your happiness.     
     
Everything can be measured by others,     
your happiness is measured only by you,     
Because only your heart knows how compassionate you are, what others see is your mask.     
     
## Quotation052     
Happiness First     
     
Ask yourself whether I am working for my happiness or 
I am working at my best because I am happy and I am not wandering or searching for any happiness.     
     
Working for happiness can lead to frustrations, in the second no win or loss can affect your happiness.     
     
## Quotation053     
Success and Action     
     
Success rarely means what you want or what you get.     
     
Most of the time it means your willingness to take the next step even if previous one failed hugely.     
     
## Quotation054      
Love and Moksha     
     
Physical or skin-deep relationship is lust and not love. In reality, love is not rosy; it also tests your capacity to surrender, forgive, hope endlessly, sustain pain, and become a better human.     
     
In all the circumstances if you remain sweet always then psychologically you can transcend the love. In that state no desire even for Moksha.     
     
## Quotation055        
Real Face     
     
If you have many friends who do not know each other but they all know you with different faces, then it is not necessary that you are fooling and flirting with others. It is also possible that you are a person from the government's intelligence services. Why do you want to keep multiple faces to live a simple life?     
     
     
     
## Quotation056       
Food Habit     

Logic of non-vegetarians is, plants are life and without eating life we cannot sustain therefore you eat potato and I eat chicken both are the same. It is a matter of taste and choice of food. So don't comment on my food.     
     
I don't believe in commenting about the food of others, nor is it a moral or religious issue for me. But is the issue of food that simple?     
     
## Quotation057     
Understanding, Interpreting, and Solutioning
     
Who should be blamed when a Leaf falls from the tree....     
     
Is it the wind that blew it away?     
     
Or the tree that let it go?     
     
Or the leaf itself which is weak to hold the branch?     
     
Life unfolds many events before us, how we understand is all up to us. Misunderstanding is also an understanding. The way we understand and interpret, we try to solve the puzzle.     
     
     
## Quotation058        
Language of the Cosmos     
     
What you order from the cosmos to deliver is your choice.     
     
What the cosmos delivers on your lap is a choice of the cosmos. There may be a problem of misunderstanding because the cosmos doesn’t understand English, Hindi, and Chinese languages. It catches your intention and intensity at which you vibrate.     
     
Finally how you feel and what you become after the cosmos has delivered on your lap is 100% your choice. So giving credit or debit of what you become to some other person or circumstances is childish.     
     
## Quotation059        
Meaning of Spiritual Life     
     
If you are a spiritually looking person or people think you are spiritual then society has a separate set of expectations from you.     
     
If you are spiritual in the inner sense then the cosmos doesn't have different rules to deal with you in a different way. The same law of nature applies to you.     
     
The only sign of more spirituality in you is in spite of all circumstances and garbage thrown upon you, you do not become bitter or judgmental for anything. You still take every moment of life as a fresh, smile on everything around you.     
     
## Quotation060     
Means and Goal     
     
Technology is exciting but math & science, the mother of technology, is boring. People like high-tech products.     
     
Democracy is good but we don't like intense debates, which is the mother of democracy. People like chit-chat and sweet talk.     
     
Money is good but sincere and honest efforts required to earn the money are painful. People like money by all kinds of means, the lottery and jackpot are great.     
     
Cleanliness is good but efforts required to keep mental and physical cleanliness are not sustainable. People like some other person should do this for them.     
     
We are interested in results but not ready to put effort into the processes through which results come.     
     
What kind of laziness and ignorance is this?     
     
     
## Quotation061     
Purpose of the History     
     
We want peace and harmony in society, but we hate to discuss history. Why?     
     
Because we are not mature enough to handle our emotions that arose from the past bitter moments! The greatest value that history adds is if the same event happens today how differently we will respond to the situation. But this so-called secular system makes us cowardly, forgetful, impatient, and suppressive in emotions rather than being wise     
and learning.     
     
The wise way is, if either me, my ancestors, or anyone, who has done wrong we should debate, analyze, and do "Prayaschit" for that and ensure not to repeat that. But we become offensive or defensive and justify our position, and this is a hard part so better put history under the carpet. Put your hand on your heart and say all is well.     
     
History is boring and hated by those who don't have the steel to endure the pain of the past and the maturity to identify lessons learned.     
     
## Quotation062     
Saakshi of Mind     
     
To live in harmony with everybody in your surroundings is a great skill. But the greatest skill is to live in harmony with our own always-dancing mind. Most of the people are restless with their dancing mind and they want to control it.     
     
## Quotation063     
Restfulness     
     
When we stop copying others' lifestyle and coping with others to overcome or compete with them then this is a sign of settling our mind and we start moving towards mental restfulness.     
     
## Quotation064     
The Way to know the Self     
     
There is a magical moving mud pot in your hands. God may have created it or it came into existence on its own or you as potter created this. Once the pot came into existence, post that what kind of work, puja, karma that pot needs to do to know that my fundamental material is clay, pot is my form and not my reality?     
     
## Quotation065     
Types of Vedanta     
     
Prasthantrayi is the fundamental work of Hinduism. It contains Upanishads, Bhagwat Geeta and Brahma Sutram. Broadly there are three schools of thought in Hinduism (advaita, vishishtha adavaita, dvaita) and they interpret Prasthantriyam as per their school. Which school of thought a Hindu adopts is left upon him to choose based on his/her Swabhav. Most Hindus don't know even this primary fact, that is why they look, either "confused", or “all is the same concept”, or “all old is useless”, or “all old is gold”, or "our guru knows all".     
     
Rejecting or accepting ideas makes sense only when you have knowledge.     
     
## Quotation066     
Knowledge Base in Sanskrit     
     
Most people think Sanskrit is a language for religion, prayer, tantra, mantra, etc. We must understand this is a language that has the largest knowledge base of ancient times which is related to physics, chemistry, mathematics, astronomy, astrology, construction, transportation, medicine, agriculture, etc. 

In the corporate world, what do you call those bunch of people who ignore the previous body of knowledge or organizational wisdom and reinvent the wheel?     
     
## Quotation067     
Price for Freedom   


If you are stuck in a cage, and the only path to freedom goes through a pit below you. But this pit is full of filth. If you go through that you can be free in the next one hour. Now, if you choose that then this is the price you put for your freedom, ready to face even filth!     
     
Freedom of any kind, physical or emotional or mental is not free! More the bondage or more ugly is the surrounding, the higher is the price.     
     
Fortunately, most people grumble about all this ugliness. But, many times they build philosophy and poetry around all this and convince themselves that this is how life happens, or they start glamorizing struggle, suffering, pain, etc using different poetry or music. With this attitude can you come out?     
     
     
## Quotation068     
Manas and Chaitnya     
     
Oh Manas, you get Rasa in the world. Therefore I know it is not possible to keep you joyful always. But you should know that I am pure consciousness (Chaitanya) and I am always aware of your moods. Therefore when you get too tired, sad, and bored then don't go further in the world and complain to the people in the world. Come to me, I am pure consciousness. I can heal you. But for that, you need to sit near me. In your interest will you listen to me?     
     
## Quotation069      
Worldly Joy     
     
If you chase worldly joy with immense intensity and a single mind then very soon you will find there is nothing more to enjoy and all energy is drained out. Fortunately, people enjoy the world like a drunkard, who has fallen on the roadside, feeling on top of the world, and the next day he forgets what happened last night. Due to this unconscious living, the desire to enjoy never gets satisfied even at the time of death.     
     
## Quotation070     
Three things to happen     
     
I pray that three things must happen to every human.     
1. Knowledge that he/she is genderless pure consciousness and nothing else.     
2. Experience of that consciousness as a subject.     
3. If possible then retention of that awareness for the longest period of human life, irrespective of whether life sits as an unemployed person or works as the highest politician or super successful businessperson or highly appreciated artist.     
     
First is Gyan Prapti, second is Darshan, and third is Moksha. Rest all are good stories to engage the mind.     
     
## Quotation071      
Information Bombardment     
     
Once upon a time humans had little information, so it was precious, but people had a lot of time to internalize even a small piece of information.     
     
Today is the time when information is free but there is no time to know what is on the harddisk or phone or notebook. Where is the time to put efforts for self-realization?     
     
In this age, even if some god comes from the sky and gives us one more piece of information - “Tat Tvam Asi”. How will it help us? No time to contemplate and internalize!     
     
     
## Quotation072     
About Awareness     
     
I am that awareness, in the presence of which this body was depending upon parents for walking and eating.     
     
I am that awareness, in the presence of which I went to school, knew my ignorance, and started learning.     
     
Today, even after knowing so much and becoming independent life I am aware that I don't know many things.     
     
I am that awareness in the presence of what, people know many things and know that they do not know. I am a mother of that body which was packed in a seed, became powerful to express, and finally lying on the bed to die and become seed again.     
     
     
     
## Quotation073     
Limitation of Grammar     
     
Sentences are made of words.     
Sentences want to hold the meaning.     
A sentence is much more than the words it is made of. No matter how great an orator, writer, or philosopher you are, you always struggle to construct sentences that can communicate your feelings.     
     
Sentences are like a sieve that tries to hold the moonlight. Yes, some light is blocked but if you compare the light intensity within the sieve's boundary and outside of that you know most of the light still passes through.     
     
No matter how hard you try, the meaning cannot be conveyed in words. Life, its meaning, its possibilities, and its emotions still get slipped from the mouth of even great poets, sages, and philosophers.     
     
## Quotation074     
AI and Human Jobs     
     
The problems of humans and machines are completely different. A human falls in love, has desires, and has emotions of lust, greed, compassion, pity, etc. A human looks for freedom, liberation, and moksha. Human gets bored with the same art, music, and technology so they express themselves in different way and create new solutions.     
     
So no matter how hard science and technology try, human intelligence can never be replaced by artificial intelligence unless some want to behave like a machine. A machine can never behave like a perfect human, especially a human who applies his or her mind and is a free soul.     
     
Solutions are always followed by problems. The problem always lies in the human mind. Whatever you give them they can be unhappy. So they look for a solution. Imitation is a different thing but do you think a machine can get tired, bored, and unhappy truly? If so then the whole purpose of creating a machine will be defeated.     
     
So don't get scared that AI or ML is going to take the job of humans. But yes definitely those humans, who are behaving like a machine or doing the jobs of machines need to be worried about the AI age.     
     
     
## Quotation075     
Type of Mind     
     
The words of spirituality are like water drops. On what kind of mind those are falling matters.     
     
If a mind is like a water lake then it will disappear in one way,     
If a mind is like soil then it will disappear in another way,     
If a mind is like a hot plate then it will disappear another way     
And if it is like a lotus leaf then it will remain their whole day.     
     
Knowing the kind of mind one has is helpful.     
     
## Quotation076     
Infinity Divider     
     
From the highest possible level of experience you will realize there is only one infinity and nothing else. And that Infinity is the infinite capability of the human mind to create or divide the world around infinitely. While in truth what human is dividing is that one infinity.     
     
Our mind always remains busy and keeps dividing, objectifying, and labeling around that one infinity. Is that one infinity an object which can be really infinitely divided or something else?     
     
## Quotation077     
Objectification of Subject     
     
You believe in a person, object, event, or something for which you are not a witness and you have never seen. Based on that belief you want to predict the future of yours, others, and the outcome of the event.     
     
Thus, what you believe in is an object in your thoughts and you are the subject, a thinker, seer, perceiver, and experiencer.     
     
Why do you do this for God? Is God an object of your thoughts? Is he not a witness of your thought madness? Why do you attempt to objectify something which is an absolute subject?     
     
As per an individual’s ideology, either He is there or not there, simple. Why believe in God as if he is an object or event which you have not seen?     
     
This is called madness of mind; it wants to objectify everything.     
     
## Quotation078     
Tragedy of Thinking     
     
The tragedy of human thinking is, one, about whom he thinks is omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent, and absolutely free, but always doubted His existence.     
     
But one who is never denied existence is limited, miserable, ignorant, alpiscient (knows least), sufferer, bounded life.     
     
Is it possible to overcome this tragedy by having a materialistic mind?     
     
## Quotation079     
Awareness     
     
In awareness when physical darkness or light is experienced that time neither darkness physically goes nor light becomes brighter.     
     
In that light of awareness, you are aware that it is the dark, and it is the light. Thus, the awareness is beyond your darkness and light.     
     
## Quotation080     
Human Fear is Permanent     
     
A bird does not have fear of falling when flying, a fish does not have fear of drowning while swimming, and a monkey jumps confidently from one branch to another without the fear of falling. But a human has fear in everything whatever he or she does, no matter how small the task is.     
     
## Quotation081     
What is Nididhyasana?     
     
To see the duality all around, you need not put much thought into it because it looks obvious. But to see the unity you need to think a lot and much deeper.     
     
Once you know the unity, then to realize that unity you need to put effort, and in Vedanta, this is called Nididhyasa.     
     
## Quotation082     
World is Perfect     
     
God cannot do one thing, which a human can do. He cannot make a mistake! The world is perfect. It cannot be better than this.     
     
Whatever imperfection we see here, it is because we have messed up with "our world" and we are complaining about "the world".     
     
## Quotation083     
Mistaking, Blaming, and Forging
     
Mistaking, Blaming, and Forgiving all are acts of humans at different levels of consciousness and awareness. You can ask yourself at the level of consciousness you live most of the time.     
     
## Quotation084     
Forgetting vs Forgiving     
     
Forgetfulness is a quality of mind, and that is not in our direct control. What we forget and what we remember is completely controlled by our Prakruti, which dominates us.     
     
On the other hand, forgiveness is completely our choice. Choice of letting things go and stopping self-suffering.     
     
Both impact our life hugely and have iota impact on others. And we commonly say I have forgiven somebody as if I have done a favor to others.     
     
     
## Quotation085     
Source of Happiness     
     
Throughout life we work hard so that we earn something, some relationships, some respect, some recognition, some love, etc. This all makes us happy.     
     
Finally, a stage can come when we realize that we were putting the chariot before horses and driving our chariot throughout our whole life and complaining that the chariot is a problem, horses are useless, life is unfair, and people are selfish.     
     
Horses in a chariot are like happiness, let them drive the cart. They should be first in the chariot. If you think the other way around then failure and frustration are the earnings of life.     
     
Don't think if horses are running it means they are happy, in fact, they get tired. Horses need to start running because they are happy and filled.     
     
Running or any kind of doing is not the real source of happiness.     
     
## Quotation086     
Attitude towards Luck     
     
Does luck exist? People can define luck in different ways and then do the advocacy for its existence or non-existence. But it is also true that no matter how much we work, we cannot plan luck.     
     
Now, what is the use of trying to bring that uncontrollable boy into the room, knowing we cannot control him, he makes the room more chaotic.     
     
It is better he remains outside and once the game is over we say that all played well in the room but that outside boy spoiled my game and made someone else the winner. It is better than bringing him indoors at the start of the game.     
     
While going to play or while playing it is always good to pretend that nothing called luck exists, which wants to spoil my game.     
     
     
## Quotation087     
Interpreting Math Formula     
     
Expenditure = Income - Saving     
Saving = Income - Expenditure     
     
Mathematically both are the same equation. But first was the way our earlier generations lived life and second is the way the current generation lives.     
     
Thus, math looks good, simple, and nimble but interpretation creates life, philosophies, and books.     
     
## Quotation088     
Hard work vs Donkey Work     
     
There is no replacement for hard work.     
     
But there is a replacement for donkey work, mechanic work, and monotonous work.     
     
It is our responsibility to identify the difference between the two and don't venture into the least creative, joyless, donkey work. Every person enjoys some work, for others, it may be donkey work.     
     
     
## Quotation089     
Level of Living Philosophy     
     
This is the only life. What I got to enjoy or suffer is my hard work and my fate in this world. What others enjoy or suffer is their karma and fate. This is the lowest way of philosophy and living.     
     
There is God who tests us and gives us punishment and reward, joy and happiness. This is a philosophy of children.     
     
There is nothing but our karma responsible for our joy, happiness, and miseries. God does not have anything to do with our ignorance and personal problems. The Law of karma is non-negotiable and supreme. This is a mature philosophy.     
     
One can go beyond the law of karma and bypass the results of karma. Thus you can do something which even gods cannot do. But for that one needs to understand, realize and experience one's true nature and existence. This philosophy comes from the ancient Vedantic mind of Rushis.     
     
Since ancient times, Bharat has been full of people who lived all these different kinds of philosophies in their life.     
     
There is absolutely nothing wrong with any one of those philosophies. They all have their relevance. The point is which one do I really live in? The second point is, am I pushing my philosophy on others?     
     
## Quotation090     
Natural Mind vs Cultured Mind     
     
Making conclusions, and assigning labels to people, objects, and events around is a habit of a natural mind.     
     
To build a cultured mind from the natural mind we need to expose the mind to 360 degrees around the object and events, time, space, and circumstances. That mind will never label anything as good or bad.     
     
But the natural mind loves this good bad assignment work and that too at a very high speed. Even highly rational people fall prey to this.     
     
Did you know it takes huge time, patience, perseverance, and Tapasya to build a cultured mind which is just a witness of the world and not a label assigner? University teaches us earning skills. Who teaches the art of making a cultured mind? It is left to human struggle and unfortunately, most of humanity fails in this struggle.     
     
Even after living many years on this planet, suffering and enjoying, learning and experiencing many things most people still have that natural mind.     
     
## Quotation091     
Reflective Mind     
     
If eyes, which can see the entire world, cannot see themselves, maximum what it can see is the mirror image of itself.     
     
Then how come I, the knower, the seer, and the experiencer of the world who experiences my body pain and my comforts, emotional swings of my mind know, can see myself? Maximum what I can see is a reflection in the mirror of a meditative mind. I, the holder of the body and mind can never see myself as the holder!     
     
But, if you are happy even with that mirror image then learn some methods of creating a reflective mind.     
     
## Quotation092     
Dissolve your Suffering     
     
What happens to me or what others do to me is the journey of my own karma.     
     
What pain I am having in my body because of hurt or fever or blister etc that too is my karma.     
     
But the joy, happiness or suffering I am feeling right now is 100% my own creation at the present moment. It has nothing to do with the karma of the past. No amount of good karma from the past or present can take away this suffering of the present moment from me. An understanding that I am the creator of the present cuts the knots of suffering.     
     
     
## Quotation093     
Angerlessness is not Virtue     
     
If anger does not come to you at all or you cannot control the anger at all or you are angry all the time then these are the built-in tendencies in you. If you consider them bad and want to address those then you call it a medical problem.     
     
If anger comes to you at injustice or irrationality and you are able to manage, direct and control that in your favor then it is an achievement of a trained mind.     
     
Do you think anger not coming is a virtue of humans? Managing that for the good of the maximum is definitely an art.     
     
## Quotation094     
Knowing Facts vs Realizing Truth     
     
As per Mahabharata, Krishna tried to teach Bhagwat Geeta first to Duruyodhana but he said I know all this but I am helpless nothing can be done. In fact, for this daringness, Duruyodhana tried to arrest Krishna.     
     
But before the Kurukshetra war when an opportunity came then Krishna tried to teach Arjuna. At that time Arjuna told Krishna that I know all about what is wrong and what is right. But I don't know what controls me, what forces us to do something which we end up doing. Controlling the mind is like controlling the powerful wind. I am feeling helpless. I accept you, my Guru, you teach me how to think properly. And for this Arjuna surrendered at the feet of Krishna. His close friend, his chariot driver becomes his Guru.     
     
It is not about how many facts we know, it is about what we are ready to do or give up to realize that Truth.     
     
## Quotation095    
Vijay Dashmi 2021   

Rama didn’t have any living Ravana inside so he could identify and kill the Ravana of the world easily.     
     
Today everyone has at least one Ravana living inside either inside our bodily existence or our family or surrounding but we want to kill Ravana outside either in society or media or neighboring nations. Tokenism, symbolism, or festivity is ok, but Is it possible to burn the Raavan outside without even identifying what is Ravan inside us and fixing that first?     
     
Happy Vijaya Dashmi.     
     
## Quotation096     
Heating to Blasting     
     
Heat and Light both are radiations. But, what a source radiates depends upon the source and the surrounding.     
     
Most of the day if a source generates light sometimes it can also heat up. But if a source is always generating heat then the source can blast at one time. How long it will take to blast depends upon the content of which the heating container is made.     
     
While talking or exchanging ideas shouldn't we consider this principle of physics?     
     
## Quotation097     
Symmetry for Survival     
     
Pay close attention to objects around you and observe a principle of symmetry. Either there are two distinct symmetrical objects or one object can be folded into a symmetrical way. The Ears, eyes, hands, and legs are two and symmetrical. But the nose, heart, and intestine even if it is one it is symmetrical.     
     
Observe buildings, furniture, automobiles, flowers, or plants. Symmetry is everywhere. Even human-created things cannot survive if they are not symmetrical. They can survive only if they are symmetrical.     
     
## Quotation098     
Avoidable Assumptions     

Why do people assume when they have an opportunity to communicate and verify the truth?     
     
We know, it happens only when trust evaporates and they think that they will not know the truth.     
     
But, does assumption help in knowing the truth or demolishing the wall of distrust?     
     
     
## Quotation099     
Sensitive Heart     

Those who switch on the air-conditioner in winter after taking a bath in hot water will not be able to understand the pain of people sleeping on footpaths, especially in the winter. For that one day, they need to set the AC at 5 degrees temperature and sleep on the naked floor with a thin cover.     
     
Some will say their karma vs my karma. But that is the most irresponsible way of thinking and living. Some others are so much drenched up to their necks in their own problems that they neither have money nor emotions left to think about the surroundings and forget about doing.     
     
We need not be missionaries or religious or activists or philosophers or moralists or have deep pockets to be sensitive to our surroundings. We just need 100% rightly working heart and mind.     
     
Not going to a hospital for heart or mind treatment doesn't always mean we have a healthy heart or mind. It also means it is irreparable.     
     
## Quotation100     
Arrogance     
     
Arrogance of doing Seva in politicians, Arrogance of money, infrastructure, and power in saints and sadhus, the arrogance of Knowledge in children, the arrogance of Tyagya in old age man, the arrogance of paying taxes in Grahasta, and pride of leaving food in a sick person makes me laugh most. But this all is possible in Maya. But isn't it true?  

Some things are happening because of situations and circumstances, and some other things have to happen because you promised that to people. Where is the place for arrogance?   
     
## Quotation101     
Attachment vs Love     
     
Our children have chosen to manifest through us. It is our luck that they chose us and trusted us for their guidance. We should nurture them like a gardener. How big a tree can become, how many fruits it will bear, how long it will live, how many fruits I will eat from the tree etc all is not the business of the gardener.     
     
Our children are not ours but they manifest through us. But because of our too much time, money, and energy investment we become possessive and this return-driven mindset causes lots of self-pain. The problem is not attachment or a profit-driven human mind, this is de facto human design, and this is how humans are made.     
     
Humans need to learn the art of how not getting entangled while in intense love with anyone, including children.     
     
## Quotation102     
Scientist vs Spiritualist     
     
Nature has some top secrets, which scientists are decoding using one kind of method and tools and spiritualists are decoding using other kinds of methods.     
     
At every step of the revelation of the secrets, scientists are trying to bring some liberation for the whole of humanity but spiritualists bring liberation for the individual, and with that wisdom, they keep working.     
     
Without repeating the experiments the next generation can take benefit from the scientific success. But in the case of spiritual knowledge, everyone needs to put in the same efforts for realization     
     
## Quotation103     
Dukh me Sumiran Sab Kare     
     
Dukh me Sumiran sab kare sukh me karen na koi     
Jo dukh me sumiran kare, dukh kahe ko hoi     
     
Sumiran means, remember, keeping in mind.     
What is that remembering which dukh will never come?     
     
Beyond poetry, if you look seriously there is nothing that can avoid human suffering. But still, if we want to do "sumiran" then "sumiran" of "karma gati", "sumiran" of "satya-asatya" of entire existence, "sumiran" of results of "viveka-aviveka buddhi karma", "sumiran" of our virtues and strength can help us in understanding the nature of suffering. 

We need to keep in mind pain is physical, and it goes only with physical healing but suffering is mental and goes away with understanding and Sumiran of the right things.     
     
Some people say remembering god will take away your Dukkha. But using this solution we are replacing Dukkha with our deity and it is a temporary solution because it is not easy even for great devotees to keep Ishta always in the mind.     
     
## Quotation104     
Teachers of Dukkha All Around     
     
Even after so many years of living on this planet, if I am unhappy then it is nobody's fault. 

I liked suffering, made philosophy, song, and poetry out of this, and created heart-loving music of suffering. Sometimes I suffer because something happened to me. Other times because it happened to my people. 

No blissed person taught me and the sufferers told me bliss is a mirage. They taught me how to make a living and live a wealthy life. Is there any Institute or system where they teach practically how to live happily that too without losing control over the mind?

## Quotation105     
Education and Suffering     
     
Price and value are two different things. Price is that which we pay either time or money or invested emotions. Value is that which we get for that investment. If we perceive value is less compared to the price paid then we feel cheated. If we feel the price is too low we feel lucky or smart or both.     
     
What we pay for our children's education or self-education is the price and what they get is the value. That is why we generally say higher education is costly but worth it. But is that really true for everyone? We invest too many years and too much money in learning that which is required for survival but almost nil investment in that which is required to thrive all the time and places. If no investment then the value is also zero.     
     
What do you think is the cause of human suffering all around?     
     
#invest_in_valuables #invest_not_in_selfsuffering     
     
## Quotation106     
Price vs Value     
     
The process of overvaluing my own efforts and undervaluing others’ efforts is an inbuilt function in the human mind. No human is bereft of this component in their mind.     
     
A price is paid and a value is received. The price we know because giving something is hard and the price is something, which is paid. The value we know when we receive. It is perceived higher when it is received at a place where there is no hope. That is why water received in the desert and lovely spoken words from someone at far, unknown land wins our heart. But while living under the fountain of water or lovely people we don't know the value. This is one aspect of Maya and every human suffers from this more or less.     
     
     
## Quotation107     
Nirvana     
     
Nirvana Maarg is only for those who have woken up enough to the reality of life. Those who have faced enough and want to move to the next level of awareness in their living and not the next level of accumulation of Karma.     
     
Nirvana has nothing to do with how much money, power, network, comfortable environment, and lovely relationships we have. We have or have not, both are the same.     
     
Similarly, how much we have suffered or will suffer has no relationship with what we have and have not. The litmus test is this; can I live without those and without being crazily sad?

## Quotation108     
Human Relationship and Hell

नर्क एवं मनुष्य के सम्बन्ध     
     
सम्बन्धों में अधिकारों का जन्म।     
अधिकारों में आशाओं और अपेक्षाओं का जन्म ।     
आशाओं और आकांक्षाओं के पूर्ण न होने पर दुख और और क्रोध का जन्म।     
और जब दुःख मनुष्य के जीवन में पर्याप्त है तो मनुष्य नर्क के लिए इधर उधर क्यों भटके सम्बन्ध का नर्क ही पर्याप्त है।     
     
किसी अनजान व्यक्ति द्वारा की गई हर छोटी सहायता भी सुख और स्वर्ग की अनुभूति देती है। जब तक सम्बन्धों का नाम नहीं तब तक ही सुख एवं स्वर्ग बनते हैं नाम होने के बाद अधिकारों का दुष्चक्र शुरू हो जाता है। क्या किसी विवेकी व्यक्ति का जीवन अनुभव इससे भिन्न हो सकता है?     
     
## Quotation109     
Root Cause of the Suffering     
     
Some people say Kaam, Krodh, Madh, Lobh, and Maatsarya is the cause of sin. But based on my experience I can say this is just an excuse. The real problem is the magnetic nature of the mind. It attracts something very dearly like the north-south pole and rejects others like the north-north pole. It gets hooked or repelled by ideas, people, objects, and philosophies and this gives rise to Raaga and Dvesha. And this stickiness or magnetic behavior is the root of all that we experience and the way we experience the world.     
     
Kaam Krodha etc is unnecessarily hyped by moralistic people. It is part of human design. You can't say a car is good but it shouldn't have an engine.     
     
What do you feel?     
     
## Quotation110     
Human Capabilities and Machine     
     
Generalization, concluding fast, behaving as if I know, even when I know very little, and doubting when stakes are high are very favorite works of the human mind. If a machine has these capabilities then it is a good machine. The only issue is that a machine doesn't have a society so when they don't perform as per our requirements we throw them. But generally, this kind of behavior is not shown by any human to other humans.     
     
## Quotation111     
Generalization     
     
A Formula is a concept of generalization. Creating Sootra or formula takes an unimaginable amount of observation, data, energy, patience and time. But most of humanity tries to do it without putting enough time and energy. Why are we in such a hurry in concluding about anything and everything?     
     
## Quotation112     
Crazy Human Mind     
     
Stickiness of mind is like friction. You cannot say it is good or bad. Too much friction means no motion, zero friction means object in motion endlessly.     
     
Similarly if mind does not get hooked to anything it cannot achieve anything. Always wandering madly, anytime it can shift to another unrelated idea, it is not good. But, if it gets hooked and is not able to move away at your wish that is another problem.     
     
How many people in humanity know training for equanimity is possible. Most people become victims of this wonderful equipment called the mind. They go crazy to the limit that they need some psychologist. Some prefer not to go there in spite of madness.     
     
Some need shopping, some music, some talking, some TV, some newspapers and some other people to talk around or tasks to work upon.     
     
When one is with people then those may be driving him/her crazy. But, when alone then who drives a man crazy? The company of mind of self could have been most wonderful. But does that happen?     
     
## Quotation113     
Career Temptations vs Actual Passion     
     
If your society or government takes care of all your life needs like food, shelter, health, clothing then what is that which you would like to do to reciprocate that? Before going to sleep, make a log of what new things you learned today and what you want to learn and experience tomorrow. What is that action for which you can willingly wake up early everyday? As early you know this action, that early you start living a life on a new plane without any fear.     
     
Money is a measure of how timely and skillful you taped your hidden talent. And money can come to you even without any talent. It is never ever a measure of happiness and health. So applying mind and not getting swayed away with emotions to choose a balanced path is extremely important. Otherwise, like temptations traps rats you can be trapped.     
     
## Quotation114     
The Best is not the Best     
     
If you want to construct some really fantastic product or service then you have to consider all possible materials and inputs. Good and bad all can be used. It depends upon our creativity where we want to keep a particular good or bad thing in the product design. Whatever is created only from good or bad is a weak product. Take any kind of product or service either poetry or research or building or service like feeding the hungry, everything is made of good and bad.     
     
This crazy drive for becoming good, having good, seeing good, doing good is too much moral driven and impractical.     

## Quotation115
Holi 2022

Light of Diwali shows everything whatever is around you.

With your Vivekashakti (comes from your sincere efforts) you identify what is needed to live a peaceful and meaningful life. 

Fire (Holika Dahan) is to burn which is meaningless, a burden, rotten, sorrowful and negative.

This Holi May you get Viveka to burn all what is not needed for you to live a peaceful and purposeful life. For that don't lose your consciousness even temporarily. 

This Holi you may get color which absorbs everything but reflects nothing. 

Black is the color when all the colors of Holi are thrown upon you. May that, what is thrown upon you, help you to become a better person and experience a purposeful life.

Wish you a very happy and colorful Holi.

## Quotation116     
Hurting When you Don't Want     
     
What do you call those friends who want to teach you some lessons without giving you pain? But for that they take pain and suffer themselves, hoping that you will understand their pain and will alter your behavior. But what they overlook is that by doing so they may be causing more pain to their friend.     
     
## Quotation117     
Wise Spider or Human     
     
Spider weaves a web to catch some food for itself. But a human creates a web through his actions and finally gets caught in that. Finally loses all his freedom. And we say humans are the wisest creation on this planet. Alas! He never knows the difference between the action of Bandhan and the action of Mukti.     
     
## Quotation118     
Ganesh Worship in Hinduism     
     
In Treta, after Raama went to the forest. During this Uma took the test of the divinity of Raama. So up to treta Shiva and Uma have no child. Raama was in the forest for 14 years.     
     
After the test incident, Shiva rejected Uma as her wife, he went to samadhi. Uma put her body on fire and died. After this incident for many years, Shiva was in Samadhi and then got married to Parvati.     
     
So, all children of Shiva and Paarvati are after the Ramayana period. Hence, earlier parts of Vedas shouldn't have the traditions of Ganesh, Kartik pooja. It looks like later developments in our tradition or Ganesh, Kartik, Shiva, and Uma of Vedas are different.     
     
## Quotation119     
Time Creation     
     
Time is not any physical entity     
like space or objects in the space.     
It is a mental phenomenon.     
It happens there, wherever memory exists.     
It doesn't run with the ticks of our watch. That is just a tool to measure the time.     
     
The cyclical motion of objects in space is a reminder of time. The body cycle of sleeping, eating, flushing, etc are reminders of time.     
     
Through Yoga if you disrupt your body cycle, let's say, you eat once in a month, sleep once in a month for 10 hours, and remain in meditation for the remaining time then you can conquer the time to a great extent.     
     
Time runs inside the body which has memory. In a memoryless body, time is not possible. Akasha does not have a body so no memory hence Akasha has no time.     
     
## Quotation120     
A Fast Moving Train     
     
If you are sitting in a train which is running at a gushing speed of 1,10,000 km/hour. Your all relatives are sitting around you on the same train. There is an unwritten rule of this train, whoever comes inside can be thrown away from it at any point of time without taking permission from the relatives of the passenger sitting around. Now, one day, you find a close relative of yous suddenly disappears and all relatives assume this is the fault of the train owner. Are they wise?     
     
If these people start making permanent houses and relationships on this train then is that wise?     
     
The name of this fast-moving wonderful train is our earth. It moves in space at 1.1 lakhs KM /hour. We are cutting plots and selling apartments in this fast-moving train. But because everyone is doing it, it is considered normal.     
     
## Quotation121     
Watching your Mind     
     
There is a person in your society who cannot be ignored. Either you make him your friend or your enemy that choice you have. This person is hyperactive and can never sit for one minute without doing anything. Whether he will do constructive work or destructive work depends upon his own impulsiveness and the influence of his friends and enemies upon him.     
     
No one wants to have enmity with this kind of person. So we chose to engage with him and help him in doing some good karma.     
     
This is the state of the impulsive human mind. Even good karma is done because of the impulsiveness of our friend, called mind. Cannot we learn to tell this friend that there is no sleep, no Japa, and no physical, mental, or verbal karma for the next two hours? Remain near to me, I will watch you and you remain aware I am watching.     
     
     
## Quotation122     
Unsupported Warranty     
     
Religions sell the warranty of that insurance product (great heaven or horrible hell) for which you cannot come back and sue church fathers, priests, Mulla, Kathakaar, or pandits if the warranty is not honored. You just blindly believe and pay your annuity. Vedanta is selling that product, which people don't have time to look into.     
     
## Quotation123     
Who Am I?     
     
Whether we suffer or remain blissed out, experience is everything in life. Experience can be created using physical objects or just from memory and imagination.     
     
Experience of physical objects happens in a waking state.     
Experience of nonphysical objects happens in a dream state.     
Experience of nothingness happens in a deep sleep state.     
     
You experience your body. Which others can see and experience.     
You experience your mind. But, apart from you, no one in the world knows how you are feeling and what is in your mind.     
     
Don't fool yourself that you are sum total of your experiences. Apart from bookish answers, spend some time to know that experiencer.     
     
You can only 'know' that. You can never experience that as an experiencer. Because you are that non-physical.     
     
## Quotation124     
Consciousness in Deep Sleep     
     
Consciousness is like you see the sun in the nighttime from the earth. When you see the sky you say nothing is there, it is black, no experience of light, until some comet passes and you say I have seen. Comets don't carry light so how can you say that I have seen a comet if there is no sun in the sky?     
     
In the deep sleep state, there is no object to shine so we say there is no consciousness. But in reality, your consciousness creates the experience of nothingness, and post the sleep you say I slept like a log.     
     
     
## Quotation125     
Unprovable Experience     
     
You experience something. It may be because it is a truth, or out of your fascination, you created that mentally, or it is your capability to experience something unique. Whatever is the case, never shall we try to demonstrate our experience or experience something at the cost of our own life.     
     
Neither should we conclude something from observing the surroundings. It is good enough to believe as long as it gives support to your life and it maintains harmony with your surrounding. Sometimes the desire to experience that unprovable is life itself. But this happens when you live too much in mind.

CSR and Charitable Indian     
     
Which institution in the world, where you will get food no matter who you are?     
Which civilizations take care of birds and animals even if they are not your pet?     
Which institution in the world where you will get a place to spend your night without paying money?     
     
Which institution in the world, where the education giver is the poorest? Because, if you do not have wealth then society will take care of your every need and you will be given the highest respect.     
     
Unfortunately, quite recently because of western influences and terrorism this all is changing in a negative direction.     
     
## Quotation127     
Experience of True Self     
     
Since the last many centuries Vedanta has been trying to address that ignorance, which even the super geniuses of IQ 200 have. Ignorance of wrong self identification.     
     
But those who have known and experienced that 'the truth', either they become indifferent or are powerless to work and transform the societies around them. The nature of this knowledge is such that it can not be absorbed by a casual approach and hence at any point in time, there is an extremely less percentage of people who are one with the truth of existence.     
     
## Quotation128     
Adjusting Intensity of Mamkaar     
     
Generally Spiritual people think 'mamkaar' is the biggest cause of Samsaara and miseries. But if we observe the problem is different. It is giving high and low weightage, positive and negative to different Mamkaar. For example, in my mind, my body, my car, my daughter, or my son has higher positive weightage in terms of emotions, and compassion compared to other's daughter/son etc. Because one is called "my" and the other is called "his" or "theirs".     
     
As long as human life continues this Mamkaar will never go away because it is obvious in our physical existence. But he or she can work towards adjusting the positive and negative emotions along with the weight attached to the degree of emotions. It will bring Samatvam, an equilibrium to live unperturbed.     
     
## Quotation129     
Context Based Learning     
     
The biggest enemy of learning is to start learning without knowing the problems or challenges that the learning is going to solve.     
     
There is no dearth of teachers and trainers who wish to deliver whatever they know but they miss the point that serious learners are being murdered in the learning setup.     
     
So context setting must be a mandatory part of an education session whether school or college or corporate workshops. Otherwise, it looks like religious preaching or political speech which can be entertaining but serves not much value than a certificate and temporary entertainment.

Mindless Competition     
     
When we were in college, to solve a tough homework problem given by our teacher we all used to collaborate. For an individual assignment, we all work together and produce a solution. After that copy paste the same solution and all pass in the class. We were never competitors of each other, our enemy was not teachers or other students so we didn't mind discussing, sharing and copying. The only things against which we all stand together are tough problems.     
     
In professional life friends become competitors, managers become enemies, vendors become slaves, and customers become chickens to cut and exploit. And this causes suffering for all. Can there be better collaborative working rather than a competitive environment? The answer is Agile. Be playful, have fun, remain focused, work with customers, guide, and coach the team. But is it easy to break the old mindset and have a spirit of friendly sport rather than the deadly game?

All Time Honest is Impossible
     
It is not that our society doesn't have honest people or people of integrity. 99% of people are honest 1% of the time and the rest 1% are honest 100%. Challenge is, if you are in the 1% then you have to face the remaining 99% and it is difficult to remain unaffected 100% of the time.

Futuristic Education     
     
In the rapidly changing business environment because of technology, AI, ML, DL, RL, Quantum Computing, Industry 4.0, 5G, Automation, and robotics when we ourselves don't know what we will do after three years. That time we are asking our children 'beta bade hokar kya banoge'. Is it fair? Let them be a full-fledged life and if they are living fully they can figure out what needs to be done when the time comes.

Coaching Method     
     
As a parent or teacher or trainer, if you want to impart some knowledge, tricks, and technology then the best way is don't teach anything. But help the learners in hitting their own wall created by their existing knowledge, let them break that wall, and further with the least fear but discomfort let them swim their own ocean of ignorance. Once they travel in that dark zone, make sure you are available there for their guidance and help.     
     
Do you think the learner has this much patience to explore ignorance and the teacher has the patience to hold back his anxiety to share?

## Quotation135     
Language is to say what you don't want     
     
Truth is something that is experienced, seen, felt and your un-muddled heart knows. You need not speak. Language is a tool to hide what is in your heart. Sometimes you need to speak it much louder because people around are experiencing and knowing different things than what you are saying.     
     
Only innocent people use language to express the truth. For rest, it is a tool to hide the mind. Who is innocent and who is innocent all the time?     
     
When people say I love then don't go with words. Just know how you feel in their presence. Expressing by saying is a waste of energy, an awakened and un-muddled mind knows the truth no matter what others say. For an ignorant, sleepy, arrogant, lethargic mind nothing matters because it is wavering and muddy.

Educated People in Politics     
     
It makes me laugh when people argue that educated people are required in political systems. In the last 100 years, who has made a hell of a political system? Are Americans or British people less educated? Are Kerala and West Bengal people less educated? In spite of their high education do they have politics of high quality? Are our Rahul Gandhi or Arvind Kejriwal, MM Singh, Chidambaram, and Imran Khan any less educated? Do you want five-time Ph.D. holders in politics so that we can have better politics?     
     
What is required to serve the society and nation cannot be taught in school or college. And information which makes you smart is available on your smartphone.     
     
Politics is neither a job nor a profession. It is a full-fledged life. We need selfless, hardworking, impartial people who can see beyond the election, religion, nepotism, and party line. And you are saying higher education ensures this?     
     
## Quotation137     
Religions of 21st Century     
     
The biggest fallacy of accepting all religions preaching the same thing is if a new religion is also teaching the same old thing then what is the need for new?     
     
Because the old religion was for the people of that time, and god has sent a new messenger with the latest message. Therefore all old rules, messages, and books are invalid with the launch of the latest version of the Holy book. Hence no backward support and compatibility will be provided by god, so you must accept new. Because God cannot support multiple versions simultaneously, therefore, has authorized new prophets to convert old people. This way it legalizes conversion.     
     
Whether all religions are the same or not we need to understand every religion has some set of practices to manage people who cannot apply their minds. And it gives power to kings to rule over the masses.     
     
In the 21st century when democracy allows people to choose and practice whatever people want to practice, the authority of religious leaders and their relationships with politics doesn't make sense. But still, it will go on for another few years. After that? Either people will kill each other over religion or the world will have more sensible people who can live without religion and without psychologists. Simply blissed out of their own existence without waiting for the action to make them happy. The chances of the second are less.     
     
## Quotation138     
Genuine Seekers are Rare Breed     
     
Those who have muscles use muscles.     
Those who have a network use the network.     
Those who have read and heard a lot use words.     
For what? To win over others!     
These are different methods of terrorizing and subjugating others.     
     
What is the method of enlightenment?     
If people were really interested in knowing, experiencing, and living the truth then the world could have been different.     
     
People from political, religious, business and freedom-seeker groups blame each other for the deterioration of humanity but the truth is rarely anyone is serious about the goal of enlightenment. Most people are struggling for physical survival, others are struggling to dominate others.     
     
## Quotation139     
Friendship with Good People     
     
If you are a people manager then never let go of your good people, for their petty mistakes. Do not make everything serious in life. In life, we all make mistakes sometimes unknowingly and other times take risks and go against our friends, bosses, customers, and our Consciousness also.     
     
If you let people go then you waste a lot of time redeveloping new people and relationships. So your whole life goes in this or you remain alone.     
     
If you are working on a larger mission for society or your organization then forgive people and let them live comfortably around you, even if some mistake happens.     
     
But never compromise for fools. Having a fool as your friend or part of your team is life long pain. Let them go happily as early as possible without making it much bitter.     
     
Fool as a friend or as an enemy is a headache in both cases.     
     
But to know who is a fool, and who is wise for that you need to be a contemplative, introspective, and sincere student of a university called life.     
     
## Quotation140     
Should I Pray for Atheist     
     
If you don't have any value for my action then shall I do that action for you?     
     
My many atheist friends, neither believe nor experienced God nor God in their life. Nor do they believe or experience the existence of cosmic intelligence. Then, why should I pray for them and wish for them? For them, this all is meaningless because there is no God who fulfills my prayer.     
     
But I still do this. Because I know, it purifies my mind and intellect. This kind of selfishness is good.     
     
## Quotation141     
Actions to Freedom     
     
In our waking state we engage, willingly or by force, in different kinds of thinking, speaking, working, breathing, eating, and expressing activities.     
     
Meditation is the art of not doing anything at any level or minimizing your doings or doing only one thing willingly for a defined period of time. This way you move from compulsive living to freedom.     
     
Freedom is not that, you do whatever you want to do and then run away from the consequences of that doing. Freedom is that you choose wisely what you want, then do that in full awareness and finally be ready to live happily with the consequences of your actions.     
     
## Quotation142     
Democracy becoming Dictatorship     
     
Unanimity means when everybody agrees then only we will do certain things. But if one doesn't agree and we are not able to do that important thing then isn't this autocracy of that one?     
     
Hence what looks like the extreme end of democracy, beautiful, kind, and caring for even one, it is near to the dictatorship of that one who is against it. When we want to accommodate all viewpoints in a democracy we should be careful that it shall not become an ugly dictatorship.

## Quotation143     
Reality vs Our Experience     
     
There is Dukhha in the world and Sukkha as well. But till the time I am in deep sleep or unaware nothing matters. In Awareness, if I think the world around me is happening as per my values, moral principles, and desire then I see Sukkha in every happening of the world, else Dukhha in that same world. But we know the world never happens as per our wish it happens the way it wants. We just associate ourselves with those happenings.     
     
Searching in or associating your existence with Dukhha or Sukhha is 100% your choice no outsider can influence that. The dominance of Prakruti Tattva inside your own existence is responsible for seeing what you see around you.     
     
No matter how heinous or pious actions you see around you, you feel good or bad. It depends on what you like and what not. It has nothing to do with the act itself.     
     
## Quotation144     
What you think Good is your Good     
     
If I see good then the world doesn't become good. If I see bad things then the world doesn't become bad. It is the way it is without my labeling. If you don't like something then work to change that but understand your every action towards your so-called goodness is towards the badness of someone else in society. There is nothing absolutely good or bad. Desire comes out of collective consciousness matters and that only happens. It causes pain to others who don't feel part of that collective consciousness.     
     
If you are too sad because of the events around then watch around what is the collective consciousness of society, what it wants, and align yourself or work hard against all to change that choice is yours.     
     
## Quotation145     
Nothing is Absolutely Good or Bad     
     
Even the most essential thing of life called water is not good in an absolute sense. Time, place, and situation in which you receive, face or see something decide whether it is good or bad for you.     
     
Keeping any object in mind, visualize the contrast of time, place, and situation and the word 'absolutely' good or bad will vaporize away from your dictionary of communication.     
     
For the time being, think about water as follows. Flood, desert, thirsty, drowning in a river, need to take bath, offering water to some dearest person, offering water to a terrorist or thief who entered in house, wet bed, water in paddy fields, your gold ring washed away in river water, etc.     
     
Writing and singing poetry in appreciating or critiquing something is different and fun but the reality of life is not that straightforward.     
     
So nothing is absolutely good or absolutely bad. In the context of time, place, and circumstances people, ideas, and things are relatively good or bad.     
     
     
## Quotation146     
Negative or Positive Energy     
     
Heat or Energy is neither negative nor positive in the real sense. With respect to a system, you can say it is negative or positive. Emotion is energy. There is a spectrum of emotional energy in us. At one end it represents extreme selfishness and at the other end, it represents Aham Brahmasmi.     
     
At any given moment, at whatever end our mind is living, our energy gets labeled like that. Breathe deeply, live in full awareness, and watch to which part of the emotional spectrum your energy is flowing at that moment.     
     
     
     
     
## Quotation147     
Having and Being     
     
No matter how hard we work, where we live, what we hold in our bank accounts, keep in our surroundings or in our hands. Our true earning is our suffering or bliss with which we live every moment of our life. Every other earning is like a shadow. 

Fortunately, all humans are capable of creating this suffering or bliss without physical means.     
     
## Quotation148     
Superficial Life and Fear of AI     
     
People are worrying too much about Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its impact on human life.     
     
When we already are living too much artificial life (AL), which is quite away from the natural way of living, then why worry about AI in AL?     
     
We need to ask ourselves what is natural in us from our laughter, smiles, cries, sitting, sleeping, talking, helping, transacting, eating process, food, office space, living space, and everything that is more artificial and less natural. So don't worry we are already immunized.

Who Makes Your Life Hell?     
     
Who can force me to see the negative, if I have resolved not to see it?     
     
Who is that who can force me to learn, if I don't want to learn?     
     
Who is that who can force me to take some good or bad action, if I have decided not to take any?     
     
Who can force my mind to create more options, if I have made my mind to surrender?     
     
We can work hard and strive to make our surroundings better but can we fix anything permanently in our children or spouse, society or office, friends, colleagues or foes, government or judiciary? If not then the only person who is cynical, critical, grumbling, and stopping to live life the way it exists is who? But still, people think it is the government, spouse, children, friends, and religion who are making my life hell.

Meaning of Responsibility     
     
     
Responsibility means the ability to respond to the surroundings.     
     
Every living being has this ability. Whether a dog or cow, All! It is different that human behaves like a cow or slave of circumstances and don't know how to respond when, so it happens unconsciously. Hence the world created around us is our unconscious choice and we suffer in this world and nothing else.

Glory of Sanskrit     
     
After 2000 years people living on this planet say that English was the language of Christianity and used in the churches by the priests and today it is dead because only a few people speak this. Isn't that the foolish conclusion of people after 2000 years? Similarly saying, Samskrut is a language of Hindus and it is used for praying to demigods, is foolish.     
     
Gone are the days of colonial rules, today lots of scientific work is happening in the English language, and this is the only reason it is most respected. Samskrut held this place for a very long time in the Indian subcontinent. It is very unfortunate that people think it is a language for singing, chanting, prayers, and religion. Many people cannot read Greek and Latin but it doesn't mean the significance of those languages can be ignored. There are still some scientific minds, who try to learn those languages for their work. Knowledge has been extracted from ancient western languages and translated into English. But that has not happened yet from Samskrut.

Ability to Question Makes us Human     
     
Human is intelligent-being not because he remembers so many things, vomits those in front of a class teacher or in front of an innocent person, and can argue endlessly on anything in favor or against. Our memory is of no use if we cannot ask questions objectively till the time we reach the depth of a subject.     
     
So we are called intelligent because of our ability to question. We need to work hard to create this kind of machine that can ask deeper, meaningful, and provocative questions rather than just following books and traditions without understanding the intent. But there are innumerable people who are believers in so many things and they have lost their ability to seek the truth of their existence. The absence of quality to questions is at the root of this paralysis.

Living with Awareness     
     
From the awareness perspective, there are two ways of living.     
Way 1: observe/listen, believe, pray, fear/love, wait, cry/laugh, blame/thank, and die.     
     
Way 2: observe/listen, ask, seek, know, experience, witness, play, thank, and die.     
     
The choice is 100% in the hands of humans.

The answer lies in opening and reading Samskrut literature and you will find around 30% of the compositions are done by women. But in western culture, if you do the same survey then the answer you get is almost zero.

Knowledge Must Be Realized     
     
What is the use of knowing that I am Atman, eternal, fire cannot burn me, water cannot wet me, weapons can cut me, air cannot dry me? This is not even knowing it is like some information on my computer's hard-disk wasting harddisk memory and of no use. Better delete that file so that memory is free for other purposes! Isn't it?     
     
When information and knowledge don't lead to change in our behavior and the way we live then it means it has not been meditated and assimilated enough and more time is required for that. But when?     
     
If we truly have assimilated that concept of Atman of Vedanta then why do we live and behave the way we do? There is no shorter course than telling you that "you are That Ultimate Brahmin, cause of all causes". Even after that people look for more shortcuts and keep running to be happy.

Travel into Chidaakasha     
     
How to experience the world the way it exists without us? 

You keep aside all kinds of emotions, dogmas, bookish knowledge, and thinking for some time. 

Experience “the existence” as you are without eyes, ears, nose, skin, tongue, and mind. I know it is extremely difficult for most of humanity because our brain training from childhood has programmed us for outward travel so we have no conviction or experience of another journey. A journey not into Akasha but Chida-Akasha.

Yoga Nidra     
     
We all have experienced a place that is without space and a time without ticks of any kind. We enjoy that experience and we call that deep sleep. Unfortunately, that experience of bodilessness and timelessness in our day-to-day waking state happens to extremely few people.     
     
What happens if you work 18 hours every day and mentally you don't feel a need to sleep? Can we try bringing that state of existence to our living life? It is not possible till we don't stop holding our possessions, achievements, values, relationships, and duties in our minds and then experiencing them.     
     
It may happen to people in dreams but never in deep sleep. But how different is our living from our dreaming? We cannot know it, till we awake to another level of existence around us. But, how to do it? Can we go into a deep sleep and remain fully aware?

Following Books or Action in Awareness     
     
Generalization from observations and giving rules or commandments is the nature of the work of Rushis and serious scientists. This is documented in books. But an individual life sometimes goes as per those commandments and rules and many other times not.     
     
What is the relationship between optimism, taking risks, and foolishness? Books and advice from scientists and Rushis are helpful but No book or commandment can establish this definition for you.     
     
While living, every time you will get a new meaning of the event but for that, you need to step forward in full awareness and not in a half-sleepy state of mind. With that full awareness, you become wise which is beyond the dead words from the books.

In this information age information is used as a flower to make you happy, as a pin to puncture your mood, and as a bomb to destroy you completely.     
     
The biggest challenge is how to remain positive and inspired while consuming all kinds of information, that too without the aid of chemicals, alcohol, or medicine.     
     
If you love challenges then take a challenge in your life that no matter what people do or what happens around me, you will decide your mood without any external help. And understand one thing: we have come to an age where not getting information is not an option!

Demotivation means you are negative and against yourself. In today's time of the nucleus family of two or three people, if you are against yourself then almost 50% are against you, and in that situation, expecting the remaining 50% of people will support you is expecting a miracle.

I know that asking this from that supreme power is too much, normally humans don't have the strength to digest the truth which he or she doesn't like. So, humans will not listen even to God. Selective listening is a disease only for humans. Most of the time we listen to what we want to listen to. It doesn't matter whether that is fake or true. It is like music for the people.

## Quotation163     
Working with Smarter People     
     
If you don't want to work with less smart people than you. And you don't have the skills and resources to hire and maintain more smart people with less salaries. Then there are two ways to work, either work alone or take some employment. Entrepreneurship is not for you.     
     
## Quotation164     
Ideal Life to Live     
     
Life means animals, trees, insects, birds, mammals, and of course humans. Plants and fungi are also life but they are lesser life compared to those mentioned earlier.     
     
A way of living where all lives around you experience that you are harmless to them. And they know you are unharmable so they don't attempt to harm you but cooperate as you cooperate with them.     
     
That life is the ideal of life to be lived. Without violence, you cannot live but the maximum violence you do is pluck flowers from plants, fruit from trees, and vegetables from fields. Rest all other is unnecessary violence.     
     
     
## Quotation165     
Machine Model Training and Child Training     
     
Machine Learning Models are like children, so don't expose them only to the good things of life, otherwise, when they need to face the real world outside of your home they will fail in coping with society and disappoint you. If you expose them to too many negative examples then again they will fail because they start doubting everything. No matter how much data you have or how much you know, give the child/model equal examples/samples of good and bad.

## Quotation166     
Data Augmentation in Machine Learning     
     
When you don't have enough examples from your life experiences to teach children then you cook some stories to teach children but these stories should be realistic. If they are unrealistic stories then children may not know or object to your stories but after learning from you when they face the real world they fail and disappoint you.

## Quotation167     
Machine Learning and Maths     
     
Before the era of machine learning we didn't realize the importance of calculation, math, geometry, algebra, stats, and calculus. And now we think even God created this nature and natural intelligence using mathematical precisions and some algorithms. We are trying to duplicate this work in our data science labs.     
     
## Quotation168     
Infinite World     
     
This world came into existence from nothing because there was nothing before the big-bang. No mass, no gravity, no force, no light, no particles. Today most of our experiences are physical. That physical is created later from non-physical. That which is not a thing (God of religions) has become a thing (physical). That which is not a thing is infinite and as per experience, it looks the world around is also infinite. It looks like there is no boundary to the space in which physical objects are expanding.     
     
## Quotation169     
Yajnya     
     
Yajnya (यज्ञ) is a Samskrut term. The nearest meaning of this in English is fire sacrifice. But in Hindu tradition, Yajnya has a very broad meaning. In Bhagwat Gita itself, Yajnya has been discussed in detail. Apart from this, all the Vedas are full of Yajnya karma. In tradition even breathing, feeding someone, eating, and hardwork are considered Yajnya.     
     
     
## Quotation170     
Sloka     
     
Sloka (श्लोक) is the Samskrut word. The nearest word for this in English is a couplet. Mostly slokas are texts from scriptures not normal poetry. When we speak some sloka then a sense of purity is felt at the heart. This is not the case with couplets.     
     
## Quotation171     
Karma     

Karma is the Samskrut term. The nearest word for Karma in English is work or action but this is a very loose meaning. In Sanskrit and Dharmic traditions karma may be at a mental, verbal, or physical level using your hands and feet. In Indian culture when you suffer or enjoy we say you are going through your own karma. We say karma will chase you across 8.4 million lives and even after that till you don't get Moksha.     
     
## Quotation172     
Fala   
  
Fala (फल) is Samskrut term. The nearest meaning of this word in English is fruit, but this is a very loose meaning. It can also be associated with output, and result. Karma Fala, Rashi Fala, Aamra Fala are various usages of this word.     
     
     
## Quotation173     
Maya     

Maya (माया) is the Samskrut term. The nearest meaning of this in English is an illusion. But traditional Acharya and gurus explain it as "which does not have its own existence. But, its independent existence cannot be denied from the sensual perception point of view". Like a shadow of a person, an image of a person, seeing a snake on a rope in the darkness. Highest Maya is the Maya of God. Indian Vedic scriptures say that this world is maya of the God, we perceive it but it doesn't exist. Like we perceive sunrise but it never happens.     
     
     
     
## Quotation174     
Does Human Being Have Free Will?     
     
Some religions say free will does not exist.     
     
Some say only God has free will, without God’s will, nothing happens.     
     
Some religions say there is no free will for any life.     
     
Some say it is only for humans and it is always available.     
     
Some say it is for humans but you need to earn it with your Tapasya otherwise you are a slave of nature.     
     
Some say there is limited free will for humans and they can surrender that by not exercising it or allowing the government, advertisement/marketing agencies, society, and friends to think more and more about them.     
     
## Quotation175     
What is Mathematics     
     
Mathematics is not just about numbers, it starts with numbers. Neither it is nature's language. It is a human's language to understand the working of nature. Like, all humans can understand emoticons, all who are interested in deepening their understanding of nature and want to model the working of nature, learn mathematics. Books of physics are written using normal letters but the grammar is borrowed from mathematics.     
     
Without math, there is no physics. Without physics, there is no engineering. Without tools and engineering, there is no medicine. After this whatever is left is art. But that also you cannot do good without basic math or without the tools given by engineers!     
     
## Quotation176     
Thinking in Human vs Computers     
     
If a computer says I am thinking then what does it mean?     
     
Its speaker is echoing human words, and nothing more than that, like an empty hall?     
     
It is really doing something and taking time to process that, so telling the actual status.     
     
Is it trying to fool you while it is not thinking?     
     
Is it really contemplating the meaning of a word, sentence, or event, like humans do?     
     
Most humans think like computers, mechanical thinking. But AI scientists are working towards creating a computer that can think as any human should think.     
     
## Quotation177     
Love for Mathematics and Physics     
     
Generally people like music, art, and dance but not math or physics. Why? Because people live through art, music, and dance so it flows from their life, and people around them receive it like water flowing from a fountain.     
     
But the lovers of Mathematics and Physics have not learned to live with math and physics. So, most of these people look serious and dry. Not enough flows from their life that others can receive. Are Mathematics and physics really like that? The answer is a big no! Both are extremely beautiful in fact they can engross your mind much more than any music or dance can. It is a matter of a good teacher around or a deep zeal to learn by yourself.     
     
## Quotation178     
Test to know the Self     
     
Every object around us including our body has two kinds of properties     
physical properties like color, mass, density, shape, size, etc., and     
chemical properties like an object is poison, acid, base, the reaction of an object when mixed with other objects, etc.     
     
Therefore we have two kinds of tests: physical tests and chemical tests.     
What properties Atman has and what test you can perform to know the self?     
     
## Quotation179     
Human Compulsiveness     
     
You feel like rubbing your body parts, eating something, doing something, going somewhere, meeting someone, etc. You search a reason for that, and you do it. After doing that, you say it was my freedom and I did that. How different is it from your compulsiveness?     
     
Compulsiveness is slavery. Generally, people confuse this with their freedom.     
     
## Quotation180        
Cause of Pain and Suffering     
     
I am a body.     
Therefore I must have pain and comfort.     
And I can cause pain and comfort for others.     
     
I am a mind.     
Therefore I feel love and hate for others.     
Hence I feel enjoyment and suffering.     
And as a mind,     
I can cause enjoyment and suffering for others.     
     
If I know myself truly without body and mind     
then what pain, comfort, suffering, and enjoyment can I have?     
     
But people saying I am Atman. It is foolish and bookish.     
If people know they are Atman then     
Where is the place for these bodily and mental experiences?     
     
This is what Arjuna’s Friend says “Mithyachari”.     
Aachaar (behavior) of Mithya (that which seems but is not there).     
In plain English it is Hypocrisy.     
     
     
## Quotation181     
Method of Greetings in India     
     
Have you ever thought that in many millennia-old Indian civilizations, when Dutch, British, and Portuguese didn’t come to India; when we were not doing business with the USA; and we didn’t know what is the meaning of Aunt and Uncle; that time how our society was addressing and greeting some unknown person, children of a friend, parents of a friend, unknown women, unknown man, unknown child?     
Do you know, in Indian culture, from you to three generations back and three generations forward each relation from the side of mother, father, brother, and sister has a unique name?     
     
It is not as simple as Mom, Dad, Uncle, Aunt, Bro, Sis, BIL, DIL, SI, and "that new fellow"! Unfortunately, most of the people in the metro and cities may not be aware of this. And even in small cities and villages people are forgetting this and becoming woke.

## Quotation182      
Creating Infrastructure to Live     
     
It is less important for a human to live in a good house and with good people.     
     
It is more important to live in a good body.     
     
It is most important to live a wonderful mind.     
     
So invest your money and time in the construction of that which is most important.     
     
Rather than throwing time and money, which is less important.     
     
Know yourself what kind of beautiful mind I live in.     
     
Reconstruct a beautiful mind. Which is always joyful. No matter what happens around us.     
     
## Quotation183     
Fearless Living     
     
The worst thing that could have happened in my life has already happened, that was my birth. I was not directly responsible for that but it was ultimately a consequence of my earlier Karma, perhaps my Karma of my previous life couldn't liberate me.     
     
The best thing that can happen in my life is my final exit from this body. But I am not waiting for it, nor wishing for it, nor inviting it. I wish it must happen when the divine wants it. Because that would be the time of my complete liberation from every kind of entanglement. Until then I am busy enough to play and learn the new rules of play here.     
     
     
## Quotation184     
Eating     
     
At different stages of life and health you take various eating attitudes like the below.     
     
I eat whatever I like. For that I will travel far, spend whatever is needed and do whatever is required.     
I eat whatever is easily available to me. I don't put much effort into accumulating tasty things and do not run for food.     
I eat whatever is needed to keep my body good and running. I don't care what I like. I care for body maintenance.     
I eat whatever people around me want me to eat and drink. I don't have any control over my eating habits and food.     
I eat sensibly only when I am sick and doctors recommend me, otherwise, I don't care.     
I eat only what my dietitian recommends and I don't have any wisdom to run and maintain this body.     
     
## Quotation185     
House, Museum, or Tomb     
     
House is one that, which people construct to live in. Where people learn, laugh, cry, share ideas, argue, debate, meet, and live. People go out of their houses and invite others to live in their houses.     
     
The museum is where you dump lots of furniture and other stuff. No space to walk, sit on the ground or play around.     
     
A tomb is something that you want people to appreciate from the outside and feel jealous of. It is so comfortable that you don't want to come out of it. From here, you never go into nature or  to a friend's house to live. In fact, if you go you miss your own tomb. You want everyone to come to your tomb, pay respect and offer flowers and gifts. You cannot accommodate more people in a tomb, because you built that only for yourself. For a tomb you need land and it is always created on the ground.     
     
## Quotation186      
Living in Fear     
     
Laws of the land, ruler, and king create fear and people live sensible lives in public places.     
Fear of society forces people to live sensible lives in society and among the people.     
Fear of God, that He is watching us and He will punish me here or after death. It forces people to live sensibly all the time.     
     
If you are an atheist, you don't care about society, and anti-establishment then there are high chances you are a problem for everyone around you.     
     
Whether you are a theist or atheist. Have fear of any unseen power or fearless or careless. Only human consciousness, the ability to think rightly, or Vivekshakti drive humans to live sensibly all the time and without fear.     
     
## Quotation187     
Elasticity of Karma     
     
Karma is a much more elastic material than rubber. It can go to infinity and then bounce back to you no matter where you are at the time of bounce. So be very careful while handling this material at physical, mental, or speech level. It spares none and is ultra efficient in tracking you even if you change your place of living and body in which you did karma. It doesn't care about your donations, prayer, offering, or Gods it definitely hits back without exception.     
     
## Quotation188     
Leadership     
     
A leader may be a troubleshooter but more than that he helps people in defining their problem and finding their own solutions. A leader doesn't mean that, who has answers to all the questions. But one who can ask the right questions at the right time so that people think rightly, constructively and find their answers. Expecting all answers from leaders is not fair. Expecting followers to find their solutions is a trust of a leader on people's ability.     
     
     
## Quotation189     
Never Multiply with Negative     
     
When you face even the smallest negative no matter how positive you are, Never ever try to multiply. Otherwise everything will get messed up and Positivity of your whole life becomes negative immediately. Don't think mathematics is different from life.     
     
-0.001 \* 9,999,999. = -9999.9     
     
This is true in math and life.     
     
## Quotation190     
Real Living     
     
Till the time, an individual doesn’t come out of one’s psychology world, one cannot live into the existential world. People are too intense and full of emotions for their things, gadgets, pets, ideas, ideologies, accumulations and investments.     
     
## Quotation191     
Moksha     
     
Experientially knowing you have not taken birth and you will not die is Moksha.     
     
## Quotation192     
Existential Truth     
     
We don't know whether existential truth has gradations or not. But an individual’s experience, knowledge, has gradation. He projects his experience and knowledge on the truth and tries to convince others about his truth.     
     
## Quotation193     
What is Spirituality?

Someone, who is physically running too much every day. Spirituality means taking little rest to run better and faster than others. So, it is a tool to become the best Karmic person. Nowadays a corrupted word for that is Karmyogi.  

Someone, whose Manas is too sensitive and get disturbed even with small unexpected, undesired outcome in life. For him controlling his emotions is Spirituality, so that he can turn his train of thoughts always towards a positive tunnel. 

Someone, whose Intellect is thinking, calculating, assessing, and evaluating too much all the time. Spirituality means taking little rest so that he can think faster and better than others. Nowadays they call it, he is a smart or wise person.

If you ask Vedanta, they say knowing all the Physical, Manas, and Intellect level dances of your life are happening to you at the different levels of existence. But you are neither of those. That is spirituality. It means, experiencing (not knowing only) that I am Spirit, Atman, Nonphysical, Beyond Body, always existing Sat-Chit-Ananda.  
     
     
## Quotation194     
Death, Love and Meditation     
     
Truly speaking Death, Love and Meditation always happens in the present there is no future of these.     
     
Unfortunate people save love on camera for the future. Think meditation will happen one day in the future.     
Death will come in the future so don't think about that in the present.     
     
     
## Quotation195     
Knowing vs Realizing     
     
A man telling experience of pregnancy     
is like a philosopher saying     
I have experienced SatChitAnanda.     
Man can know but no experience?     
     
To experience SatChitAnanda     
one needs to go beyond knowing and philosophy.     
     
## Quotation196     
Light and Blindness     
     
How do you explain light to a blind person?     
     
Whatever the best method you try     
the blind person cannot know light through the words.     
     
Your telling him the experience of living in light will not help him.     
     
## Quotation197     
Same Experience is not Possible     
     
Seeing the same blue sky     
at the same time and place     
two twins will have     
different experience of blueness.     
     
Human brain is so complex that     
it is not possible to know whether     
same kind of neurological simulation     
giving experience of equal value to both.     
     
## Quotation198     
Silence for the Self     
     
Language is for communication     
between two or more people,     
when you are talking to self     
you don't need any language.     
Silence is enough.     
     
## Quotation199     
Arresting Time     
     
Taking picture, making movie,     
writing poetry are method to capture present and making it past but you can never do that successfully.     
     
Present can never be arrested,     
the moment you capture it is past     
and after this you will see that past in the future.     
     
## Quotation200     
Riverbank and Rever     
     
River has water and a river bank.

Human is like a river,     
know what is river and what is river bank in you.

of water in the river.     
     
## Quotation201     
Human Energy Flow     
     
Anger or love or lust are manifested forms of energy.     
In unmanifested form energy lives in you.     
     
When in anger or love or lust and you express it     
then there are two effects of this.     
First, you let go of your energy.     
Second, this will create a Karma and hit back at you.     
     
But, if you can retain this energy in you     
Then you stop the energy waste and avoid creating Karma.     
     
Question is, how to do this?     
Learn to go to the root of emotion.     
That root is formless, unexpressed.     
Now you can flow this energy into a new channel and benefit from it.     
     
But this is not easy, to start with you can start observing yourself when these emotions arise in you.     
     
## Quotation202     
What is Sin?     
     
The only sin of a humans is     
they have identified themselves as body     
and limited themselves in time and space.     
     
The price they pay for this is     
bondage of one lifetime.     
     
Humans lost eternity and     
became slave of objects, circumstances and nature.     
     
## Quotation203     
How to Stop Mind?

But the mind keeps doing activity.     
     
No activity can stop the activity of mind, except observing the self.     
     
## Quotation204     
Relax by Being     
     
Life is like weighing machine,     
when we are in more state of doing     
then we exhaust ourselves,     
when we are in a state of being then we relax.     
     
But our life is so much outward     
that we know how to "do"     
but we don't know how to "be".     
Hence most of the time we want to relax by doing! But this doesn't work.     
     
## Quotation205     
Busy Even in Dream     
     
Dreaming is your mental activity,     
it is in continuation of your physical activity.     
     
You have so many desires and goals     
and for that you keep doing activity     
and when you go to bed     
your mind continues those activities.

you are helplessly busy doing.     
Where is the time to "be"?

Useful Madness     
     
An Einstein or a Van Gogh or a Ramanujan

either their madness is harmless     
or their madness is utilitarian.     
     
     
## Quotation207     
Slavery of Master     
     
You can only be a master

Blind person doesn't have this option.     
     
## Quotation209     
EyeBall Movement     
     
When eyes are open, they respond to external color, shape and forms. Eyes chase the objects, color, shape, forms in the world.     
     
When you are dreaming and eyes are closed     
Then why does eye ball movement happen?     
     
Science tells us only mind sees and eyes are just cameras.     
While dreaming, the eyes (camera) does not turn inside to see.  Neither any projection from the eyes required.     
     
     
## Quotation210     
Who is Watching Dream?     
     
If dream is your movie inside your brain    
Then what is the screen     
on which this movie is projected?    
 
Who is that who watches this movie     
when you are completely unaware about     
the physical body and logical mind is absent.     
     
## Quotation211     
You are not a Body     
     
If you can see your body totally from the inside, then you can never fall into the illusion that you are the body.     
     
You always see it on the wall mirror, from outside, and you keep thinking I am a body.     
     
## Quotation212     
Truth cannot be Said     
     
Lao Tsu said that the nature of existence is such that which can be said cannot be true,     
and that which is true cannot be said.     
     
If in doubt then try to speak     
about the deepest existential truth.     
All of sudden you will become silent.     
     
Don't confuse your memorized facts, or relative truth with existential truth.     
     
## Quotation213    
You are not Past or Future
 
Take a deep breath and experience     
you are one who is living at this moment.     
     
And not the one who lived in the previous hour nor that who will live in the next hour.     
     
For the time being, keep your memories and imaginations of all kinds aside.     
     
## Quotation214     
Going Beyond Mind     
     
If you use your mind you cannot go beyond it, because the very use of the mind will strengthen it. It will make the mind more powerful. When you use your mind, you will be in its clutches. Using it, you cannot go beyond it.     
     
## Quotation215     
Man vs Machine     
     
If you are struggling to know     
what is the difference between Machine and Man     
then the following may be helpful.     
     
More predictability, routine, fixedness, rigidity, process, patterns, and morally correct, more that is a machine.     
     
More it has randomness, uniqueness, local practice, celebration, the ability to rebel or love, don't care about your mortality and laws more that is a life.     
     
Unfortunately, our education, society, and government expect us to become more and more machine because then we are more in their control like any machine is in the control of the owner.     
     
## Quotation216     
Nature of the Existence     
     
The nature of existence is such that we cannot see the whole of even a small grain at any one time.     
     
You try to see one side of the grain at any time and to see the other side of the same grain you need to wait till the next moment.     
     
We live in this kind of world where knowing from 360 degrees, inside and outside and all the time is impossible.     

## Quotation217         
Mind Prism     
     
When a ray of light enters the prism     
It is divided into seven colors.     
The mind works exactly the same way.     
When a ray of existential reality enters into it, It creates duality.     
And our whole life we keep classifying     
events, people, circumstances and things     
under this prism of mind.     
Without knowing there is some     
colorless ray before the prism.     
     
     
     
## Quotation218     
Breath and Birth     
     
Inhale is birth, Exhale is death.     
We inhale by our own will and efforts,     
but exhale is done by the body.     
So every birth (inhale) happens because of our efforts.     
Death (exhale) is automatically happening.     
     
We are so much afraid of death,     
If people are given options they won't exhale.     
It means, we have a wish of not dying.     
     
In that case, there is no hope of the next breath (birth) without death (exhale).     
     
## Quotation219     
Karma cannot be Canceled     
     
Don't make the mistake of thinking     
Your Karma is like your food.     
So, the effect of spicy food     
can be canceled by consuming sweets.     
     
If you believe in Paap Karam and Punya Karma     
then each has its own impact,     
no one cancels out another.     
     
Even basic observation of the phenomenon world     
around will give you this understanding.     
But people are too busy in hearing     
and weaving stories that console them     
and they are not ready to listen to life.     
     
कर्मणो ह्यपि बोद्धव्यं बोद्धव्यं च विकर्मणः     
अकर्मणश्च बोद्धव्यं गहना कर्मणो गतिः     
     
## Quotation220     
Life, Death and Living     
     
If you know how to live during life.     
You will definitely learn how to live a post-life.     
The problem is people claim they are living but they are not.     
And then you see a fear of death on their face.     
     
Which death are you afraid of?     
What death can come to one     
who is dying every moment?     
They cannot laugh with full heart,     
If they want to laugh and enjoy themselves for some time     
then they need to consume some substance     
or watch laughter TV channels     
otherwise they have lost their internal ability 
to laugh and enjoy without taking external help.     
     
## Quotation221     
Conclusion about God     
     
Someone searched for God for thirty years     
and said to his Master     
I have become an atheist;     
now I do not believe in God.     
     
Master said just twenty years     
and you have the nerve to say that     
you have become an atheist!     
     
You should have taken some more time     
to reach a firm conclusion.     
In this short time, your this conclusion is hasty.     
People take many births to know the nature of existence and the source of creation.     
     
## Quotation222     
Love or Compromise     
     
When husband and wife can not sit together.     
Pray and meditate together.     
Appreciate some event or something together.     
     
Can not sit silently and look into each other's eyes.     
Don't agree about the goal and purpose of life.     
Then what Horoscope does our Astrologer tries to match?     
     
This has a heavy impact on society.     
We trust that professional     
who is doing his work with half heart.     
     
We can search millions of families     
But it is extremely difficult to find     
couples who respect, trust and love     
each other without putting any if and but.     
     
## Quotation223     
Don't speak     
1. When people are sharing their problems, just listen with as much attention as possible. You give solutions or not that can be seen later.      
2. When people do not want your help in solving the problem, they want to share.     
3. When someone is in anger before you.     
4. When someone didn't ask for any suggestions and you tempt them to give them a suggestion.     
5. When you encounter a powerful, bullish, and half-informed person.     
6. When you don't know fully there is no wisdom in opening your mouth and saying I know.     
7. When someone is criticizing some third person in the absence of the third person.     
     
If you speak in the above situations you will lose your peace of mind.     
     
Silence is a great teacher just sit near him and listen to him.     
     
     
## Quotation224     
Purpose and Limitation of Languages     
     
Language of experience is silence, dance, flow, painting, wordless music, etc.     
     
The language of knowledge is Sanskrit, English, Chinese, or any local language.     
     
The language of the electronic machines is c, java, python, pascal, c#, etc.     
     
These are different planes of languages and every plane serves some strong purpose. Overuse is when we try to communicate something of one level, using the language of another level.     
     
You are bound to fail when communicating experience using languages like English, Hindi, Sanskrit, etc., or trying to communicate knowledge using the language of dance or silence. Or communicating with a computer using languages like silence or English or dance.     
     
## Quotation225
The curse of Knowledge 

Because of your knowledge you see things differently. You impose labels of your knowledge on everything you have seen or dealt with earlier. Just because your brain has learned certain patterns therefore other people will see that same pattern, that won’t happen. Just because you see a duck doesn’t mean that others won’t see a rabbit. From a scene you understood something, others can understand something completely different.

This is the curse of knowledge, because it is difficult to turn off your own knowledge, to see the world through another person’s lenses. Sometimes, those who are most familiar with the data are the least helpful in determining whether a message is clear.
  
     
## Quotation226     
Sickness and Prescription     
     
You ask the doctor about your health because you are sick.     
You ask a dietician what to eat because you have lost the sense of what to eat and what not.     

You ask others what is inside me and people give answers like you have Atma, Soul, Spirit, etc, which means you are not healthy and not in touch with yourself. In this situation whatever answer others give is not going to help. What will you do with that prescription of Shastra or Guru or Wiseman, especially when you respect these things but don't have the honesty to work and know that from your experience?     
     
Sickness is when you need to ask others about yourself. The danger is more when you don't follow a good prescription.     
     
## Quotation227     
Human Suffering     
     
Humans don't suffer because of bad luck but because of their desire to enjoy. Till you keep your desires to enjoy, even the god of death cannot kill your suffering. Enjoyment and suffering are the same things, like two sides of a single coin. Sometimes you see one side and other times you see the other side of this coin.     
     
## Quotation228     
Free Will     
     
You have free will but your day-to-day decision doesn't reflect this truth. Therefore you have to put some time and effort to realize and then exercise your free will. In the absence of that, you are a slave of TV advertisement, culture, traditions, and conditioning     
     
## Quotation229     
Working with Heart and Head     
     
Do whatever your heart says. But before that get all the facts and analysis done.     
     
If you are using your heart as a replacement for the mind then it will cause lots of guilt when things go wrong.     
     
If you are using your head in replacement of your heart then you cannot complete any action happily.     
     
## Quotation230     
The will of the universe     
     
Human wants to do something     
But due to some reason it could not be done     
or the result could not be achieved as expected.     
So they say, whatever happens, happens for good.     
Hence this concept of one universal Will is being used to hide incompetency and weakness.     
     
In reality, what is being said is the Cosmos is more intelligent than your intelligence. Therefore whatever is happening is as per cosmic will.     
     
Now after seeing the result of your action, whether you are happy or not, you must understand individual happiness and individual will is meaningless in this cosmic existence.     
     
It is not good because you failed and god has some better thing for you. It is good because that is how it should happen and good for all.     
     
## Quotation231     
Free Will 2    
     
If we know we have free will then why are we miserable?   
  
If we know we are slaves (do not have free will) then what has made us slaves? And whose free will can make us free?     
     
A fish dying thirsty in the ocean is laughable or miserable for an observer? A man is free and bound by his thoughts. A physical body kept in a physical jail is understandable and it takes physical strength to come out of that jail. But one who is jailed in his own thoughts of slavery how to free him? In that case, either mentally break the wall and experience your free will or go to sleep where you stop thinking. There is a third way also, what is that?     
     
## Quotation232          
The Purpose of the Human Body 

The purpose of a car is to take a passenger from one place to another place.
If a car does that work efficiently and you feel pleasure while sitting or driving the car then the purpose of the car is served.

If you fill the car with the wrong fuel, don't do routine maintenance, use the car for the wrong purpose, driving wrongly then the car will still run.
If you put airplane fuel in the car, spend too much time and money caring about the car, drive very slow, don't let it go on dusty and rough roads, all the time thinking about the car and its shining, rarely drive your car and put that mostly in AC garage then also the car will run.

Too much care and too much carelessness, not using the car for the purpose it is built for and using it for the purpose it is not built for, all are the wrong usage of the car.

The human body is extremely complex and it can help you experience something extraordinary. Unfortunately, people waste their whole life earning, maintaining, and keeping this body in a great house and then other bodies around that they don't know the real purpose of the Human body.

No matter how much your education, how much power you have, or how much wealth you have, you may still be miserable if you have not known this purpose.

## Quotation233  
Living the Purpose of the Human Body

If you understood the purpose of the human body from your religious books, sadhu, saints, pandit, maulvi, priest, and scholars then what would you do? You won't Work for the Purpose of the Human Body!

Why? Either you don't believe or don't have a conviction or by seeing their faces you feel it is not worth doing, or you feel it is not humanly possible, or you have other priorities in life. You want to pass some toughest exams, get a great job, get married, have an EMI free big house, buy a farmhouse or Iceland, have children, get children married, become an owner of an MNC, become CM or PM of your state or country. 

You are so busy in this small life that you have taken work for thousands of years in your hand. When you face death you say, I have not started living yet, I want to live more. What will you do even if you get another ten years to live? No matter when you face death you will say I have not started yet.


## Quotation234 
Size of Body and Intelligence

Suppose there are dinosaurs living on this planet and they are as wise as you are. How will they treat you? The way you treat ants!

You don't bother how many ants are killed when you walk or drive, you don't bother about their children, family, society, religion, house, food, health, etc.

It is just because we are larger than many other creatures and smarter than many large size creatures we stopped thinking about other creatures.

Not only that we created our religion, nation, and identities for which we fight and kill other humans.

And we call humans wise. It really puzzles me.


## Quotation235 
Food Taste vs Food Wisdom

On vegetarian and non-vegetarian diets debate. It surprises me how smoothly non-vegetarians exclude insects, maggots, compost fertilizers, and stones from their definition of life. It is true that consciousness and life is in all and everywhere.

It is not a matter of choice of food but a choice that is rooted in ignorance. Humans hide and want to live because of their food tastes or preferences or religion or identity problems.

Interestingly this ignorance applies to most vegetarians as well. Most of them feel disgusted or have taste or religious problems, and not because of Dharma or compassion or letting others live philosophy.

Where is the wisdom about food? Where is the compassion?

## Quotation236
Identity Creation

For all creatures, life and their survival is the most important thing.

But a human has two equally important things to protect for his survival. One is his life and the second is his identity.

When survival is taken care of then humans go madly after creating and protecting their identity. This identification with the nation, religion, culture, traditions, gender, family, philosophy, leaders, ideals, etc is good if it helps the human in improving the quality of all lives on this planet but seeing this identity problem makes us crazy, irrational and we do more damage.

And all identity problems start with identifying yourself as a body. This is the starting point of all identities. At this initial stage of identification can we experientially identify ourselves with something else?


## Quotation237 
Busy life and freedom 

There are few people, when they are busy, they can do multitasking and they don't feel any stress even in intense activity. 

But when they are free and sitting then they don't have time even to remove mosquitoes biting on their face. In that state other people think they are free why cannot they meet us, talk with us or at least remove mosquitoes from their faces? But in that state, this kind of person doesn't even know they exist in a body which others think is a workless free sitting person.

Can you learn to enter into that state of extreme busyness when you experience that even taking more breathing per minute is a waste of time?

## Quotation238    
Dussehra 2022

The good thing about Dussehra is, it reminds us that there are good and bad in human behavior.

We all know what is good and what is bad. Of course, it is our own relative good and relative bad. We all want to increase the good and wipe out the bad.

The bad thing about this festival is We celebrate this festival outside And want to grow good and kill bad outside. And, it is never going to happen. In fact, just the opposite happens.

If you doubt then ask yourself How many Dussehra celebrations you have seen Since you are enjoying festivals, And how much good has come in the society?

May this Dussehra all thinking individuals celebrate inside. Happy Vijay Dashami.
     

## Quotation239     
Saint or Politician

If you want to rule none but yourself then you are a saint.
If you want to rule over others then you are a politician. Politicians may be a mother or a father who want to rule over children. They may be grandparents who want to rule the entire family. Or Village Pradhan who wants to rule the entire village. And you know other bigger politicians.

Do you want to rule yourself or rule over others?

## Quotation240   
Fear of Death 

Nobody is afraid of death. There are two kinds of people.
Those who want to see death and do all dangerous things, that bring them near to death. They have fun with death.
The second category of people is those who are scared of living.

One in a millennium somebody really gets scared of death and becomes Buddha. So scared that he wants to understand and solve this mystery. Siddhartha was that person who could see death happening to himself. An ordinary person sees that death is happening to everybody but not to him. This is the reason, in this Dharmashala called the world (Samsaara), people live like they are living in a permanent house. They behave like they are eternal beings here.

## Quotation241   
Human Looks for Slavery

When someone imprisons us we rebel for freedom.

When we are free we are looking for jail. There are several sweet names for this jail. It may be a home for the homeless, marriage for a bachelor, a job for the jobless, children for the childless, shelter for a wanderer, company for a lonely, guru for a seeker, or teacher for a student.

Home, marriage, job, children, shelter, company, guru, and teacher binds you. When you don't have these then your pray for getting these. But. when you have these you want the freedom to think, act, live, and breath.

## Quotation242   
The World is Complete

Shishya: If there is God in the world then why there is so much evil, helplessness, war, fight, and poison in the world? Why do you expect mercy from humans when God is merciless and cruel?

Guru: Suppose there is God and He removes darkness then will you know what is light? He removes coldness then what is hot? If he removes the enemy cat then will you be happy with all rats around? If he removes all enemy peacocks will you be happy with all snakes around? If he removes all the sickness then will you eat sensibly, talk sensibly, and behave sensibly? What will happen to your hospitals and doctors without sickness? What will happen to your courts and judges when people have compassion, What will happen to police and jail when there is no crime? What will happen to teachers when students are wise?

O Pratibimba, the world is made of duality and it is perfect. God is neither cruel nor merciless nor compassionate nor foolish. You drink or eat poison then expect the effect of that upon you. This drinking or eating can happen in various ways. Don't complain, learn to watch this properly and smile at your complains.

## Quotation243
Morality to Control People     
     
The business of morality is forced by powerful people, business owners, pontiffs of religious organizations, high position political and bureaucrats to ensure they work peacefully in their position, accumulate more power, money and grow more. But who can accept that talking and doing these high morals should be in my life first when I am not in power. Unfortunately, if you think this way then it is not possible to get the position of power.   

## Quotation244   
Karma vs words

Your words are useful till the time you are not doing something against or in support of your words. Once you start doing something then people don't listen your words they see your Karma. And not doing for a long time is also a doing. You this action is also watched.

## Quotation245
Don't Suffer 

Don't suffer like an ordinary person.
Don't suffer like an extraordinary person.
They both sing the glory of their suffering and want to become Hero before God or Hero of masses.

No matter what you do or become or achieve, learn to live without suffering. Even without gods of heaven, the society you live in, you exist.

Is it possible for an ordinary person that he doesn't suffer? Yes, but then he is neither ordinary nor extraordinary person. He becomes wise in the internal sense of living and society will not notice that. And it is not important for him.

## Quotation246
Kind of People & Their Suffering

On the plane of Karma there are 4 kinds of people.

Type 1 are those who could do something in their life which they think was worth living. They keep doing it without bothering about the consequences or rewards.

Type 2 are those who work hard in their life to achieve something which they think will give them glory, wealth and respect.

Type 3 are those who do which they copy from others, thinking this will give them comfort and  happiness.

Type 4 are those who don't want to work but want the good Karmafala of that karma which is not done.

Type 2, 3, 4 are normal people in life, because most of humanity is like that. Every life suffers in one way or other way, but can you choose not to suffer the way normal people suffer?

## Quotation247
Investment and Returns

Whatever we accumulated minus what we invested  is our return on the investment (ROI).

We always want our ROI to be the highest otherwise we will be considered less wiser or even foolish.

Our investment in our misery is so high that we pray that our investment should not fail. Without knowing that failure of this investment will bring happiness in life.

You can count where you have invested your time and money. Listening or writing sad songs/poetry, or glorifying pain and suffering, or thinking suffering is good (because god is testing your ability), or buying housing in the middle of the city, or having a relationship with the most handsome or beautiful person, or having relationship with powerful politicians and businessman, or having unique thing at your office or home, or too much time or money in nurturing a relation or client, or giving too much value to youth and beauty. They will all create a sense of insecurity, fear of loss in you. You may not know it explicitly but it exists in the deeper layers of your consciousness.

## Quotation248
Bodies and Their Food

Physical body needs physical food.
Mental body needs mental food.
Intellectual body needs intellectual food.

If you listen to these three bodies at their proper plane of existence you wouldn't mix up the food of these and take care of yourself.

There is a limit to consuming physical food because physicality has boundaries and boundaries define the limit.

Mental and Intellectual bodies are boundaryless. When people eat because they are hungry they listen to the physical body and address the physical need. But when people are tempted to eat or there is a time to eat or social compulsion to eat then they are mixing emotional or mental desires and pumping their physical body. If they do it for too long then they will be in trouble.


## Quotation249
Why is he happy?

Simply because someone eats all kinds of food and does all kinds of karma and he looks happy doesn't mean it is a rule and you follow that. Similarly if someone is very disciplined in eating and drinking, does good karma and he is suffering it doesn't mean it is a rule and you do the opposite of him.

In nature there is something called normality and another thing is called outliers. This rule applies to everyone. In statistics type 1 error is when a person following a healthy lifestyle dies early or is often sick, type 2 error is when a person following unhealthy lifestyle survives a healthy long life. But both are outliers. In general if you have healthy habits you are happy and if you have unhealthy habits you suffer and not your neighbor.


## Quotation250
Philosophical Pessimism

I cannot help but feel the suffering all around me, not only of humanity but of the whole of creation. I have never tried to withdraw myself from this community of suffering. It seemed to me a matter of course that we should all take our share of the burden of pain which lies upon the world.

**There are all kind of philosophies. Life is full of choices it depends what you chose and create. Be aware of too much Optimisms and Pessimism. Don't just follow the quotes, pause for a moment, think deeper and ask yourself what is your truth.**


## Quotation251
Your Wishes are not Yours

A human can do what she or he wishes but they cannot wish what they wish. 

Whatever people think are their personal wishes, they are the wishes of society, religious or constitutional system. Human is not free to think till he is part of society, social media, and market place.

## Quotation253
Happy New Year 2023

From the uterus of Kaali (Creator)
Kaala (time) took birth and starts playing all around
Then from undying Karma, 
Life (physical bodies) came into existence
But most lives don't care about the Kaala.
Humans are conscious of their Kaala.
But, what do humans get by becoming busy and multi-tasking?

Humans are able to accumulate what they value.
But Kaala takes back that, which humans earn in Kaala.
Can humans earn or experience that which cannot be taken away by any?
Most of humanity doesn't know this
Those who know don't believe and value this.
And human still earns perishable but his valuable.

When you are happy and busy doing what you like or value,
Then 365 days unfold like a blink of an eye.
Others feel a day is like an eternity,
where time doesn't start and stop.

In 2022 you earned something and lost something.
In 2023, may you get the wisdom to know what is valuable and what not
May you get the strength to know unperishable in and around you
May you get the strength to earn that
May you enjoy that and be one with that.

All the best for your next 365 days.
Those are starting today and we call it Year 2023.


## Quotation254
Destruction in Meditation

Shiva is the God of Destruction
But Shiva is always in Dhyanam (Meditation) in an extremely cold place.
How come a meditative mind goes for destruction?
How come cold is suitable for mediation?
Why can't our Rishi imagine that Siva is sitting near Sun and meditating?

This concept is very unique in Indian ancient scriptures 
and in the psyche of the Indian population that Shiva does destruction.
He puts ashes on his body and kills everything as soon opens the third eye.

But think for a minute
If you go into deep meditation then what happens? Samsara Naasham!
Your subjective world completely collapses there.
And the best way to meditate is to have minimal clothes on the body 
but insulated from the external cold and other sensations.

When the world is destroyed by previous Dhyanam 
Then use the Ashes of that destruction, 
Apply on the body and sit for the next Dhyanam 
you will be better insulated from cold.

Gradually learn to sit longer in Dhyanam. Too many clothes on your body or tight clothes 
don't allow you to go beyond your physical existence.

What is the Truth behind the concept of Shiva’s destruction? We don't know.
But there are several stories about Shiva, his work, and his lifestyle.
Different people understand that in different ways.

Your Shiva is that which helps you in your own Destruction.
Once you die then you learn to live like Shiva. 
Otherwise, you live like a creature and suffer like a creature. Helplessly!


# Quotation255 
The Concept of God

All words which humans use to define God are human-created words. 
All the arrangements of words are his own grammar and creativity. 
What God really is, humans cannot know or experience through words, 
intellectual debates, or even singing or dancing cannot reveal His true nature. 
Although these are helpful interim steps,
So whatever God human knows, 
it is his own word, knowledge, and concept. 

If there is no death and no fear then do you think, 
the concept of God is required? 
For most of humanity, 
Death and fear are the foundational stone 
of a building called God. 

There are a few who are interested in experiencing God 
beyond the human-created stories, 
That too, when they become fearless and deathless.
Most people want God as a tool to overcome their fear and death.


# Quotation256 
Education after 2023

With ChatGPT technology in full swing,
Teachers do not have anything to teach.
Students can write the best notes and best answers.
Hence teacher will need AI to evaluate the answer otherwise 
Human Teachers may end up giving 99 out of 100 to every student.

Now our education system will learn 
the purpose of education is not to fill the mind with information 
It is not about how much you know or memorizes, 
How great an answer you can give.
But the purpose of education is learning.
And you need a different kind of system to evaluate the learning.

Up to this point in time, if a student answer MCQ correctly 
you don't know if it is by guess or
if a student really has learned the concept. 
But institution grants a degree.

If a student couldn't write a good answer 
because of language issues or comprehension issues, 
or health or emotional issue at the last moment 
then you cannot say the concept is not understood.

In the future, if a student is writing a good answer 
It may be that he has taken help from chatGPT.
So our Education sector and Skill Development institutions 
are going to see a big change.

Emotional Machine

People say AI and robots do not have emotions and do not feel like humans feel joy, love, suffering, and pleasure. It is not a question of whether we can create an emotional robot or not. After realizing that Maths and Statistics really work very well, we can create those machines. The real question is who will buy those robots, that throw tantrums like your partner, children, bosses, and subordinates throws? Are you not already fed up with biological machines that you want to invest in silicon machines and suffer?

Talking is a time waste if there is no trust between the parties engaged. To build trust we need to do more than talk.

If you have access to people then stop talking and start getting information from indirect sources is a lack of trust and respect. You may know all the information about others from indirect sources but it will not help directly in building trust.

Those who have Vidhya get money. Those who don't have Vidhya get money. First Vidhya is about the art and science of earning money. The second Vidhya is Atma Vidhya, knowledge of the Self.

If you don't speak I cannot listen. If there is no silence I cannot listen. 

Too many words either by the same person or a different person is noise. Absence of any word is silence. We can draw poem, utterances and noise from silence. Silence is mother of all what can be spoken and listen in past present and future.

People are slave of habits. Habits enables their unconscious living. Break all the habits good or bad. Come to present, be aware of your breath till you are breathing. 

With good habits you get the Sansara of luxury, wealth, pleasure and healthy body. With bad habits you spoil relationship, health, wealth and invite miseries. But when drop all kinds of habits you don't get anything. You reach to the self and start conscious living.

When you really enter into the state of being then What you have, how much you have, where you are, what quality are your possession of, matters none.



Every Karma has its fala. Hence we do Karma to get that fala. While choosing your career or business keep in mind if you get all the results which you wanted from this Karma will you still do that work? If you say then don't go on that path then don't start today on that. If you say I will still do the same Karma to get more fala then don't do that. Fala is driving you whole life is not good. Karma drives you is fine.


The question of where God is wrong is because where means location on a map or land. If you can locate that in a piece of land or map then that is not omnipresent God.
