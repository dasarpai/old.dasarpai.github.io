In draft folder I can change date of file, late or early date.

Whatever I do, I have to do that inside, before publishing.

Every article has one id, it cannot be changed. Because corresponding to that id image number has been assigned and sometimes that image is already created. 
You can change that image but change file name of that image is painful. Because removing file with oldname etc is issue.

Create image using canva and put that in proper folder. In future based on the need, spelling can be changed.

whatever spelling change happens that need to reflected in the file name.

Checklist: Before publish any article make sure.
- Date filename and inside are same.
- permalink is correct
- image name is correct in teaser and header
- Alt of image is correct
- Heading is correct
