# Is Hindi Mother of All North Indian Languages?

To answer this question, we need to understand that, in a cultural sense, a mother is the one who gives birth to a child; therefore, the child comes later than the mother. Keeping that in mind, Hindi is the daughter of many North Indian languages. Let's explore that a little further.

Keep one more thing in mind: Tamil and Sanskrit are among the oldest languages in Bharat. People may debate their dating and argue which came earlier and which came later. However, one of the oldest living languages is Tamil. Sanskrit, on the other hand, has largely been preserved in temples, scriptures, and certain rituals, as it has been replaced by other modern languages in everyday use.

## **Summary of Evolution of Languages:**  
**Sanskrit → Prakrit (500 BCE) → Apabhramsha (500 CE) → Early Vernaculars (~1000 CE) → Modern Languages (~1500 CE onward)**.  

Those who don't know history much for them here are important historic notes
- Mahatma Buddha and Mahavir Jain walk on this planet around 5th Century BCE.
- Adi Sanksracharya walk on this planet around 7th Century CE
- Arab invaders successfully took India around 12th Century CE
- Kabirdas Ji walk on this planet around 14th Century CE
- Guru Nanakdev Ji walk on this planet around 15th Century CE
- British Raj started in 1858, before they were just trader as East India Company
- British Raj ended in 1947 (after 90 years of rule)
- I couldn't fine any great scientific, engineering, medical, mathmetical, astrology, agriculture work in these languages which came after Sanskrit.

### **Sanskrit (~1500 BCE and more – 500 CE)**  
   - **Vedic Sanskrit (1500 BCE – 500 BCE)**: Language of the **Vedas**.  
   - **Classical Sanskrit (500 BCE – onward)**: Codified by **Panini (Aṣṭādhyāyī, ~4th century BCE)**.  
   - Used in religious texts, philosophy, and administration but was not a spoken vernacular for the masses.  

### **Prakrits (500 BCE – 500 CE)**  
   - **Evolved as spoken dialects from Sanskrit.**  
   - Used in Jain and Buddhist texts like the **Pāli Canon (Buddhism) and Jain Agamas**.  
   - Major Prakrits:  
     - **Shauraseni Prakrit** → Gave rise to **Western Hindi (Braj, Rajasthani, Khari Boli, Punjabi, Sindhi)**.  
     - **Magadhi Prakrit** → Evolved into **Bhojpuri, Maithili, Magahi, Bengali, Assamese, Odia**.  
     - **Ardhamagadhi Prakrit** → Used in Jain texts, closely related to Magadhi.  

### **Apabhramsha (500 CE – 1000 CE)**  
   - **Late-stage Prakrits**, closer to modern languages.  
   - Flourished in literature and poetry (e.g., **Hemachandra’s grammar of Apabhramsha, 12th century**).  
   - Different regional forms:  
     - **Western Apabhramsha** → Led to **Rajasthani, Gujarati, Sindhi, Brajbhasha**.  
     - **Eastern Apabhramsha** → Gave rise to **Bhojpuri, Maithili, Magahi, Bengali**.  
     - **Central Apabhramsha** → Developed into **Khari Boli, Awadhi**.  

### **Early Vernacular Languages (~1000 CE onward)**  
   - By the **10th–12th century**, Prakrit and Apabhramsha evolved into distinct **early medieval languages**, leading to **Awadhi, Braj, Bhojpuri, Rajasthani**, etc.  


## Evolution of Today's North Indian Languages
