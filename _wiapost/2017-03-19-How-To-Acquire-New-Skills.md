# How To Acquire New Skills    
## About Science and Art of Learning    
       
Science means rules, formula, process,     
Repeatability, reproducibility, scalability    
    
Art means uniqueness, unrepeatability, creativity,     
an unknown formula, an unknown process of production,     
extremely difficult to reproduced and scale.    
    
A computer program is an art for a musician     
A piece of unique music is art for a computer programmer.    
    
Something which is extremely difficult for one     
to produce is fun for others. How and why?     
Because that person has learned     
the science behind the subject.    
    
If you learn the basic rule and formula of drawing fine arts     
or music then it is less art and more science for you.     
It is fun and while dancing on the board     
you can draw the best picture    
    
If musician learn how to think the way     
computer processes code     
then it is science for him to write code.     
While talking to his friend     
he can develop a new algorithm.    
    
Where do we learn science?     
Initially our parents, teachers, mentors,     
experienced professionals teach this to us.     
They also teach us how to pay attention     
to the surrounding so that we can learn the rule on our own.    
    
All training institutes, schools, colleges, universities     
helps us downloading that science to us     
which either they have developed,     
or received from the previous generations     
or peers around them.    
    
To learn the art of a profession     
there are few places     
but to learn the science of a profession     
there are many places.    
    
After we have learned     
the old science of the profession in the classroom,     
There is a life before us to discover new science     
from the art (complexities) of our profession.    
    
Initially even riding a bicycle is art.     
After learning the rules, it becomes science.     
It looks anybody can do it.    
    
So in every science, there is an art for us,     
which we are not able to comprehend    
    
And in every art, there is some science for us     
which we can easily teach to others     
Repeat and produce exactly the same outcome as before.    
    
But learning does not end,     
when we have understood all the rules of the profession     
Learning takes new heights     
then we start observing new patterns on our own    
    
Sometimes we see such patterns     
which nobody observed before     
This is called removing the cover lying on some art     
Once we remove the cover it is a discovery     
And now it is no more art for you     
Now, it becomes science.    
    
What is science today,     
Was miracle for most of the human sometimes back.     
But it never happens that today’s science     
will become the art of tomorrow.    
    
Once we know how it works then     
There is no magic, no hidden rule     
Any person willing to put efforts to follow the steps     
will be able to reproduce     
that which is expected by the process.    
    
Therefore, when in class we pay most attention     
To learn the rules of the profession     
Whether art or engineering or medical     
or music or programming     
Whether a teacher is boring or interesting     
Keep your subject live in your mind.    
    
Apply your common sense     
And observations to assimilate     
what is being explained     
Then experiment with that rule to experience the outcome.    
    
When you are done then you have     
assimilated the basic rules of the profession    
    
Sometimes if you sit near a giant master     
Of the profession, you will learn     
Such rules which only he knows     
Because he observed it by doing     
It is not written anywhere    
    
If you learn those rules then     
your life becomes easy     
because you need not discover that jewel again.    
    
Unfortunately many of the people     
In the profession don’t pay much attention and time to learn the rules     
They want to finish the work in hand by hook or crook     
Make money, get awards and recognition     
But not ready to learn the basic rules or processes.    
    
If we don’t know even basic rule then     
where is the scope of observing patterns of a new problem?     
In this situation forget about     
scope of developing your own rules,     
Those rules, which you can share with     
your colleagues and family members    
    
Just copy-pasting text     
from one window to another window, doesn’t help.     
Storing file on the hard disk or on bookshelves doesn’t help     
Things will always remain mysterious for you.    
    
Just because you have seen some video     
or read text doesn’t give you the confidence     
that you have learned the rule.    
    
There are many high tech gadgets around us or in our hand     
And we don’t know how it works!     
Neither people are interested in learning     
Nor it is possible for all to learn all.    
    
But there must be one field in our life     
For which you know most of the rule     
It has become a science for us     
And, we still enjoy that profession     
Because we still see some patterns there     
which we didn’t know before    
    
Many experts in our field don’t know about those     
But we can do that like an artist     
Sometimes an artist puts a stroke on the canvas     
and a beautiful piece comes up.     
Not because he wanted to make good art,     
But because he has perfected the science so much that     
He cannot make a mistake     
And someday, If he deviates from the science     
then the product is a fantastic art    
    
When you are engaged with nature in such a way     
then Life is fun, more joyful and playful    
    
Life becomes boring and tiresome when     
It rolls from month to month.     
From one customer to another customer,     
From one delivery to another delivery,     
From one paycheck to the next paycheck.     
From one promotion to another.     
From one birthday to the next birthday.     
From one Friday to next Friday party.     
This way we look excuse to celebrate     
the moments of life.    
    
But when you are committed to the process     
where converting art to science is a game of every moment     
then every moment is a thrill.     
Every moment is a festival and joy.
