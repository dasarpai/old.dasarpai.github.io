# How to Engage for Imparting Knowledge    
   
The biggest counterproductive assumption a teacher     
or a trainer can make about the class is     
"they all know what they want to learn and why they want to learn".     
If so, then the problem is already known.     
Hence, letâ€™s start with a solution and give gyan to these people.     
But this assumption is wrong.    
    
Based on my training experience I can tell     
that most of the people in a class are sitting     
for a degree, certificate or pass to the next class.     
Learning is never the highest motivation.     
    
Throw some real life challenges before them.     
Bring them mentally out from their     
promotion, appreciation, recognition, salary related problems     
and ask them what they think about problem X or Y     
and how do they solve this problem?     
    
Let them give all possible solutions,    
probably the class collectively know     
much better solution than you are going to teach.     
In that situation offer your teaching as an     
alternative solution finder     
rather than giving new knowledge.    
    
But is this easy to bring people     
out from their own created cocoon in the mind and     
offer them the living of the real world?     
    
Sometimes they are surrounded by hundreds of people and     
hundreds of problems but they live in their mental cocoon.    
In that cocoon know they think they have solution     
but other people are not listening to them.    
The solution they have may be useful or useless.    
But till the time solution is discussed,     
debated, agreed it is of no use.
