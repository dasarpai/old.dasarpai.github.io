# Meditation Perspective Of A Practitioner
   
An English word Meditation has many meanings     
Today I sharing my perceptive on a Samskrut word Dhyanam,     
which is an integral part of Indian yogic traditions.    
    
Meditation is a process.     
We know any process has input, activities, and output.    
    
The duration of this process can be as short a 12 seconds.     
With this duration, we call it Dharana or concentration.     
The duration of Medication can be as large as life itself.    
    
The larger is the duration more is awareness.     
When the duration is large, the final output doesn’t matter.     
Because every moment you pass in that state     
a transformation is happening in you.     
This is the state of oneness.    
    
The degree of oneness depends upon     
the intensity of your meditation, your nature,     
and the framework being used.     
In that state, breaking the meditation     
and coming out to receive the benefits is not wise.    
    
Is output wonderful?     
The answer for that is you need to jump in     
the water to know the joy of swimming.     
Don’t ask it others.    
    
This is a process of awareness     
This is a process of dissolving your physical identity.     
This is a process of identifying yourself as nonphysical.     
This is a process of identifying yourself with the creator.    
    
This is a process of disassociation     
yourself from the entities and events around.     
This is a process of dissolving     
all named relationships.     
This is a process of owning     
only one relationship with the world around.     
The relation of a mother.     
Knowing that I am conceiver and deliverer     
of the phenomenon world around.    
    
Now, let’s see the inputs of this process     
To enter into a meditative state,     
when this process effortlessly happens in you     
you need some preparation.     
This preparation prepares     
quality input for the process.    
    
Thus input should be clean, pure, and pious     
What does it mean?     
This means the body and the mind     
with which you want to perform this process     
Should be stable, healthy, and clean.    
    
Any pain in the body, and desire     
of good or bad in the mind,     
any emotional and sensational     
disturbance in mind     
will toxify the input.    
    
Garbage in garbage out     
is the principle of process engineering.    
    
Like a copper pot, the more you clean more it shines,     
An extremely dirty pot     
if you clean for two minutes it will be clean.    
    
But it will not be as clean     
as it becomes after your rub it for ten minutes.     
If you use lemon or tamarind it will be cleaner.     
This way more time you spend to clean,     
and the higher quality material you use     
to clean more cleaner will be the copper pot.    
    
More cleaner the pot     
For more duration, you can use it     
for your rituals without cleaning again.    
    
A healthy mind and body is like that     
We know it will never be the perfect     
But our efforts to keep the input clean     
and healthy will impact the process and its outcome.    
    
After input, let us now see activities.     
Activities depend upon a method     
or a framework or a system or traditions you choose.     
You can customize these methods     
based on your need and nature     
But the overall architecture of one system remains the same.    
    
Vipassana, Shambhavi, Shoonya,     
Kundalini, Zen, Transcendental, etc     
are a few examples of the frameworks.     
A framework may emphasize more on breathing     
Or sensation or imagination or sound     
or taste or smell or Akasa or an object     
or combination of these.    
    
Some framework gives importance to the place,     
environment, body motions, and movements of eyes.     
But all emphasize on the presence of mind     
in present and awareness.    
    
Because of other life priorities,     
if you have to exit the process     
and move into either daily mundane activities     
or challenging activities     
the impact of a few minutes of intense meditation     
remains with you a whole day.    
    
How long it will remain     
it depends upon how intense was your meditation,     
what kind of activities you do a whole day,     
what environment you live in.     
what are your food and drink habits?    
    
If you avoid doing this process     
to gain some power,     
which can be used     
for your physical enjoyment     
then it will give you better results.    
    
If you do this process     
to learn how to be a witness     
of all the phenomenon world around     
be it creation or destruction,     
be it birth or death,     
be it make or break,     
be it loss or profit,     
be it coming and going     
then more you will be blessed by this process.    
    
Don’t do this process with any expectation     
(productivity, peace of mind, good relationship etc)     
Don’t do this process for any gain of future     
Don’t do this process for pleasing or showing others     
Even if you are doing it before your Deity, don’t do it for the Deity.     
Don’t do this process for acquiring occult powers.    
    
Do this process, out of love and respect     
As this is the best biggest things     
which our ancestors could give to us     
Do this process to live in the present     
for a few moments of the day.    
    
Results need not be seen and praised by others     
The result need not be explained to others     
But results will transform the way you see     
Life around, relationship, work,     
gain-loss, pain-pleasure around.    
    
O Pratibimba, could I inspire you     
for experiencing this wonderful gift     
which is available only for humans?    
    
Hari Om Tat Sat     
Yours Truly Hari
