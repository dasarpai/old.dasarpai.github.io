# **Life, Death, and the Illusion of Reasons**  

Out of habit, we ask when someone dies,  
"Oh, how did he die?"  
He was young,  
He was good, religious,  
He practiced yoga, cared for his health.  

Out of habit, we ask when someone suffers,  
"Oh, why is he suffering?"  
He is a good person,  
A virtuous soul.  
Sometimes we say,  
"He has already suffered enough,  
Why must he endure more?"  

But death and suffering need no reason.  
Reasoning is a human invention,  
A way to explain the unknown.  
Yet, suffering and death exist  
Without a cause, without a purpose.  

Culture and conditioning teach us  
To seek reasons for everything:  
Why do people fall in love?  
Why do some grow rich while others stay poor?  
Why do reputations rise and fall?  
Why does one win a lottery, another fail?  
Why do the sick die despite treatment,  
While others pass away in their sleep?  
Why do some have kind parents and teachers,  
While others suffer under 
cruel hands of parents and teachers?  

Yet, all people suffer.  
All people die.  
The poor suffer, the rich suffer.  
The believer suffers, the atheist suffers.  
The kind suffer, the wicked suffer.  
The thief, the giver,  
The young, the old,  
The sick, the healthy—  
All will suffer.  
All will die.  

What is death?  
Can anyone escape it?  
Why do scriptures make us fear death and God?  
Why do they tell us to be good  
To avoid suffering and divine wrath?  

Life does not happen for a reason.  
Life simply happens.  
Our explanations are childish illusions.  
When we are young, we believe in reasons.  
With time and experience,  
We learn that life is about acceptance.  

Do not avoid wrongdoings  
Just out of fear—  
Fear of Hell, fear of God, fear of society.  
If you commit immoral acts,  
Thinking no one sees you,  
That there is no God to judge,  
That you are free to do as you please—  
You are not an evolved soul.  

If you do good only out of fear,  
You are still not evolved—  
But you are better than the former.  

Right living is beyond religion.  
It transcends gender, culture,  
Language, geography, and belief.  
Most people need religion to guide them,  
But if you already know the right way to live,  
What more can religion offer?  

No matter what faith you follow,  
Or if you follow none,  
Pain, suffering, and loss  
Are a part of life.  
No one can take them away from you—  
Except death.
