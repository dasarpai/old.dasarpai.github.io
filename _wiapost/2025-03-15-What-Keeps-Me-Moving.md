# What Keeps Me Moving?  

Initially, the Upanishads went over me.  
Then, I went over the Upanishads -  
a journey spanning roughly 20 years.  

Now, reading self-help books or    
even religious texts feels like reading children’s books.  
They are good, engaging, but the truth lies elsewhere.  

If someone asks me   
what I have learned after reading so much,  
contemplating so deeply,  
on both worldly and inner sciences,  

I can say:  

- I can **work tirelessly to uncover the truth** and explore deeper dimensions of life, business, and technology. For me, they are all interwoven now.  
- I can **wait extraordinarily long** — with patience and a positive mind—perhaps my whole remaining life, without being disturbed much.  
- I can live with **minimal food, clothing**, and even without a proper bed for my entire life.  
- **Desire to act vs. desire for results:** I have no intention of becoming rich, famous, or powerful.  
- **Keep moving to know and express:** I keep exploring places to understand deeper truths and to express myself.  
- **Indulging vs. involving:** I can live without assigning adjectives to the nouns around me. I can live without indulging in processes or the actions I am involved in.  
- **Death is not the truth:** There is no such thing as death. There is only life -- continuing from one body to another in an infinite process until I grow tired and choose to exit the loop.  


I understand that when one gets tired, when one chooses to exit, when one sees that infinite cycle of rise and fall, when one learns the trick to transcend — that time and space doesn’t matter much. Therefore don't be in hurry. Take your time.  In an infinite life, a few births and deaths of your own are insignificant.  


Hari Om Tat Sat   
Yours Truly Hari
